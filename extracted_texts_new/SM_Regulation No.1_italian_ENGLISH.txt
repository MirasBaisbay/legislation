CHAPTER III TARIFFS AND PAYMENT METHODS 1. Art. 13 (Tariffs for the Integrated Water Service) The tariffs for the water supply and sewerage services provided by the Manager are determined by the Regulatory Authority for Public Services and Energy pursuant to Article 7 of Law No. 120 of November 20, 2001, and Delegated Decree No. 99 of July 3, 2008, and are applied by the Manager. 2. The tariffs for the services provided by the Manager listed below are determined by the Regulatory Authority for Public Services and Energy: a) connection; b) fire-fighting connection; c) temporary supplies; d) installation of the user meter; e) rental of the user meter for water supply; f) security deposit. 3. For the water supply, the tariff is established based on the type of utility, consumption brackets, and any water emergency situations, while for the sewerage service, the tariff is divided into civil and industrial utilities. 4. The user is informed of the tariff in force at the time of signing the contract. 5. During the course of the supply contract, the tariffs may vary and will be communicated through publication on the Manager's website. 6. The tariffs and charges due are paid to the Manager by the deadlines established in this Regulation. 1. Art. 14 (Contributions and Quotations) Requests for modification or relocation of the networks, equipment, plants, and structures of the Integrated Water Service under the responsibility of the Manager may also be submitted by private users. The related works are carried out by the Manager at the applicant's expense, subject to verification of technical compatibility, acceptance of the quotation, and payment according to the methods set out in Article 19, without prejudice to the payment of adjustments in case of higher costs. 2. The Manager shall establish the fees for the services indicated below: a) construction of new networks or upgrading of existing networks; b) modifications to the Manager's networks, equipment, plants, and structures; c) modifications to existing connections; d) relocation of the user meter; e) reactivation of the user meter in case of default. 3. The contribution that the applicant is required to pay to the Manager, in the cases referred to in paragraph 2, includes: a) the costs incurred by the Manager for the technical investigation, including surveys, verifications, design, and preparation of the quotation; b) the costs of executing the works carried out by the Manager. 4. Any quotation is valid for twelve months from the date of its communication to the applicant. The applicant, even if the works are not executed, is required to pay the costs related to the processing of the file, design, and preparation of the quotation. 5. The payment of contributions does not grant the user any title of ownership over the works carried out by the Manager. 6. The services referred to in letters a) and b) of paragraph 2 are carried out by the Manager compatibly with the budget provisions and the works planning of the Agency itself. 1. Art. 15 (Environmental Tariff and Collection Methods) The environmental tariff is governed by Article 95 of the Environmental Code and is established by the Regulatory Authority for Public Services and Energy. The tariff is payable to the Manager by all users of the water service. 2. For the purpose of calculating the environmental tariff, the volume of wastewater discharged into the sewer is determined according to the following criteria: a) for discharges of domestic, comparable, and industrial wastewater from utilities connected to the aqueduct, the quantity of discharged wastewater is determined to be equal to the volume of water consumed; b) for discharges from utilities that use water sources other than the public aqueduct, the tariff is applied to the volume of discharged wastewater determined by the flow meter referred to in Article 66. 3. The environmental tariff is charged on the same bill used for invoicing the aqueduct service, without prejudice to the possibility of a different application. 4. In case of irregular or non-functioning of the user meter or flow meter, the calculation of the environmental tariff is based on the average consumption of the previous two years; in the absence of historical consumption data, reference will be made to the consumption recorded on the new meter installed. 1. Art. 16 (Meter Reading) The meter is normally read twice a year; additional readings may be taken for technical or administrative reasons. The user is required to permit and facilitate, at any time, access to the meter for readings by the Manager's staff or other persons appointed by the Manager. In case of absence, the user is also required to arrange, in the manner indicated by the Manager, to communicate the meter reading or to allow it to be read by their representative. 2. The Manager gives the user the option to perform a self-reading and to communicate it by filling out the form in Annex B to this Regulation or through the tools specifically made available, with transmission costs borne by the recipient. Failure to communicate the self-reading to the Manager's designated offices will result in the charging of an estimated consumption. 3. The Manager is not required to perform a simultaneous reading of the meters in the event of changes in tariffs or taxes levied on the tariffs themselves. 4. In the case of meters showing a measurement multiplier coefficient on the totalizer, the indicated quantities will be increased according to the multiplier itself. 5. For consumption-based supplies for other uses referred to in Article 28, paragraph 3, letter b), the meter is read at the end of the usage period and in any case at least once a year. 6. The Manager is obliged to inform the user in case of detection of anomalous readings and to be available for additional verifications. 1. Art. 17 (Consumption) Water consumption is measured by a meter and is expressed in cubic meters. In the absence of a reading, the Manager may estimate consumption based on the values of the previous year. 2. In case of anomalies or failures of the meter, the Manager will determine the water consumption for the period of the device's incorrect functioning as follows: a) based on the average consumption of the previous two years; b) in the absence of historical consumption data, reference will be made to that recorded on the new meter installed. 3. In proven cases of meter tampering by the user and in the absence of reference data from previous consumption, the consumption will be determined by the Manager based on technical assessments. 1. Art. 18 (Billing Methods for the Integrated Water Service) The Manager shall issue invoices for the services offered to the user based on the contract, applying the tariffs referred to in Article 13. 2. Domestic utilities that are not connected to the public sewer system and that provide for their own wastewater treatment pursuant to Article 69 are not required to pay the environmental tariff, subject to notification to the Manager by filling out the appropriate form in Annex C to this Regulation. 3. The billing frequency is normally quarterly and in any case carried out four times a year. The Manager reserves the right to change the billing frequency, providing adequate written notice to the users. 4. For the services referred to in Article 14, the invoice is normally issued upon acceptance of the quotation. 5. Supplies are normally billed with a charge for estimated consumption and a subsequent adjustment. If a reading is not provided, the Manager will bill an estimated consumption, subject to adjustment at the next reading. 6. For supplies with consumption exceeding 200 m³ per month, monthly billing is applied with a charge for actual consumption, with the reading carried out by the Manager through its representative, in the event of a declaration of a water emergency as per Article 37 or in cases established by the regulatory authority for services or by special regulations. 7. Concurrently with the amounts for consumption, other due amounts are charged, such as: a) fixed fees; b) tariffs for sewerage and treatment services; c) annual fee based on the number and diameter of hydrants installed for fire-fighting supplies; d) fees for ancillary services provided by the Manager; e) expense reimbursements; f) security deposit; g) stamp duty; h) rounding of invoiced amounts; i) contribution for hidden leak insurance; l) late payment penalty for overdue invoices. 8. In the case of a centralized water system, the Manager does not apportion the consumption; the invoice, however, takes into account the number of property units. 9. The Manager may vary the billing items and the billing system by providing prior notice to the users. 1. Art. 19 (Payments) Invoices are sent to the address indicated by the contract holder or to another person indicated by them. 2. Payment is made by the due date indicated on the invoice using the pre-printed form attached to it, according to the instructions on the document, or by other provided methods such as direct debit. 3. Payments for the services referred to in Article 30, paragraph 3, are made in advance. 4. For the services referred to in Article 14, upon acceptance of the quotation for the execution of the works, the applicant is required to pay the entire amount quoted by the Manager before the service is provided, without prejudice to the payment of adjustments in case of higher costs. 5. In the case of bills with a credit amount, they are refunded on subsequent invoices. The Manager may carry out accounting set-offs between debts and credits of the same holder referring to different contracts. 6. Art. 20 (Late Payment and Formal Notice) In case of late payment, thirty days after the due date of the invoice, the user is put on formal notice by means of a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt containing an indication of the final payment deadline and a notice that, after said deadline, the Manager may proceed to suspend the service, without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 7 of Article 35 and the Manager's right to proceed according to the procedure governed by Delegated Decree No. 131 of August 7, 2014. 1. If payment is delayed beyond the due dates indicated on the invoice, without prejudice to the right to suspend the supply and terminate the contract, the Manager will apply a late payment penalty, calculated on the amount of the sums due, as follows: a) up to 10 days, a late payment penalty of 1%; b) from 10 to 30 days, a late payment penalty of 3%; c) over 30 days, a late payment penalty of 5%. 1. Art. 21 (Information and Complaints) Information on consumption, payments, and supply amounts is provided only to the contract holders. If the contract holder is a condominium, the information may also be given, upon written request, to the actual members of the condominium. 2. Any complaint that the user wishes to make regarding the invoices must be addressed to the Manager by the due date of the invoice. The Manager will respond to written complaints within fifteen days from the date of receipt. 3. Any pending complaints or disputes do not entitle the user to defer or suspend payments. 4. The payment of an invoice does not release the user from the charge for any previous consumption or services not invoiced or from the payment of charges erroneously not imputed. CHAPTER IV PROVISIONS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF NETWORKS AND CONNECTIONS Art. 22 (Construction of Networks) 1. The networks and connections, even if on private land and/or with contributions from private individuals, are the property of the Manager, and the subsequent operation and maintenance activities are the responsibility of the same Manager. 2.

This category also includes cases of mixed-use supply (domestic use and other use). 1. Art. 29 (Prohibited Water Abstractions) The abstraction of water is strictly prohibited: a) from public fountains for uses other than for drinking and fire-fighting, including by attaching pipes to the dispensing outlets for the purpose of conveying or removing water; b) from public and private fire hydrants, except for extinguishing fires or for adequate functional checks; c) from public service areas in campsites for washing cars, caravans, trailers, and the like; d) upstream of the user meter or in its absence, with the exception of flat-rate contracts. 1. Art. 30 (Supplies for Temporary Use) A water supply is considered for temporary use when it is used for occasional purposes and for a limited duration. 2. The Manager grants supplies for temporary use by creating temporary connections and installing user meters for construction sites and for fairs, sports, cultural, and recreational events lasting more than thirty days. 3. Flat-rate supply contracts, without a user meter, are permitted for festivals, fairs, shows, sports, cultural, and recreational events lasting less than 30 days. 4. The Manager may issue requirements dictated by particular needs. 5. The user shall bear the costs of installing and removing the temporary connection. These costs also include a suitable security deposit to guarantee against any insolvencies, according to the methods established by the Manager. 1. Art. 31 (Methods of Water Supply) The Manager supplies water for the uses provided for in the Regulation in return for the fees established for the activation and provision of the service. 2. The supply of water, for both public and private use, is carried out by the Manager upon express request of the interested party and is normally provided on a free-flow basis, measured by a suitable device (user meter). 1. Art. 32 (Conditions for Water Supply and Right to Supply) The Manager supplies water for the uses provided for in the Regulation, in areas already served by the distribution network, in return for the contributions established for the activation and supply of water and following the stipulation of a specific contract according to the procedures provided for in this Regulation. 2. The aqueduct works are carried out by the Manager. In cases where supply requests in areas already served by aqueduct networks cannot be met as a result of changes in land use or urban transformation interventions, the upgrading works shall be at the total expense of the parties implementing the interventions. Upgrading works for networks and plants in areas already served and characterized by structural deficiencies shall be at the expense of the applicant. 3. In areas not served by a distribution network and for which the Manager's works program does not foresee extension interventions, the Manager shall carry out the works related to the provision of the service, which shall be charged to the applicant as indicated in the quotation referred to in Article 14. 4. Pursuant to Article 159 of Law No. 140/2017, the connection of temporary structures and accessories for agricultural use is not permitted. 5. For all new connections, minimum levels of water quantities and pressure are guaranteed. 6. The Manager guarantees each user that the water supply will have a minimum pressure of 0.15 MPa measured at the highest habitable floor level and a maximum pressure of 0.8 MPa measured at street level. CHAPTER II RULES FOR WATER SUPPLY 1. Art. 33 (Procedure for Modifying the Type of Supply and for Varying the Supply) In the event that the user requests a modification of the type of water supply, they must submit a new application. If this request involves a modification of the service line and/or the meter, the user is required to pay the relevant contributions. 2. In the event that the user requests a variation in supply (increase in flow rate) within the same use category, they must submit a new application. If it is necessary to modify the service line and/or the meter, the user is required to pay the relevant contributions. 3. The modifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 result in the modification of the supply contracts. 1. Art. 34 (Variations in Pressure and Flow Rate) The pressure at the points of delivery and the flow rates supplied are those permitted by the existing network and may be subject to limitations or suspensions due to works or force majeure. 2. The Manager reserves the right to make changes in pressure at the point of delivery for reasons of overall service efficiency. 3. Should the variations referred to in the preceding paragraphs be definitive and likely to cause significant changes to the pre-existing supply conditions, the information will be promptly provided to the users both in direct written form and through the local press, so that they have the necessary time to make any adjustments to their internal systems, at their own care and expense, to the new pressure regime. 4. The repairs of faults that may arise in the internal systems due to their failure to adapt will also be at the care and expense of the individual users. Art. 35 (Suspension of Water Supply) 1. The Manager has no liability and is not required to pay compensation of any kind for consequential damages in the event of suspension of the supply for the following causes attributable to the user, after sending a payment reminder and charging the related expense, if: a) the amount of the connection charges has not been paid after the supply has started; b) the user has not paid the supply invoice within the specified terms. 2. The Manager cannot be held responsible for any damages resulting from the suspension of the supply after sending a formal notice letter by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, when the user has not taken steps to restore the conditions of regularity and safety of the supply in the following cases: a) irregularities in the execution of the internal system; b) the user's opposition to the inspection and reading of the user meter by the Manager; c) the user's opposition to the inspection of the internal system by the Manager; d) failure by the user to make the modifications requested by the Manager, in case of irregularities found in the internal system by the Manager or of danger to persons or property; e) opposition to the relocation of the user meter for network modernization planned by the Manager. 3. The Manager has no liability and is not required to pay compensation of any kind for damages resulting from: a) confirmed water leaks or faults at construction sites; b) tampering with the seals of the user meter; c) tampering with the user meter and publicly owned works; d) use of the water resource for a water use category or for a property different from that for which the contract was stipulated; e) transfer of water to third parties. 4. In the case of suspension of service for non-payment, the supply is reactivated within the first working day after the user has demonstrated that they have made all overdue payments, including reactivation costs. 5. The user is required to comply with contractual obligations, including the payment of the fixed supply fee, until the service is suspended. 6. If thirty days have passed since the suspension of the service for the cases referred to in paragraph 1 without the user having regularized their situation by eliminating the cause of the suspension, the contract is considered terminated for breach, and the Manager will send a communication by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt to the user. 7. The Manager is required to guarantee domestic utilities a minimum supply of water for essential uses, equal to 50 liters per person per day. 1. Art. 36 (Interruptions and Limitations of the Water Service) The Manager shall adopt the Programmed Interruption Management Plan, providing, among other things, for the timing and methods of giving advance notice to users. 2. The Manager shall take every care to ensure that the supply is provided with the utmost regularity. In case of a supply deficiency due to any cause of force majeure, the Manager may impose appropriate limitations on consumption and uses. 3. In the case of interruptions related to network interventions, the Manager undertakes to limit the duration of the disruption to the minimum necessary, always compatibly with the technical problems that have arisen. 4. Should shortages or suspensions of service occur for a period longer than twenty-four hours, the Manager undertakes to activate an emergency substitute service. 5. Utilities that by their nature require absolute continuity of service shall, at their own care and expense, install an adequate backup system. 6. Interruptions or limitations of flow rate, as well as pressure fluctuations and the deposit of residues from the network in users' appliances, do not create an obligation for the Manager to pay compensation. 7. The water supply may be interrupted by the Manager at any time, without prior notice and without this giving rise to any claim for compensation, exclusively in the event of sudden breakdowns, exceptional circumstances, technical or hygienic reasons, or situations of imminent danger to persons or property. The Manager is required to restore the water supply as quickly as possible. Art. 37 (Reduction of Water Consumption in Emergency Situations) 1. Pursuant to Decree-Law No. 82 of July 4, 2007, in water emergency situations characterized by an excess of consumption compared to the availability of the aqueduct network supply system, the Manager shall inform users of the need to reduce water consumption, apply tariff increases, and, to this end, adopt the technical solutions deemed most appropriate. 1. Art. 38 (Obligations of the User) Users are required to: a) take the utmost care in finding and immediately eliminating faults and other anomalies in general in their systems that may cause water leaks, high consumption, disruption of the public network, or its contamination; b) not alter the tapping and measuring devices; c) not tamper with the seals and immediately notify the Manager in the event of their possible breakage; d) comply with the instructions provided by the Manager for the protection of the tapping devices and the user meter against mechanical action, frost, or other agents. 1. Art. 39 (Reactivation of the Water Utility) A user interested in reactivating a previously terminated water utility shall arrange for the signing of a new contract, the payment of the relevant stamp duties, the security deposit, as well as the payment of any amounts due in case of arrears. 1. Art. 40 (Inspections) The Manager reserves the right to inspect its systems located within the user's property by means of its own personnel or other appointed staff (equipped with an identification card) in order to ascertain their correct functionality and thus the correct provision of the service, both during periodic checks and in the case of presumed or confirmed faults. CHAPTER III CONNECTIONS TO THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK 1. Art. 41 (Application for Connection for Water Supply) The natural or legal person interested in the water supply shall submit a written application by filling out the appropriate form in Annex E to this Regulation. 2. The application must indicate the type of supply pursuant to Article 28. 3. Within a period of fifteen working days, the Manager shall inform the applicant of the cost estimate for the execution of the connection, as well as the expected time for the execution of the works and the payment methods for the contribution referred to in Article 14. 4. The payment of the connection contribution does not grant the user any title of ownership over the works carried out by the Manager. 5. No other charge, beyond those expressly indicated in the quotation after its delivery, may be imposed on the applicant for the quoted service, with the exception of the contribution for the user meter. Art. 42 (User Meters) 1. The user meters are the property of the Manager, who is responsible for their installation. 2. The user meters are normally installed within the private property, adjacent to the boundary with the public road. 3. If there are doubts about the accuracy of the property boundaries, the applicant for the connection must produce supporting technical documentation indicating the exact boundaries. The applicant is in any case responsible for the information provided and in case of disputes over the nature of the boundaries. 4. At the time of installation, the Manager shall place a special seal on the user meters, which may not be removed or tampered with, as well as an identification tag for the user meter. 5. User meters may never be removed or moved except by order of the Manager and exclusively by personnel appointed by it. The Manager may, however, replace and modify the user meters, at its own expense, whenever it deems it appropriate. 6. All user meters serving the building must always be in a position suitable for easy inspection and reading, sheltered from frost and excessive heat, rain, or other unsuitable conditions, and placed in special underground pits or in special above-ground enclosures. 7. In the case of installing a bank of user meters serving various property units that make up the building, it is the users' responsibility to ensure the correct connection of the internal systems of said units to their respective user meters, according to the Manager's instructions. The Manager declines all responsibility in case of billing errors due to incorrect connection by the user of the individual internal systems to their respective user meters. 8. In case of irregular or non-functioning user meters, the consumption is calculated based on the user's historical consumption. In the absence of historical consumption data, the Manager uses the consumption of similar user categories as a reference. 9. In the event that the user meter is found to be deteriorated or illegible for reasons not attributable to the user, it shall be replaced at the care and expense of the Manager. 10. The costs for repairs and any replacements of user meters, in cases where the fault is due to malice or negligence on the part of the user, are borne by the user. 11. Upon removal or replacement of user meters, the relevant reports shall be drawn up on special forms prepared by the Manager, signed by the user and the Manager's representatives. A copy of the report is given to the user. Art. 43 (Verification of the Functioning of the User Meter) 1. When the user believes the measurements indicated by the user meter are erroneous, they may request the Manager to verify its suitability. The user meter is removed and replaced by the Manager. 2. User meters are considered unsuitable when the percentage error, determined as the arithmetic mean of the percentage errors resulting from the verification of the user meter at various test flow rates, exceeds the value of 5%. 3. If the verification confirms correct functioning, the Manager shall charge the user the cost of the verification expenses. 4. If the verification certifies the irregular functioning of the user meter, the Manager shall recalculate the consumption for the period between the last reading and the replacement of the user meter, defining the amount corresponding to the measurement error found. CHAPTER IV TECHNICAL RULES 1. Art. 44 (Dimensions of the Connection) The diameter of the connection is established by the Manager, taking into consideration the constraints related to the diameter of the street pipe, the supply capacity of the aqueduct, and the needs of the water service. 2. In the case of separate systems, for the purpose of defining the dimensions of the connection and the user meters, the Manager, based on the number of utilities to be served, adopts the following criteria: a) 1 Utility – 1 user meter DN 15 - connection DN 25; b) 2 Utilities - 2 user meters DN 15 - connection DN 25; c) 3 Utilities - 3 user meters DN 15 - connection DN 25; d) 4 Utilities - 4 user meters DN 15 - connection DN 25; e) 5 Utilities - 5 user meters DN 15 - connection DN 25; f) 6 Utilities – 6 user meters DN 15 - connection DN 40; g) Up to 10 Utilities – 10 user meters DN 15 - connection DN 40; h) Over 10 Utilities – over 10 user meters – DN 15 - connection DN 50. 3. In the cases referred to in letters g) and h) of paragraph 2, the Manager shall evaluate the advisability of installing the user meters in a special enclosure, suitably insulated for frost protection and with adequate closures. 4. In the case of centralized water systems, for the purpose of defining the dimensions of the connection and the user meters, based on the number of utilities to be served, the following criteria are adopted: a) 2 Utilities - 1 centralized user meter DN 20 - connection DN 25; b) 3 Utilities - 1 centralized user meter DN 20 - connection DN 25; c) 4 Utilities - 1 centralized user meter DN 25 - connection DN 25; d) 5 Utilities - 1 centralized user meter DN 25 - connection DN 25; e) 6 Utilities - 1 centralized user meter DN 25 – connection DN 25; f) from 7 to 10 Utilities - 1 centralized user meter DN 40 – connection DN 40. 5. The fire-fighting meter may not have a caliber greater than DN 50, for which a suitable service line shall be constructed. 6. 1. Art. 45 (Caliber of the User Meter) The choice of the user meter caliber is made by the Manager based on technical reasons of operation and management of the networks and in order to prevent exceptional supplies from creating difficulties for the distribution network, without prejudice to the Manager's compliance with the minimum performance standards provided for in the supply contract. 2. Depending on the network pressure, the water flow rate of the user meter may vary. The nominal flow rate of the user meter, for pressures between 0.25 MPa and 0.4 MPa, is represented in the following scheme: a) DN15 Q=2.5 m³/h; b) DN20 Q=4.0 m³/h; c) DN25 Q=6.3 m³/h; d) DN40 Q=16 m³/h; e) DN50 Q=25 m³/h. Art. 46 (Fire-fighting Systems) 1. Hydrants may only be used in case of fire or to carry out any periodic checks. In case of periodic checks, given the probable disturbance that is generated in the public network, the user shall give prior notice to the Manager. 2. The Manager cannot guarantee the continuity of operation and the flow rate to the fire-fighting system in case of faults or outages of the distribution network, as well as variations in the availability of flow rate at different times of the day. Art. 47 (Protection of the Distribution Network - Hydraulic Backflow Preventer) 1. Utilities equipped with tanks, water storage devices, or pressurized systems must install a hydraulic backflow preventer in order to prevent contamination of the distribution network in case of pressure loss. 2. The fire-fighting network must be equipped with a hydraulic backflow preventer. 3. The hydraulic backflow preventer is installed at the user's care and expense inside an enclosure suitably insulated for frost protection and with adequate closures. 4. Should the Manager ascertain that the utilities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 have not complied with the requirements of this article, it may, after a formal warning, suspend the water supply until regularization has occurred. 1. Art. 48 (Verifications by the Manager) The employees and/or representatives of the Manager, equipped with an identification card, shall periodically verify consumption, ascertain alterations and faults in the pipes and measuring devices, in order to ensure the regularity of the system and the water supply. 2. In case of the verifications referred to in paragraph 1, the user is required to provide their availability and cooperation and has the right to be present or be represented. CHAPTER V RULES FOR INTERNAL SYSTEMS 1. Art. 49 (General Information on Internal Systems) The user is responsible for the correct operation and maintenance of the internal systems. 2. Internal systems must be provided with a declaration of conformity drawn up by legally authorized installers. 3. The user must install a stop valve downstream of the user meter to be operated for their own needs and those of the Manager. 4. The internal system may not be used as an earth connection for electrical systems. 5. All responsibility and costs regarding the construction, operation, and maintenance of the internal systems are borne by the user, and the Manager cannot, in any way or for any reason, be held liable for damages that may occur in the internal systems themselves. In particular, the user is always and exclusively responsible towards third parties for any damage connected with the internal system and its operation. Art. 50 (Insurance Coverage for Hidden Leaks in Internal Systems) 1. Users who have subscribed to the policy are insured for coverage of hidden leaks in the internal system. 2. The water leak must result from a rupture that occurred downstream of the user meter on the internal system, not in view and not directly and clearly detectable from the outside. 3. To be considered a "water leak," it must have registered an anomalous consumption greater than 50% of the average consumption of the last two years; alternatively, in the absence of such data, the average of the last twelve months. 4. The activation of the insurance coverage requires the user to fill out the claim notification form. The form is available from the Manager or can be downloaded from the Manager's website. TITLE III SEWERAGE SERVICE CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS 1. Art. 51 (Preliminary Provisions) This Regulation establishes the rules for the discharge of wastewater into the sewerage networks. Discharges of domestic or comparable wastewater are permitted in compliance with Article 70 and Article 78, paragraph 9 of the Environmental Code and this Regulation. 2. Discharges of industrial wastewater must be previously authorized by the Technical Board (CT) referred to in Article 4 of the Environmental Code, as established by Article 78 of the Environmental Code. 3. The sewerage networks consist of two separate channels, as defined in Article 62, paragraph 1, letter z) of the Environmental Code. 4. The collection of stormwater must be carried out separately from that of domestic, comparable to domestic, and industrial wastewater on private land, as established by Article 126 of the Consolidated Act. 1. Art. 52 (Obligation to Connect to the Sewerage Network) Discharges of domestic wastewater and wastewater comparable to domestic must be connected to the sewerage network. The AASS issues an opinion in the cases referred to in Article 57, paragraph 8, of the Consolidated Act. 2. Discharges of industrial wastewater must be authorized by the CT pursuant to Article 78 of the Environmental Code. As a rule, discharges of industrial wastewater are connected to the sewerage network. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 do not apply to isolated buildings, i.e., those located at a distance from the sewer collector greater than 50+S/4 meters; where S is the plan area of the building in square meters. For isolated buildings, the technical requirements of Article 69 of this Regulation apply to permit discharge onto land. 4. In the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the possibility of discharge onto land pursuant to Article 71, paragraph 1, letter c, of the Environmental Code is reserved. 5. Stormwater runoff may be discharged onto land if surface delivery is possible, and it must be prevented from flowing onto neighboring properties and/or the public roadway. 1. Art. 53 (Provisions for Existing Sewer Discharges) The Manager, pursuant to Article 79, paragraph 3-ter, of the Environmental Code, shall define the intervention methods for the connection of residential areas for which sewerage networks do not exist or are not correctly separated, by establishing Intervention Plans based on the Water Management and Protection Plan referred to in Article 94 of the Environmental Code and on budget availability. 2. In the case of existing discharges, within the times indicated in the Water Management and Protection Plan and within the term provided for by Article 79, paragraph 3-quater of the Environmental Code: a) if the public sewer system is existing and separate, the Manager shall appoint personnel from the administration and/or private structures to verify the correct connection to the public sewerage network and the separation of the sewerage networks within the private property; b) if the public sewer system is not existing or is not separate, the Manager shall complete the construction or upgrading works based on the Intervention Plans, requiring the adaptation of the connection; c) in the case of isolated buildings as referred to in Article 52, paragraph 3, the Manager shall require the adaptation of the connection according to the requirements of Article 69. 3. The costs of adaptation referred to in paragraph 2 are the responsibility of the network owner, as specified in Article 54. Art. 54 (Limits of Responsibility) 1. The sewerage network under the responsibility of the discharge holder begins at the collection points and ends at, and includes, the connection manhole to the Manager's network. 2. The sewerage network under the responsibility of the Manager begins at the discharge holder's connection manhole and includes all the channels and plants up to the treatment plants for discharge into the environment. Art. 55 (Execution of Connections) 1. The Manager shall carry out the connection works to the manhole directly or through authorized entities. 2. For discharges of domestic and comparable to domestic wastewater as referred to in Article 70, paragraph 6 of the Environmental Code, a single connection point to the Manager's sewerage network is provided for each building, located within the private property and on its boundary, pursuant to Article 126 of Law No. 140 of December 14, 2017 (Consolidated Act) if the sewer collector is outside the private property, while it will be located near the sewer collector if the latter is on the same private property. 3. Multiple connections may be made for the same building if this is necessary for technical or safety reasons assessed by the Manager, based on the diagram shown in type 1 of Annex F to this Regulation. 4. In "row house" type settlements or in those where above-ground buildings are located at a distance of less than ten meters from each other, no more than one connection shall be made for every two property units, based on the diagram shown in type 2 of Annex F to this Regulation. 5. For the purpose of allowing inspection and sampling, industrial discharges must have a separate connection point from that of discharges comparable to domestic, and a dedicated inspection and sampling manhole. The sampling manhole shall be installed on the discharge holder's land, near the property boundary, upstream of the point of discharge into the public sewer, in a position easily accessible to the authorized personnel. 6. For the discharge of stormwater runoff, a single connection point to the Manager's sewerage network is provided for each building, located within the private property and on its boundary, pursuant to Article 126 of Law No. 140/2017 (Consolidated Act). The same requirements as in paragraphs 3 and 4 relating to wastewater apply to stormwater runoff. Art. 56 (Discharge Limits) 1. Upon request for connection, the Manager shall verify the wastewater flow rate for which conveyance is requested, the discharge level admissible for operation, and shall communicate the results to the applicant. 2. When critical flow conditions occur in the sewerage networks, the Manager may require, upon verification of the technical attachments to the discharge activation application, that special measures be adopted to limit the quantity or maintain the quality of the wastewater within certain limits. 3. Increases in flow rate that require the upgrading of the discharge networks are accepted by the Manager subject to the adaptation of the said networks based on the Manager's Intervention Plans. Art. 57 (Prohibited Discharges) 1. The prohibitions on discharging into the public sewer system are governed by Article 75 of the Environmental Code. 2. The Manager has the right to propose to the Commission for Environmental Protection (hereinafter referred to as CTA) the integration of the list of substances whose discharge and release into the sewerage network is prohibited, as per Article 75 of the Environmental Code, as well as to request the adoption of special treatment requirements before discharge into the public sewerage network. 3. In the case of accidental or unintentional spills into the sewerage network, the provisions of Articles 159 and 163 of the Environmental Code shall apply. 4. In case of irregularities in the discharge, the Manager shall initiate procedures for compensation for the damages suffered. CHAPTER II RULES FOR SEWERAGE SERVICE Art. 58 (Application for Connection) 1. The application for connection for the discharge of domestic and comparable to domestic wastewater is submitted by a natural or legal person to the Manager, using the model in Annex G to this Regulation. 2. In the application, the applicant shall specify the maximum expected discharge flow rate for both stormwater and foul water. 3. For industrial wastewater discharges, the application is submitted using the model in Annex H to this Regulation, subject to the issuance of the permit referred to in Article 52, paragraph 2. For the discharge and disposal of industrial wastewater, a contract is drawn up according to the model in Annex I. 4. The Manager shall evaluate the wastewater flow rate and, after conducting an inspection through the technicians of its service, shall communicate the acceptance of the application, formulating any technical requirements. 5. In case of an increase in the quantity of conveyed wastewater or a modification of the discharge point into the sewer, the holder is required to notify the Manager, updating the contract according to Annex I of this Regulation. Should the variation involve modifications to the sewer connection, said modification will be at the applicant's expense. 6. The network Manager is not responsible for malfunctions, flooding, or backflows in the user's internal network due to the failure to request an upgrade. 7. For wastewater from activities not falling under the cases of paragraph 6 of Article 70 of the Environmental Code, not previously characterized by the CTA, the Manager shall forward a request to the CTA itself for characterization. Art. 59 (Revocation of the Permit for Industrial Wastewater Discharges) 1. The Manager shall report to the Office for Prevention and Environment (hereinafter referred to as UPA) cases of non-compliance with the limits contained in Annex J of the Environmental Code, with the requirements possibly formulated by the CT when issuing the permit, as well as non-compliance with the requirements of Article 60. 2. The revocation of the permit for industrial wastewater discharges is ordered by the CT pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 3 of the Environmental Code. 3. As of the date of notification of the measure referred to in paragraph 2, the discharge holder must cease all discharge into the sewerage network, assuming at their own expense all direct or indirect liability connected with any continuation of the discharge. 4. If the Manager finds that the discharge holder has not suspended the discharge of wastewater into the network, it has the right to interrupt and seal the sewer connection by intervening downstream of the delivery manhole. 5. In case of revocation, the connection contract stipulated with the Manager is terminated by right. A holder who intends to discharge wastewater into the sewer again must stipulate a new contract according to the model in Annex I to this Regulation, after obtaining the permit from the CT, and stipulate a new contract with the Manager. In the cases referred to in paragraph 4, the restoration of the sewer connection is at the holder's expense. 1. Art. 60 (Requirements for Wastewater Treatment) In application of Article 74 of the Environmental Code, discharge holders are required to comply with the following provisions: a) wastewater from slaughterhouses shall be subjected to the separation and collection of blood, stomach contents, scraps of meat and fat, and the recovery of fats by means of special pits; b) dregs and pomace from grape vinification shall be collected and disposed of separately; c) solid processing waste from canning industries shall be collected and disposed of separately; d) spent baths from pickling, dephosphating, and any other surface treatment of metals shall be collected, before purification, in containers suitable to prevent accidental spillage into the sewer; e) spent or emulsified oils shall be collected and disposed of separately; f) runoff water from any piles of materials exposed to atmospheric agents or from surfaces affected by potential spills of fuels, oils, or other similar substances shall be subjected, before discharge into the sewer, to any pre-treatment such as sedimentation, flotation, or other, in a special plant sized so as to prevent the transport of said substances according to the requirements of the UPA; g) fuel distributors, car washes, mechanical workshops, auto electricians, body shops, paint shops, scrapping activities, and buildings and installations that may give rise to discharges, even occasional, into the stormwater, combined, or foul sewer, of hydrocarbons, settleable substances, and the like, must install suitable separators to retain such substances and keep them in a continuously efficient condition. The separators shall be sized according to the quality and quantity of the wastewater to be treated, be periodically cleaned as needed; the separated material shall be properly disposed of; h) discharges from kitchens for communities/groups (restaurants, rotisseries, canteens, etc.) shall be subjected, before discharge into the sewer, to fat separation treatment or other suitable forms of treatment; i) wastewater from condensing boilers must be connected to the internal foul water network. 2. The discharge of organic residues into the public sewer system through the use of kitchen food waste disposers is prohibited. CHAPTER III ASSESSMENTS AND SAMPLING 1. Art. 61 (Assessments) In order to verify compliance with the provisions of the Regulation and to achieve the quality objectives set for discharges from public sewers, the Manager shall organize an assessment service, using personnel from the administration and/or certified private structures. 2. The Manager shall control discharges into public sewerage networks upstream of the discharge point into the receiving bodies, along the sewerage networks, and in sections of its own choosing. 3. The Manager shall also control discharges of industrial wastewater and wastewater comparable to domestic into public sewerage networks in the inspection and sampling manhole having the technical characteristics indicated in Annex L to this Regulation. 4. The results of the controls referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be recorded on forms conforming to Annex M, for the purpose of verifying the separation of waters and determining the quality of the wastewater. For industrial wastewater and wastewater comparable to domestic, the concentration values of the substances present in the discharge and the permissible limits are verified by sampling. 5. The Manager has the right to affix, remove, or replace security seals on the measurement instruments installed (flow meter, automatic sampling instrument) at the premises of the discharge holders, for the purpose of controlling the quality and quantity parameters of interest for the management of the sewerage system and for the application of tariffs. Art. 62 (Sampling) 1. The following technical standards in force in Italy shall apply to sampling: a) APAT CNR IRSA 1030 Manual 29 2003 "Sampling Methods"; b) UNI EN ISO 5667-1:2007 "Water quality - Sampling - Part 1: Guidance on the design of sampling programmes and sampling techniques"; c) UNI EN ISO 5667-3:2013 "Water quality – Sampling - Part 3: Preservation and handling of water samples". 2. The measurement methods used for determining the values of chemical, physical, and microbiological parameters refer to Table 2/1 of Annex I of the Environmental Code. 3. Sampling, preservation, and transport are carried out by the personnel referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 61. 4. The discharge holder is informed of the day, time, and place where the sampling will be carried out. The holder or their delegate may be present, possibly with the assistance of a technical consultant. 5. Sampling is carried out by taking at least two samples, one of which is delivered to the discharge holder or their delegate. A security seal with a tamper-proof label is applied to each sample container, indicating the sampling date, the report number, the nature and quantity of the substance collected, and the signatures of the reporting officers and the holder or their delegate present during the operations. 6. A specific report of the sampling operations is drawn up according to the model in Annex N to this Regulation, a copy of which is delivered on site to the holder or their delegate. The report also indicates any irregularities found, as well as inconveniences or maintenance operations or interruptions, even temporary, that may modify the discharge. 7. The test report is available to the holder at the Manager's offices. The results of the sample analyses are communicated to the discharge holder in case of non-conformity with the provisions of the permit. 8. The quality of the wastewater for the purpose of determining the tariff is established based on the results of the sampling. 9. In the case of discharge of wastewater with parameters that are not constant in flow rate and/or quality, the Manager has the right to install, for the period of time it deems necessary, a special automatic sampling instrument. 10. The personnel in charge of the controls must be provided, upon request and in the cases provided for, with the documentation relating to the permit issued by the competent Authority, complete with all attachments. In its absence, the Manager shall inform the competent Authority for the verification of the discharge holder's position and for the adoption of any measures in case of irregularities. 11. The Manager shall communicate to the UPA any non-compliances with the Environmental Code and this Regulation, as prescribed by Article 183 of the Environmental Code. CHAPTER IV TECHNICAL RULES 1. Art. 63 (First Flush Rainwater) For activities where the spillage of processed materials onto yards or access roads and/or the direct runoff of materials and equipment is foreseeable, it is mandatory to separate first flush rainwater from stormwater runoff. 2. The obligation referred to in the preceding paragraph concerns the following activities: a) petroleum industry: extraction, processing, deposit, storage, and sale, including fuel distributors; b) non-energy mineral industry: extraction, processing, deposit, storage, including salt production; c) metallurgical industry: extraction, processing, surface treatment, deposit, storage, and sale of metallic materials; d) food and tobacco industry; e) textile industries; f) tanning industries and dyeing activities; g) paper industry; h) chemical industry, including the production of synthetic and artificial fibers, the processing of rubber and plastic materials; i) l) manufacture of mechanical and electrical machinery and apparatus; m) manufacture, repair, deposit, scrapping, and demolition of means of transport; n) places for the collection, deposit, storage, and processing of waste. 3. First flush rainwater is collected and discharged to the Manager separately from stormwater. Second flush rainwater and stormwater are discharged into the Manager's stormwater network. 4. The CT, pursuant to Article 77 of the Environmental Code, shall issue requirements on the treatment of first flush rainwater and on the quantity of water that can be qualified as first flush. 5. The separation of first flush rainwater is carried out by installing special accumulation systems, rain control systems, lifting stations, or by systems that guarantee equivalent treatment for the purpose of environmental protection. 6. All works related to the accumulation and treatment systems for first flush rainwater are carried out and managed at the care and expense of the discharge holder, and the structures are positioned within private areas. 7. The design documents relating to first flush treatments are attached to the application for connection to the public sewerage network submitted to the Manager. 1. Art. 64 (Technical and Construction Requirements for the Execution of Connections) Connections to the sewerage network are executed in the positions indicated by the Manager based on orographic conditions, the technical characteristics of the network, and the needs for maintenance, repair, and control of the networks, as well as the consequent restoration works on public roads. 2. The networks, in the section affecting the roadway or public area, must follow the shortest path to reach the discharge points, or be perpendicular to the axis of the street pipe. At the point of discharge into the public sewer, the pipe must not occupy the useful section of the main conduit. 3. The connection channels to the public sewer within private properties must have characteristics of resistance to corrosion, crushing, abrasion, and temperatures up to 100 ºC, have absolute impermeability, and be installed so as to guarantee a correct passage of wastewater. 4. In addition to the requirements of Article 70, paragraph 2, the connection manhole to the Manager's sewerage network must be equipped with "Florence-type" traps with double inspection. A manhole is constructed for each type of water discharged (stormwater, domestic or comparable wastewater, industrial wastewater). 5. The position of the connection manhole and its accessibility conditions are indicated at the time of submitting the connection request. The delivery point is agreed upon with the discharge holder, based on the configuration of the public sewerage network, the need to respect existing utilities, and in compliance with the discharge limits of Article 56. 6. The construction and maintenance of the manhole are the responsibility of the discharge holder, who also remains responsible for its correct functionality. 7. The sizing of the pipe between the public sewerage network and the connection manhole is determined by the Manager based on the discharge flow rate requested in the application. 8. The lifting of wastewater or stormwater is permitted, with installation and management costs entirely borne by the applicant, with discharge upstream of the connection manhole, in compliance with the discharge limits of Article 56. In order to avoid pressurization of the discharge pipes, downstream of the lift station and before the discharge manhole, the use of a disconnection manhole maintained at atmospheric pressure, used as an open vessel, is mandatory. 9. A lift station equipped with a backflow prevention device shall be provided, at the care and expense of the applicant, if gravity discharge of the wastewater into the public sewer is not possible. 10. The elimination of the septic tank or Imhoff tank is possible for domestic or comparable to domestic discharges that flow into a separate sewer system. CHAPTER V RULES FOR INTERNAL SYSTEMS 1. Art. 65 (Wastewater Treatment Plants) The construction and maintenance of industrial wastewater treatment plants before discharge into the sewer are carried out at the care and expense of the discharge holder. 2. The deactivation of treatment plants for maintenance work shall be communicated in advance to the Manager and the Department of Prevention, by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, indicating the dates of suspension and reactivation of the plants, as well as any variation in the communicated times. 1. Art. 66 (Flow Meter) For the utilities referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 95 of Delegated Decree No. 44/2012, a flow meter as referred to in Article 97, paragraph 2, shall be installed for the purpose of determining the volume of discharged wastewater. 2. The Manager, upon issuing the discharge permit, shall indicate the position in which to install the flow meter and shall formulate any requirements relating to its installation. 3. The flow meter must have the following characteristics: electromagnetic; able to withstand the chemical-physical agents of the wastewater; equipped with instrumentation for continuous data recording; prepared for sealing; CE marking. 4. The meter is installed according to the manufacturer's technical specifications. 5. The Manager, having verified the conditions of paragraphs 2, 3, and 4, shall affix the seals to the meter. 6. The installation, replacement, maintenance, and/or repair of the meter are the responsibility and expense of the discharge holder, who is also required to promptly report any malfunction found to the Manager. The holder is required to eliminate any condition that prejudices the correct functioning of the flow meter. 7. The user is required to allow access for reading, by locating the meter's display in an easily accessible position, also arranging whatever is necessary for connection via telemetry. 8. The technical requirements of the meter are shown in Annex O to this Regulation. 1. Art. 67 (General Requirements for Internal Works) The internal works within the settlement to be connected are carried out at the care and expense of the discharge holder in compliance with current building and hygiene regulations and the requirements or rules of other Bodies or Authorities when issuing permits. 2. Types of connections to sewerage networks are shown in Annex F to this Regulation. 1. Art. 68 (Maintenance of Connections) Maintenance interventions on the internal networks, including the connection manhole, are the responsibility of the discharge holder, and in particular the cleaning of the pipes, the trap, and the connection manhole. 2. The discharge holder is also responsible for any damage caused to the property of third parties due to the condition of their own sewerage network and/or works for its construction or maintenance. 3. Should the Manager find malfunctions or leaks in the users' internal networks, it shall require them to restore normal operation. CHAPTER VI RULES FOR THE TREATMENT OF DOMESTIC WASTEWATER FOR DISCHARGE ONTO LAND 1. Art. 69 (Treatment of Domestic Wastewater for Discharge onto Land) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 69 of the Environmental Code, the discharge of domestic wastewater onto land is permitted based on the plant diagram in Annex P, adopting, according to the type of soil present, the following plant solutions: a) a system composed of an Imhoff tank and sub-irrigation networks for dispersion or sub-irrigation with drainage; b) a system composed of an Imhoff tank and a horizontal flow phytoremediation system or a vertical flow phytoremediation system. 2. The project for the treatment plant for discharge onto land as referred to in the preceding paragraph is drawn up based on the indications contained in this Regulation and submitted to the Building Office together with the building project or, in the case of an existing sewer discharge, according to the times set out in Article 79, paragraph 3-quater of Delegated Decree No. 44/2012. The Manager shall issue an opinion as prescribed by Article 126 of Law No. 140/2017. 1. Art. 70 (Imhoff Tank) The Imhoff tank is mandatory for the treatment of domestic wastewater discharged onto land. 2. The Imhoff tank precedes the sub-irrigation or phytoremediation network; for over 50 P.E., an oxidative phase with a BOD5 reduction of not less than 60% is included. 3. The Imhoff tank must have a minimum capacity of 250 liters per P.E., of which: - 50 liters for the sedimentation compartment; - 200 liters for the digestion compartment. 4. The Imhoff tank must be inspectable and, as far as possible, located outside the perimeter walls of the building, far (at least 10 meters) from wells, tanks, and water pipes, in order to allow for the operations of residue extraction and cleaning at least annually. An inspection manhole is provided for before the Imhoff tank. 5. Water from kitchen sinks and dishwashers is treated with a grease trap before being discharged into the Imhoff tank. 6. Stormwater must not be discharged into the Imhoff tank. 1. Art. 71 (Dispersion Sub-irrigation Networks) The dispersion sub-irrigation system is normally used for permeable soils. 2. Discharge by dispersion sub-irrigation onto land is permitted for discharges from single- or two-family residential buildings and from buildings intended for civil habitation. 3. For settlements with a higher potential, such as condominiums, schools, hotels, restaurants, and small residential nuclei, the sub-irrigation discharge system is permitted only in cases where: a) the technical impossibility of discharging into surface water bodies has been ascertained; b) for building types with a consistency of less than 50 P.E. 4. Wastewater from the Imhoff tank and grease traps is discharged, through a sealed pipe, into the dispersion network. 5. The dispersion network consists of pipes made of terracotta, stoneware, concrete, or plastic materials with a diameter of 100-120 mm, laid with a slope between 0.2% and 0.5%, equipped with slots made at the bottom and perpendicular to the axis of the pipe, spaced 200–400 mm apart and 10 to 20 mm wide. The network is placed in a trench at a depth of not less than 600 mm and not more than 800 mm and with a width at the base of at least 400 mm. The bottom of the trench, for at least 300 mm, is occupied by a bed of washed gravel of size 40/70 mm. The dispersion network is placed in the center of the gravel bed. The upper part of the gravel mass, before being covered with the excavated soil, is protected with a layer of suitable material that prevents it from being clogged by the overlying soil and, at the same time, ensures the aeration of the drainage system. When the work is completed, the top of the trench must be raised with respect to the adjacent ground to avoid the formation of depressions above it. The trench may have the dispersion network in a single line, a single line with branches, or multiple lines; the trench follows the contour lines to maintain the dispersion pipe at a suitable slope. 6. For hygienic-sanitary and functional reasons, the trenches with dispersion networks are located far from buildings (about 10 meters), paved areas, or other arrangements that prevent the passage of air into the soil. The distance between the bottom of the trench and the maximum water table level must not be less than one meter; the water table cannot be used downstream for domestic use or for irrigating products to be eaten raw, unless chemical and microbiological tests are carried out by the health unit. 7. The length of the dispersion network, to be determined preferably with percolation tests, must be a function of the nature of the soil, specifically: a) fine sand, light backfill material: 2 m per P.E.; b) coarse sand and gravel: 3 m per P.E.; c) fine sand with clay: 5 m per P.E.; d) clay with some sand: 10 m per P.E.; e) compact clay: not suitable. The soil characteristics are documented by a geological report. 8. There must be a minimum distance of 30 meters between the trench and any pipe, tank, or other work intended for water service. The minimum distance between the trench and wells, pipes, tanks, or other public works intended for water service is 200 meters. 9. The user must periodically check: a) the absence of clogging of the gravel or the underlying soil; b) the absence of surface waterlogging; c) the proper functioning of the trap regularly. 10. The sub-irrigation networks can be served by a lifting system with hydraulic pumps. 1. Art. 72 (Sub-irrigation Networks with Drainage) The system of sub-irrigation networks with drainage is normally used for impermeable soils. Wastewater from clarification, through sealed pipes, flows into the dispersion pipe. The system consists of a trench, generally 1-1.5 meters deep, with a layer of clay at the bottom, on which the drainage pipe is laid, topped vertically with fine and coarse gravel; within the last layer, the dispersion network is placed. The two pipes, generally having a slope between 0.2% and 0.5%, are made of tubular elements of terracotta, stoneware, or concrete with a diameter of about 100-120 mm with straight-cut ends spaced 10 to 20 mm apart, covered on top by tiles or stone elements to prevent the entry of gravel and excavated soil, which will cover the trench with suitable material to avoid depressions; precautions must be taken so that the backfill soil does not fill the voids before settling. Aeration pipes of a suitable diameter are placed vertically, from the ground level down to the lower layer of coarse gravel, arranged alternately to the right and left of the pipes and spaced two to four meters apart. The drainage pipe opens into a suitable receptor (stream, channel, gully, etc.), while the dispersion pipe is closed 5 meters before the outlet of the drainage pipe. The trench can have pipes in a single line, a branched line, or multiple lines. The length of the pipes is generally calculated at two to four meters per user. 2. There must be a minimum distance of 30 meters between the trench and any pipe, tank, or other work intended for water service. The minimum distance between the trench and wells, pipes, tanks, or other public works intended for water service is 200 meters. 3. The sub-irrigation networks can be served by a lifting system with hydraulic pumps. 1. Art. 73 (Phytoremediation) For isolated settlements, installations, or buildings that discharge domestic or comparable wastewater, the use of natural purification technologies such as phytoremediation, or other systems that achieve the same level of environmental protection, is permitted. 2. Phytoremediation systems are distinguished into: a) sub-surface horizontal flow; b) sub-surface vertical flow. 3. The choice of the horizontal flow system is recommended for settlements with a maximum potential of 15 P.E., while the vertical flow system is recommended for a maximum of 100 P.E. 1. Art. 74 (Horizontal Flow Phytoremediation) In horizontal flow phytoremediation, the absorption bed consists of a watertight tank or basin made of masonry, concrete, or prefabricated plastic material, with a perfectly level bottom, placed at a depth of about 700/800 mm. 2. The tank or basin is filled with a layer of washed gravel, size 40/70 mm, for a thickness of 150/200 mm, to facilitate the distribution of the wastewater, and then a layer of washed fine gravel, size 10/20 mm, with a thickness of 15 mm, as a support for the roots. Above the fine gravel layer, a sheet of "non-woven fabric" is placed, and 400/500 mm of a mixture consisting of 50% topsoil and 50% peat, on which the plants will be planted. 3. Depending on the sizing of the absorption bed, there may be either an outflow of wastewater from the system or no discharge due to the complete elimination of wastewater through evaporation and plant transpiration. A surface area of the absorption bed of about 5 sq m per P.E. can be indicated to ensure complete elimination of the wastewater. Upstream of the absorption bed and in any case downstream of the Imhoff tank, a manhole is placed to control the water level in the system. Downstream of the absorption bed, a manhole is placed which will be used to control the water level in the basin, if the system is a closed circuit, and as an official sampling manhole if the system provides for discharge. 1. Art. 75 (Vertical Flow Phytoremediation) Vertical flow phytoremediation requires, downstream of the tank, an accumulation tank equipped with a lift pump to regulate the inlet flow rate. The tank, used both as a substrate for planting and as a filter, must have appropriate slopes to facilitate the discharge of the treated wastewater. The tank can be made of cast-in-place concrete, prefabricated concrete, or synthetic membranes (geomembranes) of adequate thickness, which must be protected against rupture by placing layers of "non-woven fabric" below and above. At the bottom of the tank, the collection pipe is placed, consisting of a perforated drain-type pipe that collects the purified water. This pipe conveys the purified water into a manhole, located at the outlet of the tank, where a water level regulation system (siphon) is placed to prevent water stagnation within the system. Inside the tank is the filling material, consisting of fine washed gravel with a grain size of 4/8 mm, for a height of about 1 m. Above this drainage layer, the supply pipes are laid, 1 m apart from each other, consisting of PVC or polyethylene pipes with a diameter of 100/120 mm, on which holes are made. The pipes are covered with a further layer of fine washed gravel, for a thickness of 100/150 mm. The plants are planted in this layer of gravel. When forming the final leveling of the tank, it is advisable to construct small perimeter banks to prevent the entry of stormwater. 2. For the sizing of the tank surface, from 2.5 sq m to 3.5 sq m per P.E. should be provided. TITLE IV COMMON PROVISIONS CHAPTER I FINAL PROVISIONS 1.
