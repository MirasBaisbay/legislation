CHAPTER I – PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION

Section I: Purpose

Article 1

Water is a precious resource. Its sustainable management is a national imperative.

The purpose of water management, in compliance with the environment and the priorities defined by law, is:

to ensure the supply of drinking water to the population;

to satisfy or reconcile the requirements of agriculture, livestock farming, fishing and aquaculture, the extraction of mineral substances, industry, energy production, transport, tourism, leisure, as well as all other legally practiced human activities;

to preserve and restore water quality;

to protect aquatic ecosystems;

to address the needs of health, public sanitation, civil security, and the problems posed by floods and droughts.

Article 2

The law recognizes the right of everyone to have access to water corresponding to their needs and the basic requirements of their life and dignity.

The Minister in charge of water, the Minister in charge of social affairs, and the Minister in charge of health shall propose and implement, in compliance with their respective powers, and in conjunction with other competent public authorities and private persons involved in the water sector, the necessary measures for the exercise of this right.

Article 3

Water management takes into consideration, in their entirety and their reciprocal relationships, the scientific data and the solidarities of all kinds that characterize hydrographic basins.

Article 4

The biological diversity of aquatic ecosystems, their role in the regulation and renewal of water resources, and the importance of the social, economic, and cultural functions in which they participate, confer upon their conservation a priority and a matter of general interest.

In the exercise of their respective powers, public law entities are required, as are private persons, to take into consideration the requirements of the sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems.

Section II: Scope of application

Article 5

Water is an element of the common heritage of the Nation. It is part of the public domain.

Law No. 002-2001/AN of February 8, 2001, on the framework for water management
2

Article 6

Subject to the provisions of Article 8 below, the public water domain includes water in its various physical states and geomorphological situations, as well as public works assigned to or necessary for its management. Included under this title are:

watercourses;

natural or artificial lakes, ponds, marshes, and generally, bodies of water;

areas where the presence of water, without being permanent, is regular and directly prevents or conditions its use for agricultural purposes;

groundwater;

atmospheric water;

springs, wells, boreholes, drinking troughs, and other water points assigned to public use or a public service, as well as their immediate protection perimeters, delimited in application of Article 34, paragraph 1;

dikes, dams, weirs, locks, and their dependencies or ancillary works;

irrigation, sanitation, and drainage canals;

aqueducts, pipelines, diversions, and water conduits; reservoirs, drinking water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants, and, in general, hydraulic works assigned to public use or a public service, as well as the installations and lands on which they depend.

Article 7

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 6 above, water collected in a private structure and intended for domestic use is not part of the public domain.

The same applies to swimming pools, ponds, cisterns, and ornamental pools built or developed by private persons on private property.

Article 8

In the case of watercourses, the public domain includes the bed, identified by the presence of water or apparent traces resulting from the flow of water; the banks, up to the limit reached by the water before overflowing, and the freeboards.

The freeboards consist of the land within a delimited strip on either side of the banks.

Law No. 002-2001/AN of February 8, 2001, on the framework for water management

Article 9

The watercourses and bodies of water mentioned in Article 6, paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, are entered into a nomenclature established by decree issued by the Council of Ministers after a public inquiry conducted under the authority of the Minister in charge of water.

Article 10

Joint orders of the Ministers respectively in charge of water, public lands, and health, issued after a public inquiry conducted under the authority of the Minister in charge of water and in accordance with a procedure fixed by decree issued by the Council of Ministers, shall determine the boundaries of the dependencies of the public water domain, and in particular:

watercourses and their freeboards;

bodies of water mentioned in Article 6, paragraphs 2 and 3;

immediate protection perimeters mentioned in Article 6, paragraph 6;

works and lands mentioned in Article 6, paragraphs 7, 8, and 9.

Article 11

Decrees issued by the Council of Ministers shall determine the terms of compensation for owners and other holders of land rights who have suffered direct, material, and certain prejudice due to the classification of their lands among the dependencies of the public water domain following a modification of the latter's boundaries, whether this modification results from the provisions of this law or from an artificial or natural change in the course or regime of the waters.

The decrees mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall also establish the conditions under which persons to whom the effective application of legislative provisions relating to the public water domain would cause direct, material, and certain prejudice due to the calling into question of rights deemed acquired by reference to customary rules or prior uses may be compensated.

CHAPTER II - WATER ADMINISTRATION

Section I: Structures

Article 12

A National Water Council is hereby created under the authority of the Ministry in charge of Water. It has a consultative character.

A decree issued by the Council of Ministers shall establish its powers and regulate the modalities of its composition, organization, and functioning.

Article 13

The Ministry in charge of water is the institutional guarantor of the integrated management of water resources.

Law No. 002-2001/AN of February 8, 2001, on the framework for water management
4

Article 14

Decisions relating to water management are taken by local authorities, within the framework of the community or administrative district whose territorial scope of competence is the most restricted, provided that no consideration of general interest or related to the necessity of satisfying water needs of any kind in the best possible conditions opposes it.

Article 15

The Minister in charge of water shall ensure that the populations concerned by a hydraulic development or a water management measure receive appropriate information.
He shall organize and define the modalities of a consultation to improve water management within the framework of territorial communities and village communities.

Article 16

The Minister in charge of water shall propose to the Government, after advice from the National Water Council, all measures tending to promote the implementation of the provisions set forth in Articles 14 and 15 above.

Section II: Instruments and framework for water management

Paragraph 1: The Water Action Plan

Article 17

A Water Action Plan shall be developed under the authority of the Minister in charge of water and approved by decree issued by the Council of Ministers.

Paragraph 2: Hydrographic Basins

Article 18

The hydrographic basin is the appropriate framework for the planning and management of water resources.
The coordination of public actions and consultation are carried out therein in order to prepare and implement, under optimal conditions of rationality, the orientations and decisions taken in the water sector.

Article 19

The national territory comprises four national basins:

the Comoé basin;

the Mouhoun basin;

the Nakanbé basin;

the Niger basin.

The boundaries of the basins and sub-basins that may be attached to them are fixed by decree issued by the Council of Ministers.

Article 20

On the proposal of the Minister in charge of water, the Government shall determine by decree the structures whose establishment could be envisaged in the basins, as well as the missions and powers that will be entrusted to them for water management.

The area of competence of these structures takes into account scientific, technical, administrative, or socio-economic criteria.

Paragraph 3: Water development and management plans

Article 21

Water development and management plans fall within the competence of the State.

Water development and management plans establish, as the case may be, for a basin, a group of basins, one or more sub-basins, a portion of a watercourse, or an aquifer system, the orientations for sustainable water management.

Programs and administrative decisions in the water sector must be compatible with or made compatible with the provisions of the plan.

Article 22

The modalities of application of Articles 17 and 21 above, and in particular the provisions relating to the content, elaboration, approval, implementation, and monitoring of the Water Action Plan and the water development and management plans, are determined by decrees issued by the Council of Ministers.

CHAPTER III - WATER REGIME

Section I: Power of control and allocation

Article 23

When a severe drought or other exceptional circumstances do not allow for the satisfaction of all water needs, the Government holds, without prejudice to the measures that may be taken in application of Article 29 below, a right of control and allocation, implemented according to the modalities defined by decree issued by the Council of Ministers. It also has, by delegation, through the Minister in charge of water, the same prerogatives in a locality or a part of the territory where it proves impossible or very difficult to ensure the normal exercise of various water-consuming activities.

In all cases where control and allocation measures are taken, the water needs corresponding to the supply of populations and to the elementary conditions of life and dignity are considered priorities.

Law No. 002-2001/AN of February 8, 2001, on the framework for water management
6

Section II: Regulation of water use

Article 24

Hydraulic developments and, in general, installations, works, projects, and activities carried out by any natural or legal person, public or private, and resulting, as the case may be, in:

withdrawals of surface or groundwater, whether returned or not;

a modification of the water level or flow pattern;

discharges, flows, releases, or direct or indirect deposits, whether chronic or episodic, even if non-polluting;
are subject to authorization or declaration.

Article 25

The installations, works, projects, and activities referred to in the preceding article are subject to authorization or declaration according to their nature, their location, their importance, or the gravity of their effects on the water resource and aquatic ecosystems.

Article 26

Installations, works, projects, and activities likely to present dangers to public health and safety, to reduce the water resource, to substantially modify the level, flow pattern, or regime of the waters, or to seriously affect the quality or diversity of aquatic ecosystems, are subject to authorization.
The authorization shall specify, as necessary, the requirements imposed on the beneficiary in order to eliminate, reduce, or compensate for the dangers or impacts on water and aquatic ecosystems.

Article 27

Installations, works, projects, and activities mentioned in Article 24 of this law which do not present dangers or impacts on water or aquatic ecosystems and which do not require an authorization regime, are subject to declaration.
Installations, works, projects, and activities subject to declaration must comply with the general rules enacted to preserve the health, sanitation, safety, and quality of water and to ensure the conservation of aquatic ecosystems.

Article 28

When an installation, a structure, a project, or an activity subject to authorization or declaration is operated or carried out without authorization or without having been declared, the owner or operator incurs, independently of any penal proceedings or damages owed for civil liability, a suspension measure pronounced by the Minister in charge of water or his representative.

Article 29

Without prejudice to the measures taken in cases of exceptional circumstances provided for in Article 23 above, the Minister in charge of water may regulate or prohibit certain uses of water in order to prevent a risk of shortage, or to prevent or stop the consequences of an accident or a period of drought.

Article 30

Decrees issued by the Council of Ministers shall determine the modalities of application of the provisions and the nomenclature of installations, works, projects, and activities subject, as the case may be, to authorization or declaration, the corresponding procedures, the general rules mentioned in Article 24, paragraph 2, as well as the conditions under which the Minister in charge of water exercises the powers conferred upon him by Articles 23 and 29 above.

Section III: Water protection

Paragraph 1: Servitudes

Article 31

Private and public law servitudes that affect or have an incidence on water, its flow pattern, and its regime remain subject to the legal and regulatory provisions applicable to them.

Article 32

On the proposal of the Minister in charge of water, a decree issued by the Council of Ministers shall institute a retention servitude.

This decree shall determine the conditions under which the owners, tenants, or operators of an unbuilt plot of land may be required to temporarily retain or limit the flow of water found on or circulating through their property. It shall also establish the modalities for the eventual compensation of owners or their beneficiaries in the event that they suffer direct, material, and certain prejudice as a result of the institution of the retention servitude.

Paragraph 2: Protection of water withdrawals intended for human consumption

Article 33

To ensure the protection of water quality, the authorization for works, installations, or structures carried out for the withdrawal of surface or groundwater intended for human consumption, or the authorization for these withdrawals themselves, shall delimit around the withdrawal point an immediate protection perimeter, a close protection perimeter, and, as necessary, a distant protection perimeter.

These perimeters are also determined in the case of withdrawals subject to declaration, as soon as the withdrawn water is totally or partially intended for human consumption.

Article 34

The lands included in the immediate protection perimeter are acquired in full ownership by the State or the concession holder of the public distribution service, who are responsible for enclosing them and ensuring that they are exclusively allocated to water withdrawal and regularly maintained for this purpose.

Within the close protection perimeters, deposits, installations, and activities likely to directly or indirectly harm the quality of the water or render it unfit for human consumption are prohibited.

Law No. 002-2001/AN of February 8, 2001, on the framework for water management
8

The prohibition applies, in particular, to deposits of refuse, filth, and debris; the spreading of manure; deposits of hydrocarbons and all substances presenting risks of toxicity, notably chemical products, pesticides, and fertilizers; the drilling of wells; the extraction of mineral substances.

In addition to the immediate and close protection perimeters, the competent authority may delimit a distant protection perimeter within which the deposits, installations, and activities mentioned in the preceding paragraph may be regulated in order to prevent the pollution dangers they present for the withdrawn waters.

Article 35

The competent authority may delimit protection areas around dam reservoirs, lakes, marshes, and, in general, bodies of water intended, at least partially, for human consumption. These areas may also be established to protect groundwater recharge zones.

In addition to the prohibitions and rules enacted in Article 34 above, the act of delimitation may also regulate activities such as the watering, parking, and movement of animals, and the construction of buildings or structures for residential or other use.

Article 36

Decrees issued by the Council of Ministers shall determine the modalities of application of Articles 33 to 35, and in particular the procedures for delimiting close and distant protection areas and perimeters, including when they concern withdrawal points existing on the date of promulgation of this law, as well as the conditions under which the owners or occupants of the concerned lands may be compensated in the event that they suffer, as a result, a direct, material, and certain prejudice.

Paragraph 3: Provisions applicable to activities with an impact on the water resource

Article 37

Agricultural practices and techniques likely to have a negative impact on the hydrological cycle or water quality are prohibited.
Regulations for pastoral activities, including, where applicable, restrictions on the movement of animals, may be enacted according to the same procedure.

Article 38

A decree issued by the Council of Ministers shall determine the zones within which the construction of buildings or structures, whether for residential use or not, is prohibited or subject to the observance of special prescriptions due to the risks of harm to water quality, dangers to the population, foreseeable difficulties in water supply, or obstacles to the implementation of sanitation.

Article 39

The realization of installations, works, projects, and activities subject to authorization under Article 26 above may give rise to the preparation of an impact study to determine their effects on water and aquatic ecosystems.

In cases where the impact study is mandatory, its absence or manifest insufficiency shall lead to the refusal of the authorization.

A decree issued by the Council of Ministers shall specify the modalities of application of this article.

Section IV: Protection of aquatic ecosystems

Article 40

Works built in the bed of watercourses must maintain a minimum flow guaranteeing aquatic life and the priorities defined in Article 23 above. When they are located in watercourses frequented by migratory fish, they must also be equipped with passage facilities.

Article 41

In national parks, total or partial fauna reserves, biosphere reserves, and sanctuaries that encompass all or part of one or more aquatic ecosystems, as well as in wetlands of international importance registered on the list provided for by the Ramsar Convention of February 2, 1971, actions likely to undermine the balance of these ecosystems or affect their biological diversity are regulated and, where applicable, prohibited. This includes, in particular, uses of water leading to a modification of their level, flow pattern, or regime; the spreading for any purpose whatsoever of chemical products, particularly agricultural pesticides; the discharge of effluents or toxic substances; the dumping or flow of wastewater; and the deposit of filth or domestic or industrial waste.

The regulation or prohibition may, as necessary, apply to actions carried out or envisaged outside the protected area or wetland.

Article 42

Wetlands of international importance registered on the list provided for by the Ramsar Convention of February 12, 1971, must be provided with a management plan.

The management plan is created under the authority of the Ministries in charge of water and the environment.

Law No. 002-2001/AN of February 8, 2001, on the framework for water management
10

CHAPTER IV - REGIME OF PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE WATER SECTOR AND CONTROL OF ITS USE FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES

Article 43

In all or part of the territory of a territorial community, the State may delegate to it, under conditions it defines in accordance with the law, certain of its powers relating to the use of water.

This delegation concerns the management of the public drinking water distribution service, or the use of water for agricultural, aquacultural, pastoral, industrial, tourism, or energy production purposes.

It may also cover sanitation, understood as the treatment and disposal of wastewater and, where applicable, the disposal of rainwater.

Article 44

A public or private person who, under a contract with the State or a delegated territorial community, ensures the distribution of water, may also take charge of the sanitation service. The latter is then managed according to the same modalities as water distribution or in application of provisions specific to it.

Article 45

The State or the delegated territorial community manages the public water distribution service, itself or under its responsibility, either directly (en régie) or within the framework of a management or stewardship contract, or by way of concession or lease (affermage).

A decree issued by the Council of Ministers shall specify the management methods and their conditions of application.

Article 46

Whatever the management method chosen for water distribution and sanitation, the public or private persons in charge are subject to the general rules applicable to public services. They shall comply, in particular, with the principle of equality among users, the principle of continuity, according to which the service must function regularly and without interruption, and the principle of adaptation of the service to the evolution of collective needs and the requirements of the general interest.

They are responsible for the quality of the distributed water, for which potability standards shall be fixed by a joint order of the Ministers in charge of water and health.

Law No. 002-2001/AN of February 8, 2001, on the framework for water management
11

CHAPTER V - FINANCING OF THE WATER SECTOR

Section I: The financing system

Article 47

The use of water requires everyone to participate in the Nation's effort to ensure its management.

Those who, by their activity, make necessary or useful public or private interventions to preserve or restore water quality, to meet the needs corresponding to its uses, or to ensure the conservation of aquatic ecosystems, shall bear the cost of these interventions or contribute to their financing.

Article 48

Natural or legal persons whose activity is likely to cause or aggravate the pollution of water or the degradation of the aquatic environment shall contribute to the financing of measures that the State and public communities must take to combat this pollution, to compensate for its effects, and to ensure the conservation of aquatic ecosystems.

The contributions thus defined are proportional to the extent of the pollution or degradation in question. They may be reduced on account of the provisions taken by the liable parties to remedy them and do not exclude the benefit of public aid aimed at the same ends.

The payment of a contribution determined in application of the above provisions does not preclude the engagement of the civil or criminal liability of the liable party in the event that its activity is the source of damage or constitutes an offense.

Article 49

Natural or legal persons who use water for purposes other than domestic may be subject to the payment of a financial contribution based on the volume of water withdrawn, consumed, or mobilized; this contribution must primarily serve to finance the water sector.

The determination of the persons subject to or exempted, the activities concerned, the amount, and the administrative and accounting rules applicable to this contribution shall take into consideration the social, economic, cultural, and ecological importance of the activity in question, the revenues and profits of any kind that may result from it, as well as the collective charges it imposes, notably on the State and other public entities, in matters of water management.

The modalities of application of the preceding provisions are the subject of a decree issued by the Council of Ministers on the joint proposal of the Ministers respectively in charge of finance, water, and the Minister or Ministers whose powers correspond to the activity for which a financial contribution is envisaged.

Article 50

On the proposal of the Ministers in charge of finance and water, a decree issued by the Council of Ministers shall specify domestic uses, set their thresholds, and define, where applicable, the conditions under which certain domestic uses may be subject to a financial contribution.

Law No. 002-2001/AN of February 8, 2001, on the framework for water management

Section II: Reimbursement of expenses incurred by public entities in case of accidental pollution

Article 51

In the event of accidental water pollution, the public entities that have intervened materially or financially are entitled to reimbursement by the person or persons responsible for the accident of the investigation and expertise costs they have incurred, as well as the expenses undertaken to mitigate or prevent the aggravation of the damage. The reimbursement of the sums due is made without prejudice to the compensation for other damages.

CHAPTER VI - PENAL PROVISIONS
