PART II - PROCEDURES FOR STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (SEA), FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA), AND FOR THE INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT (IPPC)
TITLE I - GENERAL PROVISIONS
Art. 4
Content and objectives
The provisions of part two of this decree constitute the implementation of:
a) Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 27, 2001, on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, with the following objectives:
to ensure a high level of environmental protection;
to contribute to the integration of environmental considerations into the preparation, adoption, and approval phases of certain plans and programmes in order to promote sustainable development;
to promote the use of environmental assessment in the drafting of state, regional, and supra-municipal plans and programmes;
to ensure that an environmental assessment is carried out for plans and programmes that are likely to have significant effects on the environment;
b) Directive 85/337/EEC of the Council of June 27, 1985, on the assessment of the environmental impact of certain public and private projects, as amended and integrated by Council Directive 97/11/EC of March 3, 1997, and by Directive 2003/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 26, 2003, and of Directive 96/61/EC of September 24, 1996, transposed by Legislative Decree no. 59 of February 18, 2005, on integrated pollution prevention and control, with the following objectives:
to ensure the full transposition of Community directives on environmental impact assessment;
to simplify, without prejudice to the provisions of Art. 1, paragraph 2, of Law no. 443 of December 21, 2001, also through the issuance of regulations pursuant to Art. 17, paragraph 2, of Law no. 400 of August 23, 1988, the environmental impact assessment procedures, which shall take into account the cost-benefit ratio of the project from an environmental, economic, and social point of view;
to advance the environmental impact assessment procedures to the earliest configuration of the project that can be subjected to an exhaustive examination;
to introduce a system of controls capable of ascertaining effective compliance with the requirements imposed during the assessment;
to encourage public participation in the elaboration of plans and programmes on environmental matters;
to ensure the completion of procedures within certain timeframes;
to introduce coordination mechanisms between the environmental impact assessment procedure and the strategic environmental assessment procedure;
to adopt coordination measures between the environmental impact assessment procedures and those for integrated pollution prevention and control, or for the integrated environmental permit, in the case of plants subject to both procedures, in order to avoid duplication and overlaps.
Strategic environmental assessment, or simply environmental assessment, concerns plans and programmes for intervention on the territory and is aimed at ensuring that the environmental effects arising from the implementation of said plans and programmes are taken into consideration during their elaboration and before their approval.
The procedure for strategic environmental assessment constitutes, for the plans and programmes subject to such assessment, an integral part of the ordinary procedure for adoption and approval. Approval measures adopted without prior strategic environmental assessment, where required, are null and void.
Environmental impact assessment concerns projects for works and interventions which, due to their nature or size, may have a significant impact on the environment and is aimed at ensuring that the effects deriving from the construction and operation of said works and interventions on the ecosystem are taken into consideration during their planning and before the approval or authorization of the related projects, or in any case before their implementation.
The procedure for environmental impact assessment constitutes, for the projects of works and interventions subject to it, a prerequisite or an integral part of the ordinary authorization or approval procedure. Authorization or approval measures adopted without prior environmental impact assessment, where required, are null and void.

Art. 6
Technical-advisory committee for environmental assessments
By decree of the President of the Council of Ministers, on the proposal of the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, the Technical-Advisory Committee for Environmental Assessments is established at the Ministry for the Environment and Protection of the Territory. The same decree establishes the duration and the methods for the organization and functioning of the Committee itself.
The Committee provides the Ministry for the Environment and Protection of the Territory with technical-scientific support for the implementation of the provisions of part two of this decree. In particular, the Committee provides for the preliminary investigation and expresses opinions on the environmental reports and environmental impact studies relating to plans and programmes or projects respectively subject to strategic environmental assessment and environmental impact assessment of state competence, and also expresses opinions on integrated environmental permits of state competence.
The Committee is composed of seventy-eight members, in addition to the president and three vice-presidents, chosen from among university professors, professionals, and experts qualified in management systems, in measurements, and in design, geological, environmental, legal, economic, and social matters, as well as from among managers of the public administration.
The activity of the Committee is structured in three operational sectors headed by the three vice-presidents and concerning, respectively, the following procedures:
a) strategic environmental assessment;
b) environmental impact assessment;
c) integrated pollution prevention and control.
The Committee normally operates through subcommittees. The subcommittees are composed of a variable number of members depending on the professional skills necessary for the complete and adequate examination of the specific case. The identification of the necessary professional skills is the responsibility of the competent vice-president. Once the professional profiles of the members and the coordinator of the subcommittee have been identified, the individual commissioners are assigned to the subcommittees on the basis of a predefined rotation order.
Due to the specific regional interests involved in the exercise of an activity subject to the provisions of part two of this decree, the relevant subcommittee is supplemented by the expert designated by each of the regions directly affected by the activity by territory.
For the purposes of paragraph 6, the regional administrations directly affected by territory shall notify the Ministry for the Environment and Protection of the Territory of their interest.
If the administrations referred to in paragraph 7 have not provided for the designation of the experts, the subcommittee is constituted in its ordinary composition and proceeds in any case with the investigation entrusted to it, without prejudice to the possibility of its subsequent integration, in compliance with the stage of elaboration and any partial conclusions already reached.

TITLE II - STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT - SEA
CHAPTER I - COMMON PROVISIONS ON SEA
Art. 7
Scope of application
The plans and programmes referred to in paragraph 2, as well as those referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, if they are likely to have significant effects on the environment and cultural heritage, are subject to strategic environmental assessment. The modifications referred to in paragraph 5 are also subject to strategic environmental assessment.
Without prejudice to the provision of paragraph 3, the following are subject to strategic environmental assessment:
a) plans and programmes that meet both of the following requirements:
they concern the agricultural, forestry, fisheries, energy, industrial, transport, waste and water management, telecommunications, tourism, land-use planning or land use sectors;
they set the framework for the approval, authorization, location, or realization of works and interventions whose projects are subject to environmental impact assessment under current legislation;
b) plans and programmes concerning sites designated as special protection areas for the conservation of wild birds and those classified as sites of Community importance for the protection of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna.
Plans and programmes other than those referred to in paragraph 2, which set the framework for the approval, authorization, location, or realization of works and interventions whose projects, although not subject to environmental impact assessment under these provisions, may nevertheless have significant effects on the environment and cultural heritage, in the opinion of the competent subcommittee for strategic environmental assessment, are also subject to strategic environmental assessment.
The plans and programmes referred to in paragraph 2 that determine the use of small areas at a local level and the modifications of the plans and programmes referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 that have already been approved are subject to strategic environmental assessment only if they are likely to have significant effects on the environment.
For the purposes of applying paragraphs 3 and 4, the authority competent for the approval of the plan or programme must preliminarily verify whether the specific plan or programme subject to approval is likely to have significant effects on the environment according to the criteria set out in Annex II to part two of this decree. An analogous verification must be carried out when approving a modification of an already approved plan or programme.
In the examination of individual cases and in the specification of the types of plans and programmes referred to in paragraph 2, other authorities which, due to their specific environmental competences, may be interested in the environmental effects resulting from the application of the plan or programme under examination must be consulted. For plans and programmes whose approval is the responsibility of State bodies, the opinion of the committee referred to in Article 6 must in any case be obtained.
The conclusions adopted pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 6, including the reasons for not carrying out the strategic environmental assessment, must be made available to the public.
The following are in any case excluded from the scope of application of the provisions of part two of this decree:
a) plans and programmes intended exclusively for national defence purposes characterized by extreme urgency or covered by state secrecy;
b) financial or budget plans and programmes;
c) plans and programmes relating to mobile telephony interventions subject to the provisions of Art. 87 of Legislative Decree no. 259 of August 1, 2003.
Art. 8
Integration of environmental assessment in planning procedures
The strategic environmental assessment must be carried out during the preparatory phase of the plan or programme and prior to its approval in a legislative or administrative capacity.
The administrative procedures provided for in this title are integrated into the ordinary procedures in force for the adoption and approval of plans and programmes.
In the case of hierarchically ordered plans and programmes, the authorities competent for the approval of the individual plans or programmes shall take into account, in order to avoid duplication of judgment, the assessments already carried out for the approval of the higher-level plan and those to be carried out for the approval of the subordinate plans.
Art. 9
Environmental report
For plans and programmes subject to strategic environmental assessment, an environmental report must be drawn up, before and for the purposes of approval, which constitutes an integral part of the documentation of the proposed or adopted plan or programme to be approved.
The environmental report must identify, describe, and evaluate the significant effects that the implementation of the proposed plan or programme could have on the environment and cultural heritage, as well as the reasonable alternatives that can be adopted in consideration of the objectives and the territorial scope of the plan or programme itself. Annex I to part two of this decree lists the information to be provided for this purpose to the extent that it can be reasonably required, taking into account the level of knowledge and current assessment methods, the contents and level of detail of the plan or programme and, in cases of multi-level planning processes, taking into account that certain aspects are more adequately assessed in other subsequent phases of said process.
To prepare the environmental report, the information referred to in Annex I to part two of this decree concerning the environmental effects of the plan and programme under assessment may be used, which is in any case available and has also been obtained within the framework of other decision-making levels or otherwise acquired in implementation of other regulatory provisions.
The proponent has the option of initiating a preliminary phase for the purpose of defining, in consultation with the competent authority, the information to be provided in the environmental report.
Other authorities which, due to their specific environmental competences, may be interested in the environmental effects of the application of the plan or programme under examination must be consulted at the time of the decision on the scope of the information to be included in the environmental report and on its level of detail.
A non-technical summary of the contents of the proposed plan or programme and of the other data and information contained in the report itself must be attached to the environmental report.
Art. 10
Consultations
Before approval, the adopted plan or programme, or, if a formal act of adoption is not provided for, the proposal of the plan or programme and the environmental report prepared in accordance with Article 9 must be made available to the other authorities which, due to their specific environmental or landscape competences, exercise administrative functions related to the environmental effects of the application of the plan or programme, and to the public.
For the purposes of paragraph 1 and paragraph 4, the proposal of the plan or programme and the related environmental report must be sent to all the aforementioned other authorities. The non-technical summary, indicating the locations where the full documentation can be inspected, must be deposited in an adequate number of copies at the offices of the provinces and regions whose territory is even partially affected by the plan or programme or by the effects of its implementation.
The sending and deposit referred to in paragraph 2 must be announced in the press in the manner established by a specific regulation, which ensures uniform publicity criteria for all plans and programmes subject to strategic environmental assessment, guaranteeing that the public concerned is in all cases adequately informed. The same regulation establishes the cases and methods for the simultaneous total or partial publication on the internet of the proposal of the plan or programme and the related environmental report. The regulation must be issued by decree of the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory within ninety days from the date of entry into force of part two of this decree. Until the entry into force of the regulation, publications must be carried out at the care and expense of the interested party in a national newspaper and in a regional newspaper for each directly interested region.
Within a period of forty-five days from the publication of the notice of deposit and any publication on the internet pursuant to paragraph 3, anyone with an interest may inspect the proposal of the plan or programme and the related environmental report deposited and publicized in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2, and 3. Within the same period, anyone may submit their own observations, including by providing new or further cognitive and evaluative elements.
The deposits and publications, referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, with the connected and consequent consultations, referred to in paragraph 4, replace for all purposes all forms of information and participation possibly provided for by the ordinary procedures for the adoption and approval of the same plans or programmes.
Art. 11
Transboundary consultations
Where the implementation of a specific plan or programme subject to strategic environmental assessment is likely to have significant effects on the environment of another Member State of the European Union, or where the Member State that is likely to be significantly affected so requests, a full copy of the proposal of the plan or programme and the environmental report, prepared in accordance with Article 9, must be transmitted, before the approval of the plan or programme, also to said interested Member State, inviting it to express its opinion within a period of sixty days from the receipt of the transmitted documentation.
Where the Member State, to which a copy of the proposal of the plan or programme and the environmental report has been transmitted pursuant to paragraph 1, communicates within thirty days of receipt that, in order to express its opinion, it intends to proceed with consultations, the competent authority must grant a suitable period, in any case not exceeding ninety days, to allow the Member State to proceed with consultations with its own internal authorities and the public concerned. In the meantime, any other deadline is suspended.
Art. 12
Environmental compatibility judgment and approval of the proposed plan or programme
Before the approval of the plan or programme subject to strategic environmental assessment, the environmental report prepared pursuant to Article 9, the opinions expressed pursuant to Article 10, as well as any opinions of other Member States rendered pursuant to Article 11, must be examined and evaluated.
Based on the results of the examination and evaluations referred to in paragraph 1, the authority responsible for the environmental assessment, within sixty days from the expiry of the last deadline for the submission of opinions under Articles 10 and 11, shall issue the environmental compatibility judgment containing a detailed and reasoned environmental opinion which constitutes a prerequisite for the continuation of the procedure for the approval of the plan or programme. The environmental compatibility judgment may be conditional on the adoption of specific modifications and integrations to the proposal of the evaluated plan or programme. In such cases, the judgment is transmitted to the proponent with an invitation to make the necessary changes before resubmitting the plan or programme for approval. The expiration of the term referred to in this paragraph without action implies the exercise of substitutive power by the Council of Ministers, which shall act within sixty days, after formal notice to the competent body to comply within a period of twenty days, also at the request of the interested parties.
In the absence thereof, for plans and programmes subject to environmental assessment at the state level, a negative judgment on the environmental compatibility of the presented plan or programme is deemed to have been issued. For plans and programmes subject to environmental assessment at a non-state level, the provisions of the preceding period apply until the entry into force of specific regional and autonomous province regulations, to be adopted in compliance with the relevant Community discipline in force.
The approval of the plan or programme shall take into account the opinion referred to in paragraph 2. To this end, the approval measure must be accompanied by a summary statement illustrating how environmental considerations have been integrated into the plan or programme and how the environmental report prepared pursuant to Article 9, the opinions expressed pursuant to Article 10, and the results of the consultations initiated pursuant to Article 11 have been taken into account, as well as the reasons for which the adopted plan or programme was chosen, also with respect to the possible alternatives that had been identified, and, finally, the measures adopted regarding monitoring.
If, during the investigation for the approval of a plan or programme to be subjected to strategic environmental assessment pursuant to Article 7, it is found that the relevant procedure has not been initiated, the authority competent for the approval of said plan or programme shall formally invite the proponent to initiate said procedure and simultaneously suspend the approval procedure.
Art. 13
Information about the decision
The environmental compatibility judgments and the approval measures referred to, respectively, in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 12 must be made available to the public, together with the related documentation, by the proponent, who is required to give notice thereof in the press according to the methods established by the regulation referred to in Article 10, paragraph 3.
The same environmental compatibility judgments and approval measures are transmitted in full copy by the competent authority to the other authorities and to the Member States that have participated in the consultations referred to in Articles 10 and 11.
Art. 14
Monitoring
The authorities responsible for the approval of plans or programmes shall, using the system of Environmental Agencies, monitor the significant environmental effects of the implementation of the approved plans and programmes, in order, among other things, to identify at an early stage unforeseen negative effects and to be able to adopt appropriate corrective measures.
To comply with the provision of paragraph 1, existing control mechanisms must be used, as far as possible, in order to avoid duplication of monitoring.
The corrective measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be notified to the public by means of the press according to the methods established by the regulation referred to in Article 10, paragraph 3.
CHAPTER II - SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR SEA AT THE STATE LEVEL
Art. 15
Plans and programmes subject to SEA at the state level
Plans and programmes referred to in Article 7 whose approval is the responsibility of State bodies are subject to strategic environmental assessment at the state level.
For the environmental assessment of the plans and programmes referred to in paragraph 1, the provisions of this chapter supplement and specify the provisions of Chapter I; the latter also apply to the assessment of the projects referred to in paragraph 1 where not otherwise provided for in this Chapter II.
Art. 16
Initiation of the procedure

For the plans and programmes referred to in Article 15, before the initiation of the approval procedure, pursuant to Article 10, paragraphs 1 and 2, an adequate number of copies of the non-technical summary must be deposited at the offices of the provinces and regions whose territory is even partially affected by the plan or programme or by the effects of its implementation; a full copy of the proposal of the plan or programme and the environmental report must also be sent to the regions.
Notice of the deposits and submissions must be published in the manner provided for in Article 10, paragraph 3.
In the phases referred to in Articles 19 and 20, if carried out, and in any case at the start of the investigation, due to the specific characteristics of the proposed plan or programme and also at the request of the proponent, specific and different methods of publication and information may be established, as appropriate, supplementing or simplifying those referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3. If such modifications are ordered during the investigation and involve the renewal of the press notice referred to in paragraph 3, all deadlines of the procedure are interrupted and restart from the publication of the new announcement.
Art. 17
Investigation and adoption of the environmental compatibility judgment
The technical-investigative activities for the strategic environmental assessment of plans and programmes whose approval is the responsibility of State bodies are carried out by the Committee referred to in Article 6. To this end, the competent vice-president, for each proposal of a plan or programme sent to him pursuant to Article 16, paragraph 1, provides for the establishment of a specific subcommittee according to the criteria of Article 6, paragraph 5; where the conditions are met, the subcommittee is supplemented pursuant to paragraph 6 of the same Article 6.
If the subcommittee verifies the incompleteness of the submitted documentation, it may request its integration. In this case, the deadlines of the procedure remain suspended until the receipt of the requested integrations.
The appointed subcommittee acquires and evaluates all the submitted documentation, as well as the observations, objections, and suggestions forwarded pursuant to Articles 10 and 11, and expresses its reasoned opinion within a period of thirty days from the expiry of all the deadlines referred to in Articles 10 and 11, without prejudice to any suspension ordered pursuant to paragraph 2.
In case of delay, and after formal notice to act within ten days, also at the request of the interested parties, all the powers of the vice-presidents are exercised by the President of the Committee.
The opinion expressed by the subcommittee is immediately transmitted by the competent vice-president to the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, who, in concert with the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities and with the proposing Minister, within the following thirty days, provides for the adoption of the environmental compatibility judgment.
The expiration of the term referred to in paragraph 5 without action implies the exercise of substitutive power by the Council of Ministers, pursuant to and with the effects of Article 12, paragraph 2.
Art. 18
Effects of the environmental compatibility judgment
The proposals of plans and programmes subject to strategic environmental assessment, even if they have already been adopted with a formal act, are reviewed and, if necessary, reformulated, on the basis of the environmental compatibility judgment rendered pursuant to Article 17.
For the purposes of the provisions of Article 4, paragraph 3, the environmental compatibility judgment is in any case attached to the plan or programme submitted for approval.
For the purposes of the approval of the plan or programme, Article 12, paragraph 3, applies.
Art. 19
Screening procedure
Plans and programmes other than those referred to in Article 7, paragraph 2, but which nevertheless concern the agricultural, forestry, fisheries, energy, industrial, transport, waste and water management, telecommunications, tourism, land-use planning or land use sectors, as well as modifications to said plans and programmes, are subject to a screening procedure in order to ascertain whether the conditions of paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the same Article 7 are met.
The screening is carried out by the authority competent for the approval of the plans or programmes, at the request of the proponent and having acquired the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 6, which shall decide, based on the criteria of Annex II to part two of this decree, within thirty days of the request. To this end, the screening request, together with the proposal of the plan or programme and its related attached documents, must be forwarded in copy to said Committee to allow the timely establishment of the subcommittee responsible for expressing the opinion. In case of a positive outcome, the investigation referred to in Article 17 is also assigned to the appointed subcommittee; moreover, taking into account the specific characteristics of the proposed plan or programme, the information methods may be simultaneously specified, also in derogation of the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 16.
If, during the investigation for the approval of a new plan or programme, or of a modification to an already approved plan or programme, it is found that the screening procedure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has not been carried out, such procedure is initiated by the authority competent for the approval, which, to this end, transmits to the Committee referred to in Article 6 all the useful documentation in its possession and simultaneously suspends the approval procedure.
Art. 20
Scoping phase
For plans and programmes subject to strategic environmental assessment at the state level, the scoping phase referred to in Article 9, paragraph 4, takes place in consultation between the proponent and the Committee referred to in Article 6.
For the purposes of paragraph 1, the interested proponent has the option to directly request the competent vice-president to establish, according to the criteria of Article 6, paragraphs 5 and 6, a specific subcommittee with which to interact.
At the end of the scoping phase, the appointed subcommittee, having heard the territorially interested regions pursuant to and for the effects of Article 9, paragraph 5, drafts a report indicating precisely all the information that must be included in the environmental report and its relative level of detail. With the same report, taking into account the specific characteristics of the proposed plan or programme, the information methods may be specified, also in derogation of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 16.
The subcommittee appointed for the scoping phase is also responsible for the investigation referred to in Article 17.

Art. 23
Scope of application
The following are subject to the environmental impact assessment procedure:
a) projects listed in list A of Annex III to part two of this decree, wherever located;
b) projects listed in list B of Annex III to part two of this decree that fall, even partially, within protected natural areas as defined by Law no. 394 of December 6, 1991;
c) projects listed in list B of Annex III to part two of this decree that do not fall within protected natural areas, but which, based on the elements indicated in Annex IV to part two of this decree, in the opinion of the competent authority, nevertheless require the environmental impact assessment procedure to be carried out;
d) projects for specific works or interventions for which the environmental impact assessment procedure is expressly required by special sector-specific laws governing said works or interventions.
For projects of works or interventions referred to in paragraph 1, letter a), located within protected natural areas, the dimensional thresholds, where provided, are reduced by fifty percent.
The same procedure also applies to interventions on existing works not falling within the categories of paragraph 1, if such interventions result in a work that falls into those same categories. It also applies to substantial modifications of works and interventions falling within the categories of paragraph 1, letters a) and b).
The following projects may be excluded from the scope of application of this title which, in the opinion of the competent authority, do not require the environmental impact assessment procedure to be carried out:
a) projects related to works and interventions intended exclusively for national defence purposes;
b) projects related to works and interventions intended exclusively for civil protection purposes, or ordered in situations of necessity and urgency for the purpose of safeguarding human life from imminent danger or in response to disasters;
c) projects related to works of a temporary nature, including those exclusively necessary for the execution of authorized remediation interventions.
For the projects referred to in paragraph 1, letter c), and paragraph 4, letters a), b), and c), the screening procedure referred to in Article 32 applies. During this screening procedure, for the projects referred to in paragraph 4, the competent authority shall communicate to the European Commission, before granting any exemption, the reasons justifying such an exemption pursuant to Art. 2, paragraph 3, letter c), of Directive 85/337/EEC.
For the purposes of the application of Art. 4 of Legislative Decree no. 13 of January 17, 2005, for airport projects subject to the environmental impact assessment procedure pursuant to part two of this decree, such procedure shall take into account the requirements defined in ANNEX 2 of the same Legislative Decree no. 13 of January 17, 2005.
In the case of works and interventions of extreme urgency intended exclusively for national defence as per paragraph 4, letter a), the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory shall, on the proposal of the Minister of Defence, grant an exemption from any environmental compatibility verification only for projects related to works covered by state secrecy.
Art. 24
Objectives of the EIA
The environmental impact assessment procedure must ensure that:
a) in the decision-making processes concerning the realization of projects identified in the Annexes to part two of this decree, the objectives of protecting health and improving the quality of human life are considered, in order to contribute with a better environment to the quality of life, provide for the maintenance of species diversity and preserve the reproductive capacity of the ecosystem as an essential life resource, as well as the objectives of ensuring the multiple use of natural resources, of public goods intended for collective enjoyment, and of ensuring sustainable development;
b) for each project, the direct and indirect effects of its realization on humans, fauna, flora, soil, surface and groundwater, air, climate, landscape, and the interaction between these factors, on material assets, and on cultural and environmental heritage are evaluated;
c) for each project, the main reasons for the choice among the alternatives proposed by the developer are made explicit;
d) at every stage of the procedure, the exchange of information and consultation between the proponent and the competent authority are guaranteed;
e) public information and participation in the procedure are guaranteed;
f) the simplification, rationalization, and coordination of assessments and authorizations in environmental matters are achieved.
Art. 25
Jurisdiction and procedures
The environmental impact assessment is the responsibility of:
a) for projects of works and interventions subject to state authorization and for those with interregional or international environmental impact, the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, in concert with the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities, according to the provisions of this Chapter I and Chapter II;
b) in other cases, the authority identified by the region or autonomous province by its own law, taking into account the attributions of competence for the issuance of the authorization for the realization of the various works and interventions and according to the procedures established by the same, on the basis of the guiding criteria of Chapter III of this title, without prejudice to the common provisions of this Chapter I.
Art. 26
Initiation of the procedure
The developer or proponent of the work or intervention must submit a specific application to the competent authority, enclosing the project, the environmental impact study, and the non-technical summary.
A full copy of the application referred to in paragraph 1 and its annexes must be transmitted to the interested regions, provinces, and municipalities and, in the case of protected natural areas, also to their respective managing bodies, which must express their opinion within sixty days of receiving the application. After this period has elapsed, the competent authority shall issue the environmental compatibility judgment even in the absence of said opinions.
Due to the specific dimensional and functional characteristics of the planned work or intervention, or due to the number of potentially interested local authorities and the size of the project's documentation and related environmental impact study, the developer or proponent, by initiating a specific preliminary phase for this purpose, may request to be fully or partially exempted from the obligations under paragraph 2, or to be authorized to adopt other appropriate disclosure systems.
Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 29, paragraph 5, in case of acceptance of opinions, observations, or findings, any integrations to the submitted study or to the attached documentation may be requested, with an indication of a reasonable deadline for the response, or submitted by the developer or proponent, on a single occasion. In such cases, all deadlines of the procedure are interrupted and restart from the date of receipt of the supplementary documentation. If the interested party does not comply, the assessment shall not proceed further. The developer or proponent has the option to submit a new application.
Art. 27
Environmental impact study
The environmental impact study is prepared at the care and expense of the developer or proponent, according to the indications in Annex V to part two of this decree.
For projects subject to environmental impact assessment, the developer or proponent has the option, before initiating the environmental impact assessment procedure, to request the competent authority to carry out a preliminary phase for the purpose of defining, in consultation with said authority, the information, including that in Annex V to part two of this decree, that must be contained in the environmental impact study. To this end, the developer or proponent submits a report which, based on the identification of the expected environmental impacts, defines the work plan for the preparation of the environmental impact study, the methodologies it intends to adopt for the elaboration of the information contained therein, and its relative level of detail. The competent authority, even if said opinion has been rendered, may request the developer or proponent, after the initiation of the environmental impact assessment procedure, for clarifications and integrations regarding the submitted documentation.
Other authorities which, due to their specific environmental competences, may be interested in the environmental effects of the realization and operation of the planned work or intervention must be consulted, at the time of the decision, on the scope of the information to be included in the environmental impact study and on its level of detail.
The requested information must be consistent with the necessary level of detail and strictly relevant to the specific characteristics of a certain type of project and the components of the environment likely to be affected, also in relation to the location of the intervention, taking into account available knowledge and assessment methods. If the developer or proponent believes that certain information should not be disclosed for reasons of business or personal confidentiality, protection of intellectual property, public security, or national defence, they may produce, along with the complete version, a version of the environmental impact study devoid of said information. The competent authority, having assessed the reasons for confidentiality provided by the proponent, may order that the consultation of the environmental impact study by the public concerned be limited to this version.
The environmental impact study must in any case contain at least the following information:
a) a description of the project with information on its characteristics, location, and dimensions;
b) a description of the measures planned to avoid, reduce, and possibly offset significant negative effects;
c) the data necessary to identify and assess the main effects on the environment and cultural heritage that the project may produce, both in the construction and operational phases;
d) a summary description of the main alternatives examined by the developer, including the so-called "zero option," with an indication of the main reasons for the choice, from the perspective of environmental impact;
e) an assessment of the cost-benefit ratio of the project from an environmental, economic, and social point of view.
A non-technical summary of the dimensional and functional characteristics of the planned work or intervention and of the data and information contained in the study itself must be attached to the environmental impact study.
For the purposes of preparing the study, the public or private entity interested in the realization of the works or plants has the right to access the information and data available at the offices of public administrations.
Art. 28
Publicity measures
The administrations of the State, the regions, and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano shall ensure the identification of the offices where, on a permanent or case-by-case basis, the documents and acts relating to the assessment procedures, pending or concluded, concerning works and interventions relevant to their respective powers and competences, are deposited and can be consulted by the public.
Simultaneously with the submission of the application referred to in Article 26, the developer or proponent shall, at their own expense:
a) deposit the project of the work, the environmental impact study, and an adequate number of copies of the non-technical summary at the offices identified, pursuant to paragraph 1, by the State administrations, the regions, and the interested autonomous provinces;
b) disseminate a press announcement of the deposit, according to the methods established by the competent authority with a specific regulation that ensures uniform publicity criteria for all projects subject to environmental impact assessment, guaranteeing that the public concerned is in all cases adequately informed. The same regulation establishes the cases and methods for the simultaneous total or partial publication of the project on the internet. The regulation must be issued by decree of the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory within ninety days from the date of entry into force of part two of this decree. Until the entry into force of the regulation, publications shall be carried out at the care and expense of the interested party in a national newspaper and in a regional newspaper for each directly interested region.
Appeals against the decisions, acts, or omissions subject to the provisions on public participation established by Title III of part two of this decree are always admissible according to the general rules on challenging illegal administrative acts.
Art. 29
Participation in the procedure
The interested party who intends to provide cognitive and evaluative elements concerning the possible effects of the planned work or intervention may submit written observations on said project, subject to the environmental impact assessment procedure, to the competent authority within a period of forty-five days from the publication referred to in Article 28, paragraph 2, letter b). The environmental compatibility judgment shall consider, simultaneously, individually or in groups, such observations, the opinions provided by public administrations, and any other observations from the public.
The competent authority for the environmental impact assessment may order a public inquiry to examine the study presented by the developer or proponent, the opinions provided by public administrations, and the observations of the public.
The inquiry referred to in paragraph 2 suspends the deadline referred to in Article 31, paragraph 1, and concludes within the sixtieth day from the one on which it was initiated, regardless of the stage reached by the planned operations. Within the same period, the competent authority shall draft a report on the work carried out and a judgment on the results that have emerged, which are acquired and evaluated for the purposes of the judgment referred to in Article 31.
The developer or proponent, if the inquiry referred to in paragraph 2 does not take place, may, also at their own request, be summoned by the competent authority, before the conclusion of the procedure, for a summary adversarial hearing with the parties who have submitted opinions or observations. The record of the adversarial hearing is acquired and evaluated for the purposes of the judgment referred to in Article 31.
When the developer or proponent intends to conform, in whole or in part, the project to the opinions or observations, or to the findings that emerged during the public inquiry or the adversarial hearing, they shall make a request to the competent authority, indicating the necessary time. The request suspends all deadlines of the procedure, which resume their course with the deposit of the modified project.
Art. 30
Technical investigation
The technical investigation of the projects referred to in Article 23 has the following objectives:
a) to ascertain the completeness of the submitted documentation;
b) to verify the correspondence of the description of the places and their environmental characteristics with those documented by the proponent;
c) to verify that the project data, concerning the production and management of liquid and solid waste, polluting emissions into the atmosphere, noise, and any other potential source of pollution, correspond to the requirements dictated by the sector regulations;
d) to ascertain the coherence of the project, concerning the construction techniques and the planned production processes, with the data on the use of raw materials and natural resources;
e) to ascertain the correct use of analysis and forecasting tools, as well as the suitability of the detection and forecasting techniques employed by the proponent in relation to the environmental effects;
f) to identify and describe the overall impact of the project's realization on the environment and cultural heritage, also in relation to the final quality levels, comparing the existing situation at the time of the communication with the forecast of the subsequent one.

Art. 31
Environmental compatibility judgment
The environmental impact assessment procedure must conclude with a reasoned judgment within ninety days from the publication referred to in Article 28, paragraph 2, letter b), except in cases of interruption and suspension expressly provided for.
The expiration of the term referred to in paragraph 1 without action, calculated taking into account any interruptions and suspensions that have occurred, implies the exercise of substitutive power by the Council of Ministers, which shall act within sixty days, after formal notice to the competent body to comply within a period of twenty days, also at the request of the interested parties. In the absence thereof, for projects subject to environmental impact assessment at the state level, a negative judgment on the environmental compatibility of the project is deemed to have been issued. For projects subject to environmental impact assessment at a non-state level, the provisions of the preceding period apply until the entry into force of specific regional and autonomous province regulations, to be adopted in compliance with the relevant Community discipline in force.
The administration competent for the final authorization for the realization of the work or the planned intervention shall acquire the environmental compatibility judgment, including any requirements for the mitigation of impacts, the monitoring of the works and plants, and the measures planned to avoid, reduce, or possibly offset significant negative effects. In the case of initiatives promoted by public authorities, the final measure authorizing their realization must adequately demonstrate the conformity of the choices made with the outcomes of the environmental impact procedure. In other cases, the projects must be adapted to the outcomes of the environmental compatibility judgment before the issuance of the authorization for realization.
The outcomes of the environmental impact assessment procedure must be communicated to the parties to the procedure, to all competent public administrations, including in matters of environmental controls, and must be adequately publicized. In particular, the information made available to the public includes: the content of the decision and any conditions attached to it; the main reasons and considerations on which the decision is based, taking into account the requests and opinions of the public, as well as information on the public participation process; a description, where necessary, of the main measures prescribed in order to avoid, reduce, and if possible, offset the most significant negative effects.
Art. 32
Screening procedure
For the projects referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1, letter c), and paragraph 4, letters a), b), and c), the developer or proponent shall first request the screening provided for therein from the competent authority. The information that the developer or proponent must provide for said screening concerns a description of the project and the data necessary to identify and assess the main effects that the project may have on the environment.
If the competent authority deems that the project must be subject to environmental impact assessment, Articles 26 and following shall apply.
The competent authority must rule within sixty days from the date of the application, identifying any requirements for the mitigation of impacts and for the monitoring of the works or plants; the remedies provided for by current legislation are available against administrative silence. The Ministry for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, the regions, and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano shall ensure that the list of projects for which screening has been requested and their respective outcomes are made public.
Art. 33
Relations between SEA and EIA
For projects of works and interventions to be carried out in implementation of plans or programmes that have already been subject to strategic environmental assessment, and which fall within the categories for which environmental impact assessment is required, all elements positively evaluated during the strategic assessment or in any case decided during the approval of the plan or programme shall constitute acquired data during the execution of the latter assessment.
Art. 34
Relations between EIA and IPPC
For works and interventions subject to environmental impact assessment and simultaneously falling within the scope of application of Legislative Decree no. 59 of February 18, 2005, as well as for substantial modifications, according to the definition in Article 5, paragraph 1, letter g), of such works or interventions, the proponent has the option to obtain that the environmental impact assessment procedure be integrated into the procedure for the issuance of the integrated environmental permit.

The modifications planned for plants subject to the discipline laid down by Legislative Decree no. 59 of February 18, 2005, which pursuant to Art. 10 of said legislative decree are not found to be substantial, do not constitute substantial modifications for the purposes of the provisions of part two of this decree.
For thermal power plants with a capacity exceeding 300 MW, as well as for substantial modifications to them, according to the definition in Article 5, paragraph 1, letter g), the environmental impact assessment procedure is integrated into the procedure for the issuance of the integrated environmental permit. Paragraph 2 of this article applies, with the exception of the provision in letter c).
Modifications to electricity production plants and related connected works, which are also subject to the discipline of Legislative Decree no. 59 of February 18, 2005, and which constitute mere implementations of requirements contained in the integrated environmental permit and in the authorization referred to in Art. 1, paragraph 1, of Decree-Law no. 7 of February 7, 2002, converted, with amendments, by Law no. 55 of April 9, 2002, are not considered substantial modifications for the purposes of part two of this decree and are to be included in the relevant authorization measures.
CHAPTER II - SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR EIA AT THE STATE LEVEL
Art. 35
Projects subject to EIA at the state level
The environmental impact assessment of projects for works and interventions falling into the categories of Article 23 is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, in concert with the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities, having consulted the interested region and based on the investigation carried out by the Technical-Advisory Committee referred to in Article 6, in cases where it concerns:
a) works or interventions subject to authorization for construction or operation by State bodies;
b) works or interventions located in the territory of more than one region or which may in any case have significant impacts on more than one region;
c) works or interventions that may have significant effects on the environment of another Member State of the European Union.
For the environmental impact assessment of the projects referred to in paragraph 1, the provisions of this Chapter II supplement and specify the provisions of Chapter I; the latter also apply to the assessment of the projects referred to in paragraph 1 where not otherwise provided for in this Chapter II.
Art. 36
Assessment procedure
Pursuant to and for the purposes of Article 26, paragraphs 1 and 2, the projects for the works and interventions referred to in Article 35 must be submitted to the Ministry for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, to the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities, to the territorially interested region, to the Technical-Advisory Committee for Environmental Assessments referred to in Article 6, and to any other interested Ministries. The environmental impact study referred to in Article 27 and its related non-technical summary must be attached to the project. If the planned work or intervention affects more than one region, a copy of the project, to which the environmental impact study referred to in Article 27 and its related non-technical summary are attached, must be sent to each region.
For works and interventions that fall within the territory of multiple local authorities, only the extract of the project and the environmental impact study relating to the portion of the work or intervention that affects the relevant territorial area may be deposited with each province and each municipality, without prejudice to the deposit of the non-technical summary in its full version. The same possibility is permitted with regard to protected natural areas and their respective managing bodies.
The option for the developer or proponent to request in advance from the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory the definition, pursuant to Article 26, paragraph 3, of more adequate and practicable disclosure methods in relation to the specific characteristics of the project remains unaffected. With the same methods, at the express request of the developer or proponent, the communications and deposits to be made for the reopening before the Ministry for the Environment and Protection of the Territory of the procedure originally initiated at the regional or provincial level, and for which the authority designated by the region or autonomous province has declared itself incompetent pursuant to Article 42, paragraph 3, can be defined.
The interested regions, provinces, and municipalities must express their opinion within sixty days from the date of the transmission referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. After this period has elapsed, the compatibility judgment may be issued even in the absence of said opinions.
Without prejudice to the provisions of the regulation referred to in Article 28, paragraph 2, letter b), the announcement of the submission must in any case be published, at the care of the developer or proponent, at least in a national newspaper and in a regional newspaper for each territorially interested region.
Anyone with an interest, pursuant to the laws in force, may submit to the Ministry for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, or directly to the Technical-Advisory Committee referred to in Article 6, and to the interested region, written petitions, observations, or opinions on the work subject to environmental impact assessment, within a period of thirty days from the publication of the project's communication.
The Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, based on the investigation carried out pursuant to Article 37, shall rule on the environmental compatibility, in concert with the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities and with the proposing Minister, within ninety days from the date of the last of the publications referred to in paragraph 5, and in any case not before sixty days have elapsed from the last of the transmissions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, subject to extension decided by the Council of Ministers in cases of particular importance.
The expiration of the terms referred to in paragraph 7 without action, calculated taking into account any interruptions and suspensions that have occurred, implies the exercise of substitutive power by the Council of Ministers, which shall act pursuant to and with the effects of Article 31, paragraph 2.
For the works referred to in paragraph 1, letter a), of Article 35, the Minister competent for their realization, if he does not deem it appropriate to conform the proposed project to the compatibility judgment of the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, may propose with justification to the President of the Council of Ministers the adoption of a measure to review said judgment, or order the non-realization of the project. The Council of Ministers shall decide on the review proposal within the terms and with the effects referred to in paragraph 8 of this article.

Art. 37
Investigative tasks of the technical-advisory committee
The technical-investigative activities for the environmental assessment of projects for works and interventions of State competence are carried out by the Committee referred to in Article 6. To this end, the competent vice-president, for each project sent to him pursuant to Article 26, paragraph 1, provides for the establishment of a specific subcommittee according to the criteria of Article 6, paragraph 5; where the conditions are met, the subcommittee is supplemented pursuant to paragraph 6 of the same Article 6. This paragraph does not apply to the plants governed by paragraphs 8, 9, 10, and 11.
If the subcommittee verifies the incompleteness of the submitted documentation, it may request its integration. In this case, the time limits of the procedure remain suspended until the receipt of the requested integrations. If the interested party fails to provide the requested integrations within the following thirty days, or within the different period specified in the integration request itself in consideration of the possible difficulty in producing certain information, the procedure is archived. The developer or proponent in any case has the option to submit a new application.
The appointed subcommittee acquires and evaluates all the submitted documentation, as well as the observations, objections, and suggestions forwarded pursuant to Articles 36, paragraphs 4 and 6, and 39, and expresses its reasoned opinion within a period of thirty days from the expiry of all the deadlines referred to in the aforementioned Articles 36, paragraphs 4 and 6, and 39, without prejudice to any suspension ordered pursuant to paragraph 2.
The opinion issued by the subcommittee is transmitted, within ten days of its recording, by the competent vice-president to the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, for the adoption of the environmental compatibility judgment pursuant to paragraph 7 of Article 36.
In cases where, based on the prescribed approval procedures, the environmental impact assessment is carried out on preliminary projects, the subcommittee also has the task of verifying the compliance of the final project with the requirements of the environmental compatibility judgment and of carrying out the appropriate checks in this regard.
If, during the verifications referred to in paragraph 5, it is ascertained that the final project differs from the preliminary one with regard to the areas concerned or the environmental resources involved, or in any case that it is significantly different from it, the subcommittee shall transmit a specific report to the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, who shall adopt the measures relating to the updating of the environmental impact study and order its new publication, also for the purpose of sending observations by the interested public and private parties.
For the purpose of carrying out the tasks referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6, the proponent is required, under penalty of forfeiture of the authorization for the realization of the project or the enabling title for the transformation of the territory, to transmit the final project to the competent subcommittee before the start of the work's realization.
Art. 38
Scoping phase and screening
For the projects referred to in Article 35, the technical-advisory Committee referred to in Article 6 also provides for the investigation for the scoping and possible screening phases, referred to, respectively, in Articles 26, paragraph 3, 27, paragraph 2, 32, and 36, paragraph 3.
For the purposes of paragraph 1, the relevant requests are addressed directly to the vice-president of the Committee competent for the matter, who provides for the establishment, according to the criteria of Article 6, paragraphs 5 and 6, of the subcommittees to which the relevant investigations are assigned.
The subcommittee established for the scoping phase related to a specific project then also provides for the investigation referred to in Article 37 related to the same project. The same applies to the subcommittee established for the screening in case of a positive outcome of said preliminary procedure.
Art. 39
Procedures for projects with transboundary environmental impacts
If the planned work or intervention is likely to have significant effects on the environment of another Member State of the European Union, or if the Member State that could be significantly involved so requests, at least the following must be transmitted to the same State:
a) a description of the project accompanied by all available information about its possible transboundary impact;
b) information on the nature of the decision that may be taken.
If the Member State, to which the information referred to in paragraph 1 has been sent, communicates within the following thirty days that it intends to participate in the ongoing assessment procedure, a copy of the developer's or proponent's application, the project of the work or intervention, the environmental impact study, and the non-technical summary must be transmitted to the same State, if this has not already been done.
With the transmission of the documentation referred to in paragraph 2, a period of thirty days is assigned to the interested State to submit any observations, unless said State has adopted the decision to express its opinion after consultation with its own competent authorities and the public concerned, in which case a suitable period, in any case not exceeding ninety days, is assigned.
More detailed arrangements for the implementation of this article may be agreed upon on a case-by-case basis with the interested Member State, without prejudice to the provision of adequate conditions for public participation in the decision-making procedures.
Pending the deadlines referred to in paragraph 3, any other deadline of the procedure remains suspended.
Art. 40
Effects of the environmental compatibility judgment
The outcomes of the environmental impact assessment procedure must be communicated to the parties to the procedure, to all competent public administrations, including in matters of environmental controls, and must be adequately publicized. In particular, the information made available to the public includes: the content of the decision and any conditions attached to it; the main reasons and considerations on which the decision is based, taking into account the requests and opinions of the public, as well as information on the public participation process; a description, where necessary, of the main measures prescribed in order to avoid, reduce, and if possible, offset the most significant negative effects.
The environmental compatibility judgment, including any requirements for the mitigation of impacts and the monitoring of the works and plants, must, in particular, be acquired by the authority competent for issuing the final authorization for the realization of the planned work or intervention.
In the case of initiatives promoted by public authorities, the final measure authorizing their realization must adequately demonstrate the conformity of the choices made with the outcomes of the environmental impact procedure. In other cases, the projects must be adapted to the outcomes of the environmental compatibility judgment before the issuance of the authorization for realization.
In the case of works not realized at least for twenty percent within three years from the environmental compatibility judgment, the procedure must be reopened to assess whether the information regarding the territory and the state of the resources has undergone significant changes in the meantime. In any case, the environmental compatibility judgment ceases to be effective upon the completion of the fifth year from its issuance.
Art. 41
Subsequent checks
If, during the execution of the works referred to in Article 35, the Committee referred to in Article 6 identifies situations that conflict with the judgment expressed on the environmental compatibility of the project, or behaviors that conflict with the requirements related to it or are otherwise such as to compromise fundamental needs of ecological and environmental balance, it shall promptly communicate this to the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, who, having carried out the appropriate verifications, shall order the suspension of the works and issue the necessary prescriptions for the restoration of the environmental compatibility conditions of the works themselves.

CHAPTER II - THE INSTRUMENTS
Art. 65
Value, purpose and contents of the district basin plan
The district basin plan, hereinafter Basin Plan, has the value of a sectoral territorial plan and is the cognitive, normative, and technical-operational instrument through which actions and use regulations aimed at the conservation, protection, and enhancement of the soil and the correct use of waters are planned and programmed, on the basis of the physical and environmental characteristics of the affected territory.
The Basin Plan is drawn up by the Basin Authority based on the guidelines, methods, and criteria established pursuant to paragraph 3. Studies and interventions are conducted with particular reference to mountain basins, high valley torrents, and valley-bottom watercourses.
The Basin Plan, in conformity with the guidelines, methods, and criteria established by the Permanent Institutional Conference referred to in Article 63, paragraph 4, achieves the purposes indicated in Article 56 and, in particular, contains, together with the elements referred to in Annex 4 to the third part of this decree:
a) the organized and updated cognitive framework of the physical system, of the land uses provided for by the municipal and inter-municipal urban planning instruments, as well as of the constraints, relating to the district, referred to in Legislative Decree No. 42 of January 22, 2004;
b) the identification and quantification of the situations, both existing and potential, of degradation of the physical system, as well as their relative causes;
c) the directives to which the soil protection, hydrogeological and hydraulic arrangement, and the use of waters and soils must conform;
d) the indication of the necessary works distinguished by function:
of the dangers of flooding and the gravity and extent of the instability;
of the dangers of drought;
of the dangers of landslides, earth movements and similar;
of the pursuit of the objectives of social and economic development or of territorial rebalancing as well as the time necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the interventions;
e) the programming and use of water, agricultural, forestry, and extractive resources;
f) the identification of prescriptions, constraints, and hydraulic, hydraulic-agricultural, hydraulic-forestry, afforestation, hydraulic reclamation, stabilization, and consolidation works of the land and any other action or rule of use or constraint aimed at the conservation of the soil and the protection of the environment;
g) the continuation and completion of the works indicated in letter f), if they have already been undertaken with allocations provided for by special laws, by ordinary laws, or following the approval of the relative programming acts;
h) the protection, consolidation, and arrangement works of the marine coasts that subtend the hydrographic district;
i) the reward mechanisms in favor of the owners of agricultural and wooded areas who implement interventions suitable to prevent phenomena of hydrogeological instability;
l) the preventive evaluation, also for the purpose of choosing between different governance and management hypotheses, of the cost-benefit ratio, of the environmental impact and of the financial resources for the main planned interventions;
m) the regulations and interventions aimed at regulating the extraction of lithoid materials from the fluvial, lacustrine, and maritime state property and the relative buffer zones, specifically identified according to the good regime of the waters and the protection of the geostatic and geomorphological balance of the land and the coasts;
n) the indication of the zones to be subjected to special constraints and prescriptions in relation to the specific hydrogeological conditions, for the purposes of soil conservation, the protection of the environment and the prevention against presumed harmful effects of anthropic interventions;
o) the measures to combat the phenomena of subsidence and desertification, also through programs and interventions useful to guarantee greater availability of the water resource and its reuse;
p) the cognitive survey of the diversions in progress with specification of the energy, drinking water, irrigation or other purposes and of the flow rates;
q) the survey of different uses for fishing, navigation or other;
r) the plan of possible future uses both for diversions and for other purposes, distinguished by type of use and according to the quantity;
s) the priorities of the interventions and their organic development over time, in relation to the severity of the instability;
t) the indication of the financial resources provided for by current legislation.
The provisions of the approved Basin Plan are immediately binding for public administrations and bodies, as well as for private subjects, where it is a matter of prescriptions declared to be of such effectiveness by the Basin Plan itself. In particular, the socio-economic development plans and programs and of land use and planning must be coordinated, or in any case not in conflict, with the approved Basin Plan.
For the purposes of paragraph 4, within twelve months of the approval of the Basin Plan, the competent authorities shall adapt their respective territorial plans and regional programs such as, in particular, those relating to agricultural, zootechnical, and agroforestry activities, to the protection of the quality of waters, to waste management, to the protection of environmental assets, and to land reclamation.
Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 4, the regions, within ninety days from the date of publication of the Basin Plan in their respective regional Official Bulletins, shall issue, where necessary, the provisions concerning the implementation of the plan itself in the urban planning sector. Once this term has passed, the territorial entities interested by the Basin Plan are in any case required to respect its prescriptions in the urban planning sector. If the aforementioned entities do not provide for the adoption of the necessary fulfilments relating to their urban planning instruments within six months from the date of communication of the aforementioned provisions, and in any case within nine months from the publication of the approval of the Basin Plan, the regions shall provide for the adjustment ex officio.
Pending the approval of the Basin Plan, the Basin Authorities adopt safeguard measures with particular reference to mountain basins, high valley torrents, and valley-bottom watercourses and to the contents of letters b), c), f), m) and n) of paragraph 3. The safeguard measures are immediately binding and remain in force until the approval of the Basin Plan and in any case for a period not exceeding three years. In case of non-implementation or non-observance, by the regions, provinces, and municipalities, of the safeguard measures, and if a serious damage to the territory may derive from this, the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, after a warning to comply within a suitable term to be indicated in the same warning, adopts with a cautionary order the necessary provisional safeguard measures, also with inhibitory effect of works, or of anthropic activities, giving prior communication to the competent administrations. If the non-implementation or non-observance referred to in this paragraph concerns a peripheral office of the State, the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea informs without delay the competent Minister on whom the office depends, who takes the necessary measures to ensure compliance. If the need for a cautionary intervention remains to avoid serious damage to the territory, the competent Minister, in concert with the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, adopts the cautionary order referred to in this paragraph.
The basin plans can be drawn up and approved also for sub-basins or for sectoral excerpts, which, in any case, must constitute sequential and interrelated phases with respect to the contents of paragraph 3. The systemic consideration of the territory must in any case be guaranteed and the appropriate inhibitory and cautionary measures must be disposed, pursuant to paragraph 7, in relation to the aspects not yet completely regulated.
The implementation of this article must not give rise to new or greater charges for public finance.
Art. 66
Adoption and approval of basin plans
The basin plans, before their approval, are subjected to strategic environmental assessment (SEA) at the state level, according to the procedure provided for by the second part of this decree.
The Basin Plan, accompanied by the relative environmental report for the purposes of paragraph 1, is adopted by a majority by the Permanent Institutional Conference referred to in Article 63, paragraph 4, which, with its own deliberation, simultaneously establishes:
a) the terms for the adoption by the regions of the consequent provisions;
b) which components of the plan constitute the exclusive interest of the single regions and which constitute common interests to two or more regions.
The Basin Plan, accompanied by the relative environmental report referred to in paragraph 2, is sent to the components of the Permanent Institutional Conference at least twenty days before the date set for the conference; in case of a majority decision, the deliberation of adoption must provide an adequate and analytical motivation with respect to the dissenting opinions expressed during the conference.
In case of inertia regarding regional fulfilments, the President of the Council of Ministers, on the proposal of the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, after a warning to comply within a suitable term and having heard the interested region, takes the necessary measures, including the appointment of an "ad acta" commissioner, to guarantee in any case the carrying out of the procedures and the adoption of the necessary acts for the formation of the plan.
Notice of the adoption of the plan is given in the forms and with the methods provided for by the second part of this decree for the purposes of carrying out the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) procedure at the state level.
Once the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) procedure is concluded, on the basis of the judgment of environmental compatibility expressed by the competent authority, the basin plans are approved by decree of the President of the Council of Ministers, with the methods referred to in Article 57, paragraph 1, letter a), number 2), and are then published in the Official Gazette and in the Official Bulletins of the territorially competent regions.
The Basin Authorities promote the active participation of all interested parties in the elaboration, review, and updating of the basin plans, providing so that, for each hydrographic district, the following documents are published and made available for possible observations from the public, including users, granting a minimum period of six months for the presentation of written observations:
a) the calendar and the work program for the presentation of the plan, including a declaration of the consultative measures that must be taken at least three years before the beginning of the period to which the plan refers;
b) a provisional global assessment of the main water management problems, identified in the hydrographic basin at least two years before the beginning of the period to which the plan refers;
c) copies of the draft basin plan, at least one year before the beginning of the period to which the plan refers.
Art. 67
Sectoral plans for the protection from hydrogeological risk and prevention measures for risk areas
Pending the approval of the basin plans, the Basin Authorities adopt, pursuant to Article 65, paragraph 8, district sectoral plans for the hydrogeological structure (PAI), which contain in particular the identification of the areas at hydrogeological risk, the perimeter of the areas to be subjected to safeguard measures, and the determination of the same measures.
The Basin Authorities, also in derogation of the procedures of Article 66, also approve extraordinary plans aimed at removing the situations of highest hydrogeological risk, drawn up also on the basis of the proposals of the regions and local authorities. The extraordinary plans must primarily include the areas at hydrogeological risk for which a state of emergency has been declared, pursuant to Article 5 of Law No. 225 of February 24, 1992. The extraordinary plans contain in particular the identification and the perimeter of the areas at very high hydrogeological risk for the safety of persons and for the security of infrastructures and of the environmental and cultural heritage. For these areas, safeguard measures are adopted pursuant to Article 65, paragraph 7, also with reference to the contents of paragraph 3, letter d), of the same Article 65. In case of inertia on the part of the Basin Authorities, the President of the Council of Ministers, on the proposal of the Committee of Ministers, referred to in Article 57, paragraph 2, adopts the acts relating to the identification, perimeter, and safeguarding of the aforementioned areas. If the safeguard measures are adopted in the absence of the sectoral plans referred to in paragraph 1, they remain in force until the approval of said plans. The approved extraordinary plans can be integrated and modified with the same methods as in this paragraph, in particular with reference to the interventions carried out for the purpose of making the interested areas safe.
The Committee of Ministers referred to in Article 57, paragraph 2, taking into account the programs already adopted by the Basin Authorities and the extraordinary plans of paragraph 2 of this article, defines, in agreement with the State-Regions Conference, programs of urgent interventions, also through maintenance actions of the hydrographic districts, for the reduction of hydrogeological risk in the areas where the greater vulnerability of the territory is connected with higher dangers for people, things, and the environmental heritage, with priority for the areas where a state of emergency has been declared, pursuant to Article 5 of Law No. 225 of February 24, 1992. For the realization of the interventions, the ordinances referred to in Article 5, paragraph 2, of Law No. 225 of February 24, 1992, may be adopted, on the proposal of the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea and the Minister of Infrastructures and Transport, and in agreement with the interested regions.
For the preliminary activity relating to the fulfilments of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, the competent Ministers avail themselves, without new or greater charges for public finance, of the Department of Civil Protection, as well as of the collaboration of the State Forestry Corps, of the regions, of the Basin Authorities, of the National Group for the Defense from Hydrogeological Disasters of the National Research Council and, for environmental aspects, of the Geological Survey of Italy - Soil Protection Department of the Agency for Environmental Protection and for Technical Services (APAT), for their respective competencies.
Within six months from the adoption of the measures referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4, the civil protection bodies provide for the preparation, for the areas at hydrogeological risk, with priority assigned to those in which the greater vulnerability of the territory is connected with higher dangers for people, things, and the environmental heritage, of urgent emergency plans containing measures for the safeguarding of the safety of the interested populations, including early warning, alarm, and preventive rescue.
The sectoral plans referred to in paragraph 1 identify the infrastructures and the artifacts that determine the hydrogeological risk. On the basis of these identifications, the regions establish the incentive measures to which the proprietary subjects can access in order to adapt the infrastructures and to relocate the productive activities and private dwellings outside the risk area. To this end, the regions, having acquired the opinion of the interested local authorities, prepare, with priority criteria connected to the level of risk, a plan for the adaptation of the infrastructures, also determining a suitable term, and for the granting of financial incentives for the relocation of productive activities and private dwellings built in conformity with the urban planning-building regulations or condoned. The incentives are activated within the limits of the share of funds received pursuant to Article 86, paragraph 2, of Legislative Decree No. 112 of March 31, 1998, and also concern the costs for the demolition of the artifacts; the resulting land is acquired into the non-disposable heritage of the municipalities. The demolition of the artifacts is carried out with the methods provided for by the current regulations. If the interested subjects do not avail themselves of the faculty to use the aforementioned incentives, they shall forfeit any benefits connected to the damages deriving to their settlements as a consequence of the occurrence of natural disasters.
The acts referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of this article must contain the indication of the means for their realization and the relative financial coverage.

Art. 68
Procedure for the adoption of sectoral plan projects
The projects of the sectoral plan for the protection from hydrogeological risk, referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 67, are not subject to strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and are adopted with the methods of Article 66.
The adoption of the sectoral plans for the hydrogeological structure must take place, on the basis of the available acts and opinions, within and no later than six months from the date of adoption of the relative plan project.
For the purposes of the adoption and implementation of the sectoral plans and the necessary coherence between district planning and territorial planning, the regions convene a programmatic conference, articulated by provincial sections, or by another territorial area deliberated by the regions themselves, in which the interested provinces and municipalities participate, together with the region and a representative of the Basin Authority.
The conference referred to in paragraph 3 expresses an opinion on the plan project with particular reference to the integration on a provincial and municipal scale of the contents of the plan, providing for the necessary hydrogeological and urban planning prescriptions.
CHAPTER III - THE INTERVENTIONS
Art. 69
Intervention programs
The basin plans are implemented through three-year intervention programs that are drawn up taking into account the guidelines and purposes of the plans themselves and contain the indication of the means to face them and the relative financial coverage.
The three-year programs must allocate a share of not less than fifteen percent of the total allocations to:
a) ordinary maintenance interventions of the works, plants, and assets, including means, equipment, and materials of the workshop-sites and hydraulic warehouses;
b) carrying out the service of hydraulic police, inland navigation, flood, and prompt hydraulic intervention;
c) compilation and updating of basin plans, carrying out of studies, surveys or other in matters concerning soil protection, drafting of general projects, feasibility studies, projects of works, and environmental impact assessment studies of the main works.
The regions, having obtained the favorable opinion of the Permanent Institutional Conference referred to in Article 63, paragraph 4, may provide with their own allocations for the realization of works and interventions provided for by the basin plans, under the control of the aforementioned conference.
The provinces, the municipalities, the mountain communities, and the other public bodies, with the prior authorization of the Permanent Institutional Conference referred to in Article 63, paragraph 4, may contribute with their own allocations to the realization of works and interventions provided for by the basin plans.
Art. 70
Adoption of the programs
The intervention programs are adopted by the Permanent Institutional Conference referred to in Article 63, paragraph 4; these programs are sent to the components of the conference itself at least twenty days before the date set for the conference; in case of a majority decision, the deliberation of adoption must provide an adequate and analytical motivation with respect to the dissenting opinions expressed within the conference.
The deadline of each three-year program is set at December 31 of the last year of the three-year period and the sums authorized for the implementation of the program for the part possibly not yet committed at the aforementioned date are intended to increase the fund of the subsequent three-year program for the implementation of the interventions provided for by the current three-year program or its revision.
By December 31 of the penultimate year of the current three-year program, the new intervention programs relating to the subsequent three-year period, adopted according to the methods of paragraph 1, are transmitted to the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, so that, by the following June 3, on the basis of the forecasts contained in the programs and having heard the State-Regions Conference, he may transmit to the Minister of Economy and Finance the indication of the financial need for the subsequent three-year period, for the purposes of preparing the draft financial law.

Art. 71
Implementation of interventions
The study and design and technical-organizational functions attributed to the Basin Authorities can also be exercised through the assignment of tasks to university institutions, freelance professionals, or specialized technical-professional organizations, in conformity with specific directives issued by the Permanent Institutional Conference referred to in Article 63, paragraph 4.
The execution of prompt intervention works can have a definitive character when the urgency of the case requires it.
All concession acts for the implementation of interventions pursuant to this section are subject to registration at a fixed rate.
Art. 72
Financing
Without prejudice to the revenues connected with the maintenance and operation activities of hydraulic, reclamation, and land improvement works, the interventions provided for by this section are entirely borne by the State and are implemented through the three-year programs of Article 69.
For the purposes of paragraph 1, provision is made pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 3, letter d), of Law No. 468 of August 5, 1978. The aforementioned allocations are entered in the budget forecast of the Ministry of Economy and Finance until the completion of the allocation procedure of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article, on the basis of which the Minister of Economy and Finance makes, with his own decree, the necessary budget variations.
The Committee of Ministers referred to in Article 57, after hearing the State-Regions Conference, prepares the draft national intervention program for the three-year period and the allocation of funds between the State Administrations and the regions, taking into account the priorities indicated in the individual programs and ensuring, where necessary, the coordination of the interventions. Against the total authorized allocation, the same Committee of Ministers proposes the amount of a reserve quota to be allocated to the financing of the programs for the functional, technical, and scientific adaptation and enhancement of the Agency for Environmental Protection and for Technical Services (APAT).
The national intervention program and the allocation of funds, including the reserve quota in favor of the Agency for Environmental Protection and for Technical Services (APAT), are approved by the President of the Council of Ministers, pursuant to Article 57.

Art. 75
Competencies
In the matters regulated by the provisions of this section:
a) the State exercises the competencies assigned to it for the protection of the environment and the ecosystem through the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, without prejudice to the competencies in hygienic-sanitary matters assigned to the Minister of Health;
b) the regions and local authorities exercise the functions and tasks assigned to them within the framework of their constitutionally determined competencies and in compliance with state attributions.
With reference to the functions and tasks assigned to the regions and local authorities, in case of ascertained inactivity that involves non-fulfillment of the obligations deriving from membership of the European Union, danger of serious prejudice to health or the environment, or non-compliance with information obligations, the President of the Council of Ministers, on the proposal of the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea for the matter, assigns the defaulting entity a suitable term to provide, after which, if it has passed uselessly, the Council of Ministers, having heard the defaulting subject, appoints a commissioner who provides in a substitute capacity. The economic charges connected with the substitution activity are borne by the defaulting entity. The ordinance powers provided for by the legal system in case of urgent necessity and the provisions on substitute powers provided for by current legislation, as well as the provisions of Article 132, remain firm.
The technical prescriptions necessary for the implementation of the third part of this decree are established in the Annexes to the decree itself and with one or more regulations adopted pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, of Law No. 400 of August 23, 1988, on the proposal of the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea after agreement with the State-Regions Conference; through the same regulations, the Annexes to the third part of this decree can also be modified to adapt them to subsequent needs or to new scientific or technological acquisitions.
By decree of the competent Ministers for the matter, provision is made for the modification of the Annexes to the third part of this decree to give effect to the directives that will be issued by the European Union, for the parts in which they modify executive and technical order characteristics of the European Union directives implemented by the third part of this decree, according to what is provided for by Article 13 of Law No. 11 of February 4, 2005.
The regions ensure the widest dissemination of information on the state of water quality and transmit to the Department for the protection of inland and marine waters of the Agency for Environmental Protection and for Technical Services (APAT) the cognitive data and information relating to the implementation of the third part of this decree, as well as those prescribed by community discipline, according to the methods indicated by decree of the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, in concert with the competent Ministers, in agreement with the permanent Conference for relations between the State, the regions and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano. The Department for the protection of inland and marine waters of the Agency for Environmental Protection and for Technical Services (APAT) processes at a national level, within the National Environmental Information System (SINA), the information received and transmits it to the interested Ministries and to the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea also for sending to the European Commission. With the same decree, the cases in which the regions are required to transmit to the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea the measures adopted for the purposes of communications to the European Union or by reason of assumed international obligations are identified and regulated.
The regions favor the active participation of all interested parties in the implementation of the third part of this decree, in particular in the phase of elaboration, revision, and updating of the protection plans of Article 121.
The regions provide so that the quality objectives of Articles 76 and 77 and the relative programs of measures are pursued in the water bodies falling within the international hydrographic basins in implementation of agreements between the interested member states, availing themselves for this purpose of existing structures resulting from international agreements.
If the hydrographic district exceeds the borders of the European Community, the State and the regions exercise their own competencies by working to establish an adequate coordination with the third countries involved, in order to achieve the objectives of the third part of this decree throughout the hydrographic district.
The land reclamation and irrigation consortia, also through specific program agreements with the competent authorities, contribute to the realization of actions of environmental safeguarding and restoration of waters also for the purpose of their irrigation use, the renaturalization of watercourses and phytodepuration.
TITLE II - QUALITY OBJECTIVES
CHAPTER I - ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OBJECTIVE AND QUALITY OBJECTIVE FOR SPECIFIC DESTINATION
Art. 76
General provisions
For the purpose of the protection and remediation of surface and groundwater, the third part of this decree identifies the minimum environmental quality objectives for significant water bodies and the quality objectives for specific destination for the water bodies referred to in Article 78, to be guaranteed throughout the national territory.
The environmental quality objective is defined as a function of the capacity of water bodies to maintain the natural processes of self-purification and to support ample and well-diversified animal and plant communities.
The quality objective for specific destination identifies the state of the water bodies suitable for a particular use by man, for the life of fish and mollusks.
In implementation of the third part of this decree, measures are adopted, through the water protection plan of Article 121, to achieve the following objectives by December 22, 2015;
a) that the environmental quality objective corresponding to the "good" state be maintained or achieved for significant surface and groundwater bodies;
b) that the "high" state of environmental quality, as defined in Annex 1 to the third part of this decree, be maintained where it already exists;
c) that the quality objectives for specific destination of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree, except for the terms of fulfillment provided for by the previous regulations, also be maintained or achieved for the water bodies for specific destination referred to in Article 79.
If for a water body environmental quality objectives and for specific destination are designated that provide for different limit values for the same parameters, the most cautious ones must be respected when they refer to the achievement of the environmental quality objective; the obligation to respect these values starts from December 22, 2015.
The protection plan provides for the coordination of environmental quality objectives with the various quality objectives for specific destination.
The regions can define higher environmental quality objectives, as well as identify further destinations of water bodies and related quality objectives.
Art. 77
Identification and pursuit of the environmental quality objective
Within twelve months from the date of entry into force of the third part of this decree, on the basis of the data already acquired and the results of the first survey carried out pursuant to Articles 118 and 120, the regions that have not done so identify for each significant water body, or part of it, the quality class corresponding to one of those indicated in Annex 1 to the third part of this decree.
In relation to the classification of paragraph 1, the regions establish and adopt the necessary measures for the achievement or maintenance of the environmental quality objectives of Article 76, paragraph 4, letters a) and b), taking into account the maximum admissible load, where fixed on the basis of the indications of the Basin Authorities, and ensuring in any case for all water bodies the adoption of measures suitable to prevent further degradation.
In order to ensure by December 22, 2015, the achievement of the environmental quality objective corresponding to the "good" state, by December 31, 2008, each classified surface water body or stretch thereof must achieve at least the requirements of the "sufficient" state of Annex 1 to the third part of this decree.
The waters falling within the protected areas must comply with the objectives and quality standards set in Annex 1 to the third part of this decree, according to the time schedules established therein, unless otherwise provided by the sector legislation under which the individual areas were established.
The designation of an artificial or heavily modified water body and the relative motivation are explicitly mentioned in the basin plans and are reviewed every six years. The regions can define an artificial or heavily modified water body when:
a) the modifications of the hydromorphological characteristics of that body, necessary for the achievement of a good ecological status, have significant negative consequences:
on the environment in a broad sense;
on navigation, including port infrastructures, or on leisure boating;
on activities for which water is accumulated, such as the supply of drinking water, the production of energy, or irrigation;
on water regulation, protection from floods, or agricultural drainage;
on other sustainable human development activities equally important;
b) the advantages for which the artificial or modified characteristics of the water body are intended cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or due to disproportionate costs, be achieved with other means that represent a significantly better option on the environmental plan.
The regions can with reason establish different terms for water bodies that present conditions such as not to allow the achievement of the "good" state by December 22, 2015, in compliance with what is established in paragraph 9 and provided that at least one of the following reasons exists:
a) the scope of the necessary improvements can be implemented, for reasons of technical feasibility, only in phases that exceed the established period;
b) the completion of the improvements within the established terms would be disproportionately expensive;
c) the natural conditions do not allow improvements in the state of the water body in the required times.
The regions can with reason establish less stringent environmental quality objectives for certain water bodies, if at least one of the following conditions occurs:
a) the water body has undergone, as a consequence of human activity, serious repercussions that make a significant improvement of the qualitative state manifestly impossible or economically unsustainable;
b) the achievement of the planned quality objective is not achievable due to the lithological or geomorphological nature of the basin of belonging.
When the conditions of paragraph 7 occur, the definition of less stringent objectives is allowed provided that they do not lead to the further deterioration of the state of the water body and, without prejudice to the case of letter b) of the same paragraph 7, provided that the achievement of the objectives set by the third part of this decree in other water bodies included in the same hydrographic basin is not prejudiced.
In the cases provided for by paragraphs 6 and 7, the protection plans must include measures for the protection of the water body, including supplementary or restrictive provisions of the discipline of discharges or water uses. The times and objectives, as well as the relative measures, are reviewed at least every six years and any modification must be inserted as an update of the plan.
The temporary deterioration of the state of the water body due to natural circumstances or exceptional and reasonably unforeseeable force majeure, such as violent floods and prolonged droughts, or consequent to reasonably unforeseeable incidents, does not constitute a violation of the prescriptions of the third part of this decree, provided that all the following conditions are met:
a) that all measures are taken to prevent the further deterioration of the quality status of the water bodies and the compromise of the achievement of the objectives of Article 76 and of this article in other water bodies not interested by the circumstance;
b) that the protection plan expressly provides for the situations in which said events can be declared reasonably unforeseeable or exceptional, also by adopting the appropriate indicators;
c) that appropriate measures are provided for and adopted so as not to compromise the restoration of the quality of the water body once the events in question have concluded;
d) that the effects of exceptional or unforeseeable events are subject to an annual review and, subject to the reasons of Article 76, paragraph 4, letter a), everything possible is done to restore the water body to the state preceding such events as soon as this is reasonably feasible;
e) that a summary of the effects of the events and of the measures adopted or to be adopted is inserted in the subsequent update of the protection plan.
Art. 78
Quality standards for the aquatic environment
For the purposes of the protection of surface waters from pollution caused by hazardous substances, the significant water bodies of Article 76 must comply by December 31, 2008, with the quality standards reported in Table 1/A of Annex 1 to the third part of this decree, the discipline of which replaces for all purposes that of the ministerial decree of November 6, 2003, no. 367.
The water protection plans of Article 121 contain the instruments for the achievement of the standards of paragraph 1, also for the purposes of managing the sludge deriving from purification plants and the discipline of discharges.
By decree of the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, the provision of Article 16 of Directive 2000/60/EC is implemented by December 31, 2015. Within the same terms, the waters for specific destination of Article 79 must comply with the standards set by the same decree.
Art. 79
Quality objective for specific destination
Waters for specific functional destination are:
a) fresh surface waters intended for the production of drinking water;
b) waters intended for bathing;
c) fresh waters that require protection and improvement to be suitable for the life of fish;
d) waters intended for the life of mollusks.
Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 76, paragraphs 4 and 5, for the waters indicated in paragraph 1, the quality objective for specific destination established in Annex 2 to the third part of this decree is pursued for each use, with the exception of bathing waters.
The regions, for the purpose of a constant improvement of the water environment, establish programs, which are incorporated into the protection plan, to maintain or adapt the quality of the waters of paragraph 1 to the quality objective for specific destination. The regions prepare a specific list, periodically updated, of the waters of paragraph 1.
CHAPTER II - WATERS FOR SPECIFIC DESTINATION
Art. 80
Surface waters intended for the production of drinking water
Fresh surface waters, to be used or intended for the production of drinking water, are classified by the regions into categories A1, A2, and A3, according to the physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics of Table 1/A of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree.

Art. 84
Fresh waters suitable for fish life
The regions carry out the designation of fresh waters that require protection or improvement to be suitable for the life of fish. For the purposes of this designation, priority is given to:
a) the watercourses that cross the territory of national parks and state nature reserves as well as regional parks and nature reserves;
b) the natural and artificial lakes, ponds and other water bodies, located in the aforementioned territorial areas;
c) the fresh surface waters included in the wetlands declared "of international importance" pursuant to the Ramsar Convention of February 2, 1971, made executive with the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 448 of March 13, 1976, on the protection of wetlands, as well as those included in the "fauna protection oases", established by the regions and autonomous provinces pursuant to Law No. 157 of February 11, 1992;
d) the fresh surface waters which, although not included in the preceding categories, present a significant scientific, naturalistic, environmental, and productive interest as they constitute habitats of rare or endangered animal or plant species, or as the site of complex aquatic ecosystems worthy of conservation or, also, the site of ancient and traditional forms of fish production that present a high degree of ecological and economic sustainability.
The regions, within fifteen months of the designation, classify the fresh surface waters that present quality parameter values conforming with the mandatory ones provided for in Table 1/B of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree as "salmonid" or "cyprinid" fresh waters.
The designation and classification of paragraphs 1 and 2 must be gradually extended to cover the entire water body, without prejudice to the possibility of designating and classifying, within the same, some stretches as "salmonid water" and some stretches as "cyprinid water". The designation and classification are subject to revision in relation to unforeseen or supervening elements.
If required by exceptional and urgent needs for the protection of the quality of fresh waters suitable for fish life, the President of the Regional Council or the President of the Provincial Council, within their respective competencies, adopt specific and motivated measures, supplementary or restrictive of the discharges or uses of the waters.
Fresh surface waters of natural or artificial basins used for the intensive farming of fish species as well as artificial canals used for multiple purposes, drainage, or irrigation, and those specifically built for the removal of sewage and industrial wastewater are excluded from the application of this article and Articles 85 and 86.
Art. 85
Assessment of the quality of waters suitable for fish life
The waters designated and classified pursuant to Article 84 are considered suitable for fish life if they meet the requirements reported in Table 1/B of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree.
If from the samplings it results that one or more values of the parameters reported in Table 1/B of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree are not respected, the competent control authorities ascertain whether the non-observance is due to natural phenomena, to force majeure, to polluting inputs or to excessive abstractions, and propose to the competent authority the appropriate measures.
For the purposes of a more complete evaluation of the quality of the waters, the regions promote the realization of suitable biological analysis programs of the designated and classified waters.
Art. 86
Derogations
For fresh surface waters designated or classified to be suitable for fish life, the regions may derogate from the respect of the parameters indicated in Table 1/B of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree with the symbol (o) in case of exceptional meteorological circumstances or special geographical conditions and, as regards the respect of the parameters reported in the same Table, in case of natural enrichment of the water body with substances coming from the soil without direct intervention of man.
Art. 87
Waters intended for shellfish life
The regions, in agreement with the Ministry of Agricultural and Forestry Policies, designate, within the coastal and brackish marine waters that are the site of beds and natural populations of bivalve and gastropod mollusks, those requiring protection and improvement to allow their life and development and to contribute to the good quality of molluscan products directly edible by man.
The regions may proceed with complementary designations, or with the revision of the designations already made, as a function of the existence of unforeseen elements at the time of designation.
If required by exceptional and urgent needs for the protection of the quality of waters intended for shellfish life, the President of the Regional Council, the President of the Provincial Council, and the Mayor, within their respective competencies, adopt specific and motivated measures, supplementary or restrictive of the discharges or uses of the waters.
Art. 88
Assessment of the quality of waters intended for shellfish life
The waters designated pursuant to Article 87 must meet the quality requirements of Table 1/C of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree. Otherwise, the regions establish programs to reduce their pollution.
If from a sampling it results that one or more values of the parameters of Table 1/C of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree are not respected, the competent control authorities ascertain whether the non-observance is due to natural phenomena, to force majeure or to other factors of pollution and the regions adopt appropriate measures.
Art. 89
Derogations
For waters intended for shellfish life, the regions may derogate from the requirements of Table 1/C of Annex 2 to the third part of this decree in case of exceptional meteorological or geomorphological conditions.
Art. 90

2. In the protection plans, measures are adopted aimed at ensuring the equilibrium of the water balance as defined by the Basin Authorities, in compliance with the priorities established by the current legislation and taking into account the needs, availability, minimum vital flow, aquifer recharge capacity, and uses of the resource compatible with its relative qualitative and quantitative characteristics.
3. Within one hundred and eighty days from the date of entry into force of the third part of this decree, the regions define, on the basis of the guidelines adopted by the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea with his own decree, after agreement with the permanent Conference for relations between the State, the regions and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano, as well as on the basis of the criteria already adopted by the Basin Authorities, the obligations of installation and maintenance in regular working order of suitable devices for measuring the flow rates and volumes of public water derived, at the points of withdrawal and, where present, of restitution, as well as the obligations and methods of transmission of the results of the measurements to the granting Authority for their subsequent forwarding to the region and the competent Basin Authorities. The Basin Authorities provide for the transmission of the data in their possession to the Geological Survey of Italy - Soil Protection Department of the Agency for Environmental Protection and for Technical Services (APAT) according to the methods of Article 75, paragraph 6.
4. Without prejudice to what is provided for in paragraph 5, all water derivations in any case in progress at the date of entry into force of the third part of this decree are regulated by the granting Authority through the provision of releases aimed at guaranteeing the minimum vital flow in the water bodies, as defined according to the criteria adopted by the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea with a specific decree, after agreement with the State-Regions Conference, without this giving rise to the payment of indemnities by the public administration, without prejudice to the relative reduction of the state concession fee.
5. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, the granting Authorities carry out a census of all uses in progress in the same water body on the basis of the criteria adopted by the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea with his own decree, after agreement with the permanent Conference for relations between the State, the regions and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano; the same Authorities subsequently provide, where necessary, for the revision of this census, ordering prescriptions or temporal or quantitative limitations, without this giving rise to the payment of indemnities by the public administration, without prejudice to the relative reduction of the state concession fee.
6. In the preferential concession provision, issued pursuant to Article 4 of Royal Decree No. 1775 of December 11, 1933, the prescriptions relating to the releases aimed at guaranteeing the minimum vital flow in the water bodies as well as the necessary prescriptions to ensure the equilibrium of the water balance are contained.

**CHAPTER III - QUALITATIVE PROTECTION OF THE RESOURCE: DISCIPLINE OF DISCHARGES**

**Art. 100**
**Sewerage networks**
1. Agglomerations with a number of population equivalents greater than 2,000 must be provided with sewerage networks for urban wastewater.
2. The design, construction, and maintenance of the sewerage networks are carried out by adopting the best available techniques and that involve economically admissible costs, taking into account, in particular:
a) of the average flow rate, the annual volume, and the characteristics of the urban wastewater;
b) of the prevention of any backflow phenomena that involve the outflow of wastewater from the sewer sections;
c) of the limitation of the pollution of the receiving bodies, caused by overflows originating from particular meteorological events.
3. For isolated settlements, installations, or buildings that produce domestic wastewater, the regions identify individual systems or other adequate public or private systems that achieve the same level of environmental protection, indicating the times for the adaptation of the discharges to said systems.

**Art. 101**
**General criteria of the discipline of discharges**
1. All discharges are regulated according to the respect of the quality objectives of the water bodies and must in any case respect the limit values provided for in Annex 5 to the third part of this decree. The authorization can in any case establish specific derogations from the aforementioned limits and suitable prescriptions for the start-up and shutdown periods and for the eventuality of breakdowns as well as for the further transitional periods necessary for the return to regime conditions.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the regions, in the exercise of their autonomy, taking into account the maximum admissible loads and the best available techniques, define the emission limit values, different from those of Annex 5 to the third part of this decree, both in maximum admissible concentration and in maximum quantity per unit of time in order to each polluting substance and for groups or families of similar substances. The regions cannot establish less restrictive limit values than those set in Annex 5 to the third part of this decree:
a) in Table 1, relative to the discharge of urban wastewater into surface water bodies;
b) in Table 2, relative to the discharge of urban wastewater into surface water bodies falling in sensitive areas;
c) in Table 3/A, for the production cycles indicated therein;
d) in Tables 3 and 4, for those substances indicated in Table 5 of the same Annex.
3. All discharges, with the exception of domestic ones and those assimilated to them pursuant to paragraph 7, letter e), must be made accessible for sampling by the competent control authority at the point assumed as a reference for sampling, which, without prejudice to what is provided for in Article 108, paragraph 4, must be carried out immediately upstream of the discharge into the receiving body in all natural watercourses, surface and groundwater, internal and marine, sewers, on the soil and in the subsoil.
4. The competent control authority is authorized to carry out all the inspections it deems necessary to ascertain the conditions that give rise to the formation of the discharges. It may request that partial discharges containing the substances of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 18 of Table 5 of Annex 5 to the third part of this decree undergo a particular treatment before their confluence into the general discharge.
5. The emission limit values cannot in any case be achieved through dilution with waters taken exclusively for this purpose. It is in any case not permitted to dilute with cooling, washing, or waters taken exclusively for the purpose the partial discharges of paragraph 4, before their treatment to adapt them to the limits provided for by the third part of this decree. The competent authority, in the authorization phase, may prescribe that the discharge of cooling, washing waters, or waters used for the production of energy be separated from the terminal discharge of each establishment.
6. If the waters taken from a surface water body present parameters with values higher than the emission limit values, the discipline of the discharge is established on the basis of the nature of the alterations and the quality objectives of the receiving water body. In any case, the waters must be returned with qualitative characteristics not worse than those taken and without increases in flow rate to the same water body from which they were taken.
7. Without prejudice to what is provided for in Article 112, for the purposes of the discipline of discharges and authorizations, the following wastewater is assimilated to domestic wastewater:
a) from companies dedicated exclusively to the cultivation of the land and/or forestry;
b) from companies dedicated to livestock breeding that, as regards livestock effluents, practice agronomic use in conformity with the regional discipline established on the basis of the criteria and general technical norms of Article 112, paragraph 2, and that have at least one hectare of agricultural land for each of the quantities indicated in Table 6 of Annex 5 to the third part of this decree;
c) from companies dedicated to the activities of letters a) and b) that also exercise transformation or enhancement activities of agricultural production, inserted with a character of normality and functional complementarity in the company's production cycle and with raw material coming mainly from the cultivation activity of the land of which one has availability for any reason;
d) from aquaculture and fish farming plants that give rise to a discharge and that are characterized by a breeding density equal to or less than 1 kg per square meter of water surface or in which a water flow rate equal to or less than 50 liters per minute second is used;
e) having qualitative characteristics equivalent to domestic ones and indicated by the regional regulations;
f) from thermal activities, without prejudice to the regional sector disciplines.
8. Within six months from the date of entry into force of the third part of this decree, and subsequently every two years, the regions transmit to the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, to the Geological Survey of Italy - Soil Protection Department of the Agency for Environmental Protection and for Technical Services (APAT), and to the Supervisory Authority on water resources and waste(*) the information relating to the functionality of the purifiers, as well as to the disposal of the relative sludge, according to the methods of Article 75, paragraph 5.
9. In order to ensure the widest dissemination of information on the state of the environment, the regions publish every two years, on their Official Bulletins and institutional internet sites, a report on the urban wastewater disposal activities in their areas of competence, according to the methods indicated in the decree of Article 75, paragraph 5.
10. The competent Authorities may promote and stipulate program agreements and contracts with interested economic subjects, in order to favor water saving, the reuse of discharge waters, and the recovery as raw material of the purification sludge, with the possibility of resorting to economic instruments, of establishing simplifications in administrative fulfilments and of setting, for the substances considered useful, limits on discharges in derogation of the general discipline, in any case respecting the community norms and the necessary measures for the achievement of the quality objectives.
(*) Note: the text of art. 1, c. 5 of D.Lgs. 284/2006 is reported below:
"5. Articles 159, 160, and 207 of Legislative Decree No. 152 of April 3, 2006, are repealed and the Committee for the supervision of the use of water resources and the National Observatory on waste are reconstituted and exercise their respective functions. All references to the Supervisory Authority on water resources and waste contained in Legislative Decree No. 152 of April 3, 2006, are suppressed."

**Art. 102**
**Discharges of thermal waters**
1. For thermal waters that present at the origin chemical parameters with values higher than the emission limit values, a derogation from the same values is permitted provided that the waters are returned with qualitative characteristics not higher than those taken or that the same, within the maximum of 10 percent, respect the bacteriological parameters and the hazardous substances of Tables 3/A and 5 of Annex 5 to the third part of this decree are not present.

3. By way of derogation from the provisions of paragraph 1, the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea, in agreement with the Minister of Productive Activities for offshore deposits and also with the regions for onshore deposits, may also authorize the discharge of water resulting from the extraction of hydrocarbons into the deep geological units from which the hydrocarbons themselves were extracted, or into units with the same characteristics, which contain or have contained hydrocarbons, indicating the discharge methods. The discharge must not contain other wastewater or other hazardous substances, different in quality and quantity, from those derived from the separation of hydrocarbons. The relevant authorizations are issued with the prescription of the necessary technical precautions to ensure that the discharged water cannot reach other water systems or harm other ecosystems.
4. By way of derogation from the provisions of paragraph 1, the competent authority, after a preliminary investigation also aimed at verifying the absence of foreign substances, may authorize discharges into the same aquifer of water used for the washing and processing of inert materials, provided that the relative sludge consists exclusively of water and natural inert materials and their discharge does not cause damage to the aquifer. To this end, the regionally competent Regional Agency for Environmental Protection (ARPA), at the expense of the subject requesting the authorization, shall ascertain the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the sludge and the absence of possible damage to the aquifer, expressing a binding opinion on the request for discharge authorization.
5. For the activities of prospecting, exploration, and extraction of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons at sea, the direct discharge of water into the sea shall occur according to the methods provided for by the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea by his own decree, provided that the concentration of mineral oils is less than 40 mg/l. The direct discharge into the sea is progressively replaced by injection or reinjection into deep geological units, as soon as no longer productive wells suitable for injection or reinjection become available, and must in any case occur in compliance with the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3.
6. The Ministry of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea, when authorizing discharge into deep geological units as per paragraph 3, also authorizes direct discharge into the sea, according to the methods provided for in paragraphs 5 and 7, for the following cases:
a) for the fraction of excess water, if the capacity of the injector or reinjector well is not sufficient to guarantee the reception of all the water resulting from the extraction of hydrocarbons;
b) for the time necessary to carry out ordinary and extraordinary maintenance, aimed at guaranteeing the correct functionality and safety of the system consisting of the well and the injection or reinjection plant.

**CHAPTER II - AUTHORIZATION OF DISCHARGES**

**Art. 124**
**General criteria**
1. All discharges must be preventively authorized.
2. The authorization is issued to the holder of the activity from which the discharge originates. Where one or more establishments discharge to a third party, the holder of the final discharge, the wastewater from their activities, or where a consortium is established between several establishments for the joint discharge of wastewater from the activities of the consortium members, the authorization is issued to the holder of the final discharge or to the consortium itself, without prejudice to the responsibilities of the individual holders of the aforementioned activities and of the manager of the related purification plant in case of violation of the provisions of the third part of this decree. Where one or more establishments make discharges in common without having formed a consortium, the discharge authorization is issued to the holder of the final discharge, it being understood that the issuance of the authorization or its renewal is subject to the approval of a suitable project demonstrating the technical possibility of partitioning the individual discharges.
3. The authorization regime for discharges of domestic wastewater and from sewerage networks, whether or not served by urban wastewater treatment plants, is defined by the regions within the framework of the discipline referred to in Article 101, paragraphs 1 and 2.
4. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, discharges of domestic wastewater into sewerage networks are always permitted in compliance with the regulations established by the manager of the integrated water service and approved by the Area Authority.
5. The authorization regime for discharges of thermal wastewater is defined by the regions; such discharges are permitted in sewerage networks in compliance with the regulations issued by the manager of the integrated water service and in accordance with the authorization issued by the Area Authority.
6. The regions regulate the phases of provisional authorization for the discharges of wastewater treatment plants for the time necessary for their start-up.
7. Unless otherwise provided by regional regulations, the application for authorization is submitted to the province or to the Area Authority if the discharge is into a public sewer system. The competent authority shall provide a decision within sixty days of receiving the application. If said authority is non-compliant within the terms indicated above, the authorization is considered temporarily granted for the subsequent sixty days, subject to revocation.
8. Without prejudice to the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 59 of 18 February 2005, the authorization is valid for four years from the moment of its issuance. A renewal must be requested one year before its expiry. The discharge may be provisionally maintained in operation in compliance with the prescriptions contained in the previous authorization, until the adoption of a new provision, if the renewal application has been submitted in a timely manner. For discharges containing hazardous substances referred to in Article 108, the renewal must be granted explicitly within and no later than six months from the expiry date; once this term has passed without effect, the discharge must cease immediately. The regional discipline referred to in paragraph 3 may provide for specific types of discharges of domestic wastewater, where subject to authorization, forms of tacit renewal of the same.
9. For discharges into a watercourse where a natural null flow is ascertained for more than one hundred and twenty days a year, or into a non-significant water body, the authorization takes into account the period of null flow and the dilution capacity of the water body in other periods, and establishes prescriptions and limits in order to guarantee the self-purification capacities of the receiving body and the protection of groundwater.
10. In relation to the technical characteristics of the discharge, its location, and the local conditions of the interested environment, the authorization contains further technical prescriptions aimed at ensuring that the discharge, including the operations functionally connected to it, occurs in accordance with the provisions of the third part of this decree and without any prejudice to the receiving body, public health, and the environment.
11. The expenses necessary for carrying out surveys, checks, controls, and inspections necessary for the preliminary investigation of the applications for discharge authorization provided for by the third part of this decree are borne by the applicant. The competent authority determines, prior to the preliminary investigation and on a provisional basis, the sum that the applicant is required to pay, as a deposit, as a condition for the admissibility of the application. The same Authority, once the preliminary investigation is completed, shall proceed with the final settlement of the expenses incurred on the basis of a tariff prepared by it.
12. For settlements, buildings, or establishments whose activity is transferred to another location, or for those subject to a different use, expansion, or restructuring from which a discharge derives with qualitatively and/or quantitatively different characteristics from that of the pre-existing discharge, a new authorization for the discharge must be requested, if the latter is subject to it. In cases where the discharge does not have different qualitative or quantitative characteristics, communication must be given to the competent authority, which, having verified the compatibility of the discharge with the receiving body, shall adopt the measures that may become necessary.

**Art. 125**
**Application for authorization of industrial wastewater discharges**

2. The fixed assets, assets, and liabilities relating to the integrated water service, including the charges connected with the amortization of loans or the loans themselves, net of any non-repayable capital and/or interest grants, are transferred to the manager, who succeeds in the relative obligations. This transfer is taken into account in determining the tariff, in order to guarantee the invariance of the charges for public finance.

**Art. 154**
**Tariff of the integrated water service**
1. The tariff constitutes the consideration for the integrated water service and is determined taking into account the quality of the water resource and the service provided, the necessary works and adjustments, the extent of the costs of management of the works, the adequacy of the remuneration of the invested capital and the costs of management of the safeguard areas, as well as a share of the operating costs of the Area Authority, so as to ensure the full coverage of the investment and operating costs according to the principle of cost recovery and according to the "polluter pays" principle. All the components of the tariff of the integrated water service have the nature of consideration.
2. The Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea, on the proposal of the Supervisory Authority on water resources and waste(*), taking into account the need to recover environmental costs also according to the "polluter pays" principle, defines by decree the cost components for the determination of the tariff relating to water services for the various sectors of water use.
3. In order to ensure a homogeneous discipline on the national territory, by decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance, in concert with the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea, the general criteria for the determination, by the regions, of the concession fees for the use of public water are established, taking into account the environmental costs and the resource costs and also providing for reductions of the fee in the case in which the concessionaire implements a reuse of water by re-employing the water resulting downstream of the production process or a part of it or, again, returns the discharge water with the same qualitative characteristics as that withdrawn. The updating of the fees is triennial.
4. The Area Authority, for the purpose of preparing the Financial Plan referred to in Article 149, paragraph 1, letter c), determines the basic tariff, in compliance with the provisions contained in the decree referred to in paragraph 2, communicating it to the Supervisory Authority on water resources and waste(*) and to the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea.
5. The tariff is applied by the managers, in respect of the Convention and its related specification.
6. In the modulation of the tariff, facilities are ensured, including through compensations for other types of consumption, for essential domestic ones, as well as for the consumption of certain categories, according to pre-established income brackets. To achieve objectives of equitable redistribution of costs, tariff increases are permitted for second homes, for seasonal accommodation facilities, as well as for craft, commercial and industrial businesses.
7. The eventual modulation of the tariff among the municipalities takes into account the per capita investments for residents made by the municipalities themselves that are useful for the purposes of organizing the integrated water service.
(*) Note: the text of art. 1, c. 5 of D.Lgs. 284/2006 is reported below:
"5. Articles 159, 160, and 207 of Legislative Decree No. 152 of April 3, 2006, are repealed and the Committee for the supervision of the use of water resources and the National Observatory on waste are reconstituted and exercise their respective functions. All references to the Supervisory Authority on water resources and waste contained in Legislative Decree No. 152 of April 3, 2006, are suppressed."

**Art. 155**
**Tariff of the sewerage and purification service**
1. The tariff components referring to the public sewerage and purification services are due by the users even in the case where there are no purification plants or these are temporarily inactive. The manager is required to pay the relative proceeds, resulting from the tariff formulation defined pursuant to Article 154, into a restricted fund in the name of the Area Authority, which makes it available to the manager for the implementation of the interventions relating to the sewerage networks and purification plants provided for in the area plan. The tariff is not due if the user is equipped with their own collection and purification systems, provided that such systems have received specific approval from the Area Authority.
2. Pending the entrustment of the management of the local water services to the manager of the integrated water service, the municipalities already equipped with functioning purification plants, which are not in a state of financial distress, shall allocate the proceeds deriving from the purification and sewerage fee primarily to the maintenance of the plants themselves.
3. The users required to pay the tariff referring to the public sewerage service, referred to in paragraph 1, are exempt from the payment of any other tariff possibly due for the same title to other public bodies.
4. For the purpose of determining the tariff component referred to in this article, the volume of discharged water is determined as one hundred percent of the volume of water supplied.
5. For industrial users, the tariff component referred to in this article is determined on the basis of the quality and quantity of the discharged wastewater and on the basis of the "polluter pays" principle. The possibility of determining a reduced tariff component for users who provide directly for purification and who use the public sewer system is without prejudice, provided that their respective purification systems have received specific approval from the Area Authority.
6. For the purpose of encouraging the reuse of wastewater or already used water in the production cycle, the tariff for industrial users is reduced in function of the use in the production process of wastewater or already used water. The reduction is determined by applying a corrective factor to the tariff, which takes into account the quantity of reused water and the quantity of primary water used.

**Art. 156**
**Collection of the tariff**
1. The tariff is collected by the manager of the integrated water service. If the water service is managed separately, as a result of particular conventions and concessions, the relative tariff is collected by the manager of the aqueduct service, who provides for the subsequent distribution among the various interested managers within thirty days of collection.
2. With a specific convention, subject to the control of the region, the relations between the various managers for the distribution of the collection expenses are defined.
3. The voluntary and coercive collection of the tariff can be carried out according to the provisions of the decree of the President of the Republic No. 602 of 29 September 1973, by means of a convention with the Revenue Agency.

**Art. 157**
**Works for the adaptation of the water service**
1. The local authorities have the faculty to carry out the necessary works to provide for the adaptation of the water service in relation to urban plans and to concessions for new buildings in already urbanized areas, after an opinion of compatibility with the area plan rendered by the Area Authority and following a convention with the manager of the service itself, to whom the works, once realized, are entrusted in concession.

**Art. 158**
**Works and interventions for the transfer of water**
1. In order to plan the use of water resources, where the need involves or may involve the transfer of water between different regions and this goes beyond the reference areas of the hydrographic districts, the Basin Authorities, having heard the interested regions, shall promote program agreements between the regions themselves, pursuant to Article 34 of Legislative Decree No. 267 of 18 August 2000, in any case safeguarding the purposes of Article 144 of this decree. To this end, the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea and the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, each for their own competence, shall jointly take the appropriate initiatives also at the request of a Basin Authority or an interested region or also in the presence of a request presented by other public subjects or by interested private subjects, setting a deadline for defining the agreements.
2. In case of inertia, of lack of agreement regarding the use of water resources, or of non-implementation of the agreement itself, the President of the Council of Ministers shall provide in a substitute capacity, after a warning to comply within a suitable term, on the proposal of the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea.
3. The works and plants necessary for the purposes of this article are declared of national interest. Their realization and management, if of public initiative, can also be placed entirely at the expense of the State through quantification of the charge and its relative financial coverage, after deliberation of the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE), on the proposal of the Ministers of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea and of Infrastructure and Transport, each for their respective competence. The Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea shall carry out the procedures for the concession of use of the water to the user subjects and defines the relative standard convention; the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport is responsible for determining the criteria and methods for the execution and management of the interventions, as well as the entrustment for the realization and management of the plants.

Purpose
Waste management constitutes an activity of public interest and is regulated by the fourth part of this decree in order to ensure a high level of environmental protection and effective controls, taking into account the specificity of hazardous waste.
Waste must be recovered or disposed of without danger to human health and without using processes or methods that could harm the environment, and, in particular:
a) without creating risks for water, air, soil, as well as for fauna and flora;
b) without causing nuisance from noise or odors;
c) without damaging the landscape and sites of particular interest, protected on the basis of current legislation.
Waste management is carried out in accordance with the principles of precaution, prevention, proportionality, responsibility, and cooperation of all subjects involved in the production, distribution, use, and consumption of goods from which waste originates, in compliance with the principles of the national and community legal system, with particular reference to the community principle "polluter pays". To this end, waste management is carried out according to criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, economy, and transparency.
To achieve the purposes and objectives of the fourth part of this decree, the State, the regions, the autonomous provinces, and the local authorities shall exercise the powers and functions of their respective competence in waste management in accordance with the provisions of the fourth part of this decree, adopting every appropriate action and availing themselves, where appropriate, through agreements, program contracts or experimental memoranda of understanding, of public or private subjects.
The subjects referred to in paragraph 4 also constitute a complete and synergistic system that harmonizes, in a unitary context, relatively to the objectives to be pursued, the drafting of technical standards, accreditation systems, and certification systems relating directly or indirectly to environmental matters, with particular reference to waste management, according to the criteria and with the methods of article 195, paragraph 2, letter a), and in compliance with the information procedures in the sector of technical standards and regulations and of the rules relating to the services of the information society, provided for by the community directives and related implementation norms, with particular reference to Law no. 317 of 21 June 1986.

Art. 179
Priority criteria in waste management
Public administrations shall pursue, in the exercise of their respective competencies, initiatives aimed at giving priority to the prevention and reduction of the production and harmfulness of waste, in particular through:
a) the development of clean technologies that allow a more rational use and a greater saving of natural resources;
b) the technical development and placing on the market of products designed so as not to contribute or to contribute as little as possible, through their manufacture, use, or disposal, to increasing the quantity or harmfulness of waste and the risks of pollution;
c) the development of appropriate techniques for the elimination of hazardous substances contained in waste in order to facilitate its recovery.
In compliance with the priority measures referred to in paragraph 1, public administrations shall also adopt measures aimed at the recovery of waste through recycling, reuse, reutilization, or any other action intended to obtain secondary raw materials, as well as the use of waste as a source of energy.
Art. 180
Prevention of waste production
In order to promote as a priority the prevention and reduction of the production and harmfulness of waste, the initiatives of article 179 concern in particular:
a) the promotion of economic instruments, eco-balances, environmental certification systems, life cycle analysis of products, information and consumer awareness actions, the use of quality systems, as well as the development of the ecological label system for the correct evaluation of the impact of a specific product on the environment during the entire life cycle of the product itself;
b) the provision of tender clauses that enhance the technical capabilities and skills in waste production prevention;
c) the promotion of agreements and program contracts or experimental memoranda of understanding aimed at, with improving effects, the prevention and reduction of the quantity and hazardousness of waste;

Art. 181
Recovery of waste
For the purpose of proper waste management, public administrations shall favor the reduction of the final disposal of waste through:
a) reuse, re-employment, and recycling;
b) other forms of recovery to obtain secondary raw materials from waste;
c) the adoption of economic measures and the provision of contract conditions that prescribe the use of materials recovered from waste in order to favor the market for such materials;
d) the use of waste as a means to produce energy.
In order to favor and increase the activities of reuse, re-employment, and recycling and the adoption of other forms of recovery of waste, public administrations and producers shall promote analyses of the life cycles of products, eco-balances, information campaigns, and all other useful initiatives.
Companies that intend to modify their production cycles in order to reduce the quantity and hazardousness of the waste produced or to favor the recovery of materials are granted priority access to the benefits from the special revolving fund for technological innovation, provided for by articles 14 and following of Law no. 46 of 17 February 1982. The methods, times, and procedures for the granting and disbursement of the aforementioned benefits are established by decree of the Minister of Productive Activities, in concert with the Ministers of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea, of Economy and Finance, and of Health.
Public administrations shall promote and stipulate program agreements and contracts with the interested economic subjects or with the category associations representing the interested sectors, in order to favor the reuse, re-employment, recycling, and other forms of recovery of waste, as well as the use of secondary raw materials, of fuels or products obtained from the recovery of waste from separate collection. In compliance with the principles and criteria provided for by community norms and national transposition norms, said agreements and program contracts shall implement the provisions of the fourth part of this decree, in addition to establishing simplifications in administrative fulfillments in compliance with community norms and with the eventual recourse to economic instruments.
The agreements and program contracts of paragraph 4 are published in the Official Gazette and are open to the accession of interested subjects, in accordance with the communication of the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the Committee of the Regions, Com (2002) 412 final of 17 July 2002, on the basis of which the Commission may also use them in the context of self-regulation, understood as encouragement or recognition of the agreements themselves, or co-regulation, understood as a proposal to the legislator to use the agreements, where appropriate.
The methods of recovery of waste used to obtain secondary raw materials, fuels or products must guarantee the obtaining of materials with characteristics established by decree of the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea, in concert with the Minister of Productive Activities, pursuant to art. 17, paragraph 3, of Law no. 400 of 23 August 1988. Until the issuance of the aforesaid decree, the provisions of the ministerial decree of 5 February 1998 and of the decree of the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea no. 161 of 12 June 2002 continue to apply. The aforesaid characteristics may also comply with the authorizations issued pursuant to articles 208, 209, and 210 of this decree.
In compliance with the provisions of paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of this article, the interested economic subjects or the category associations representing the interested sectors, including with reference to entire economic and productive sectors, may stipulate with the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea, in concert with the Minister of Productive Activities and after hearing the opinion of the Economic and Social Council for Environmental Policies (CESPA), specific program agreements pursuant to paragraph 4 and article 206 to define the methods of recovery of waste intended for obtaining secondary raw materials, fuels, or products. The agreements shall establish the administrative procedures and fulfillments for the collection, for the reservation, for the transport of waste, for their commercialization, including through the telematic market, with particular reference to that of the recovery realized by the Chambers of Commerce, and for the controls of the characteristics and the relative testing methods; the same agreements shall also establish the characteristics of the secondary raw materials, fuels or products obtained, as well as the methods to ensure in any case their traceability until entry into the plant of effective use.
The proposal for a program agreement, with indication also of the methods used for the transport and for the use of the secondary raw materials, or the request for adhesion to an agreement already in force must be submitted to the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea, who avails himself for the investigation of the National Committee of the Register referred to in article 212 and of the Agency for the Protection of the Environment and for Technical Services (APAT), which avails itself of the Regional Agencies for the Protection of the Environment (ARPA). On the proposal for an agreement, the opinion of the Authority referred to in article 207 is also acquired.
The agreements referred to in paragraph 7 must also contain, for each type of activity, the general norms that establish the types and quantities of waste and the conditions under which the waste recovery activity is exempted from authorization, in compliance with the conditions set by article 178, paragraph 2.
The signatories of the agreements provided for in this article are registered in a special section to be established at the Register referred to in article 212, upon simple written request, and without being subject to the financial guarantees of paragraphs 7 and 9 of the cited article 212.
The program agreements referred to in paragraph 7 are approved, for the purpose of their effectiveness, by decree of the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea in concert with the Minister of Productive Activities and with the Minister of Health, and are subsequently published in the Official Gazette. Such agreements are open to the accession of all interested subjects.
The discipline on waste management applies until the completion of the recovery operations, which is realized when no further treatments are necessary for the substances, materials, and objects obtained to be used in an industrial or commercial process or marketed as a secondary raw material, fuel, or as a product to be placed, provided that the holder does not dispose of it or has not decided, or has no obligation, to dispose of it.
The discipline on waste management does not apply to materials, substances or objects that, without the need for transformation operations, already have the characteristics of secondary raw materials, fuels or products identified pursuant to this article, unless the holder disposes of them or has decided, or has the obligation, to dispose of them.
The subjects who transport or use secondary raw materials, fuels or products, in compliance with the provisions of this article, are not subject to the legislation on waste, unless they dispose of them or have decided, or have the obligation, to dispose of them.
Art. 182
Waste disposal
The disposal of waste is carried out in safe conditions and constitutes the residual phase of waste management, after verification, by the competent authority, of the technical and economic impossibility of carrying out the recovery operations referred to in article 181. To this end, the aforesaid verification concerns the availability of technologies developed on a scale that allows their application in economically and technically valid conditions in the relevant industrial sector, taking into consideration the costs and benefits, regardless of whether they are applied or produced domestically, provided they can be accessed under reasonable conditions.
Waste to be sent for final disposal must be reduced as much as possible both in mass and in volume, enhancing prevention and reuse, recycling, and recovery activities.
The disposal of waste is carried out with recourse to an integrated and adequate network of disposal plants, through the best available techniques and taking into account the relationship between the costs and the overall benefits, in order to:
a) achieve self-sufficiency in the disposal of non-hazardous urban waste in optimal territorial areas;
b) allow the disposal of waste in one of the most appropriate plants closest to the places of production or collection, in order to reduce the movements of the waste itself, taking into account the geographical context or the need for specialized plants for certain types of waste;
c) use the most suitable methods and technologies to guarantee a high degree of protection for the environment and public health.
In compliance with the prescriptions contained in Legislative Decree no. 133 of 11 May 2005, the construction and management of new plants can be authorized only if the relative combustion process is accompanied by energy recovery with a minimum quota of transformation of the calorific value of the waste into useful energy, calculated on an annual basis, established with appropriate technical norms approved by decree of the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea in concert with the Minister of Productive Activities, taking into account any existing sector technical norms, including at the community level.
It is forbidden to dispose of non-hazardous urban waste in regions other than those where it is produced, without prejudice to any regional or international agreements, if the territorial aspects and the technical-economic opportunity of reaching optimal levels of user service require it. The fractions of urban waste subject to separate collection intended for recovery are excluded from the ban, for which free circulation on the national territory is always permitted in order to favor their recovery as much as possible, privileging the concept of proximity to the recovery plants.
The disposal of waste in the sewer system is regulated by article 107, paragraph 3.
The activities of waste disposal in landfills are regulated according to the provisions of Legislative Decree no. 36 of 13 January 2003, implementing Directive 1999/31/EC.
The disposal of the biodegradable fraction obtained from the physical separation treatment of the residual fraction of solid urban waste is permitted within the wastewater treatment plants after a technical check of the plants by the managing body.

Art. 186
Excavated earth and rock
Excavated earth and rock, including from tunnels, and the residues from stone processing intended for effective use for backfills, fillings, embankments, and ground materials do not constitute waste and are, therefore, excluded from the scope of application of the fourth part of this decree only in the case where, even when contaminated, during the production cycle, by polluting substances deriving from excavation, drilling, and construction activities, they are used, without preliminary transformations, according to the methods provided for in the project submitted to environmental impact assessment or, if the project is not subject to environmental impact assessment, according to the methods provided for in the project approved by the competent administrative authority, where this is expressly provided, after the opinion of the regional and autonomous province agencies for environmental protection, provided that the average composition of the entire mass does not present a concentration of pollutants higher than the maximum limits provided for by the current norms and by the decree of paragraph 3.
For the purposes of this article, the works whose project is subject to environmental impact assessment constitute a single production cycle, even if the materials of paragraph 1 are intended for different uses, provided that these uses are all provided for in the project.
The respect of the limits of paragraph 1 can be verified, as an alternative to the assessments on the production site, also through assessments on the deposit sites, in case of impossibility of immediate use. The maximum acceptable limits as well as the analysis methods of the materials for their characterization, to be performed according to the criteria of Annex 2 of Title V of the fourth part of this decree, are determined by decree of the Minister of the Environment and for the Protection of the Land and Sea to be issued within ninety days from the entry into force of the fourth part of this decree, unless lower limits are provided for by special provisions. Until the issuance of the aforesaid decree, the acceptable limit concentration values of Annex 1, table 1, column B, of the decree of the Minister of the Environment no. 471 of 25 October 1999 continue to apply.
The respect of the maximum concentration limits of pollutants of paragraph 3 must be verified through characterization activities of the materials of paragraph 1, to be repeated whenever variations in the production process that originates such materials occur.
For the materials of paragraph 1, for effective use for backfills, fillings, embankments, and ground materials is also intended the destination provided for in the project to different industrial production cycles, as well as the filling of cultivated quarries, or the relocation to another site, for any reason authorized by the competent administrative authority, if this is expressly provided, after, where the relative project is not subject to environmental impact assessment, the opinion of the regional and autonomous province agencies for environmental protection, provided that the limits of paragraph 3 are respected and the relocation is carried out according to project methods of environmental reshaping of the interested territory.
If the materials of paragraph 1 are intended for different industrial production cycles, the administrative authorities competent to exercise the functions of surveillance and control over the same cycles shall verify, without additional charges for public finance, also by carrying out periodic checks, the effective destination for the authorized use of the materials; to this end, the user is required to document their origin, quantity, and specific destination.
For the purposes of the opinion of the regional and autonomous province agencies for environmental protection, of which paragraphs 1 and 5, for projects not subject to environmental impact assessment, a declaration of the subject who carries out the works or of the client, made pursuant to article 47 of the decree of the President of the Republic no. 445 of 28 December 2000, is attached to the request for reuse pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 6, in which it is certified that in the execution of the works no polluting substances have been used, that the reuse occurs without preliminary transformations, that the reuse occurs for one of the works of paragraphs 1 and 5 of this article, as authorized by the competent authority, where this is expressly provided, and that in the excavated material the concentration of pollutants is not higher than the current limits with reference also to the destination site.
In the case where the immediate reuse of the excavated material is not possible, the deposit site of the material, the quantity, the typology of the material must also be indicated, and at the time of reuse, the request must be integrated with what is provided for in paragraphs 6 and 7. The reuse must occur within six months of the deposit, unless an extension is granted upon a motivated request from the interested party.
The opinion of paragraph 5 must be rendered within the peremptory term of thirty days, after which the region shall provide in a substitute capacity upon the request of the interested party.
Waste deriving from the processing of minerals and quarry materials is in no case assimilable to urban waste.

Art. 187
Prohibition of mixing hazardous waste
It is forbidden to mix different categories of hazardous waste of Annex G to the fourth part of this decree or hazardous waste with non-hazardous waste.
By way of derogation from the prohibition of paragraph 1, the mixing of hazardous waste with each other or with other waste, substances, or materials may be authorized pursuant to articles 208, 209, 210, and 211 if the conditions of article 178, paragraph 2, are met, and for the purpose of making the recovery and disposal of waste safer.
Without prejudice to the application of the specific sanctions and in particular those of article 256, paragraph 5, anyone who violates the prohibition of paragraph 1 is required to proceed at his own expense with the separation of the mixed waste if it is technically and economically possible and to satisfy the conditions of article 178, paragraph 2.
Art. 188
Burdens of producers and holders
The burdens relating to the disposal activities are borne by the holder who delivers the waste to an authorized collector or to a subject who carries out the disposal operations, as well as by the previous holders or by the producer of the waste.
The producer or holder of special waste shall fulfill his obligations with the following priorities:
a) self-disposal of the waste;
b) conferment of the waste to third parties authorized pursuant to the current provisions;

**TITLE II - MANAGEMENT OF PACKAGING**

**Art. 217**
**Scope of application**
1. This title governs the management of packaging and packaging waste both to prevent and reduce its impact on the environment and to ensure a high level of environmental protection, and to ensure the functioning of the market, as well as to avoid discrimination against imported products, prevent the emergence of obstacles to trade and distortions of competition, and ensure the maximum possible return from packaging and packaging waste, in accordance with Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 1994, as integrated and amended by Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of which the fourth part of this decree constitutes transposition into the internal legal order. The management systems must be open to the participation of the interested economic operators.
2. The discipline of paragraph 1 concerns the management of all packaging placed on the national market and all packaging waste resulting from its use, used or
---
produced by industries, businesses, offices, shops, services, households, for any reason, whatever the materials they are composed of. The operators of the respective packaging supply chains as a whole guarantee, according to the principles of "shared responsibility," that the environmental impact of packaging and packaging waste is reduced to a minimum throughout the entire life cycle.
3. The existing requirements regarding the quality of packaging, such as those relating to the safety, health protection, and hygiene of the packaged products, as well as the existing provisions on transport and hazardous waste, remain in force.

**Art. 218**
**Definitions**
1. For the purposes of applying this title, the following definitions apply:

b) sales packaging or primary packaging: packaging designed to constitute, at the point of sale, a sales unit for the final user or consumer;
c) multiple packaging or secondary packaging: packaging designed to constitute, at the point of sale, the grouping of a certain number of sales units, regardless of whether it is sold as such to the final user or consumer, or whether it serves only to facilitate the stocking of shelves at the point of sale. It can be removed from the product without altering its characteristics;
d) transport packaging or tertiary packaging: packaging designed to facilitate the handling and transport of goods, from raw materials to finished products, of a certain number of sales units or multiple packagings to prevent their handling and transport-related damage, excluding containers for road, rail, sea, and air transport;
e) reusable packaging: packaging or a component of packaging that has been conceived and designed to withstand a minimum number of trips or rotations within a reuse circuit during its life cycle.
f) packaging waste: any packaging or packaging material, falling under the definition of waste in Article 183, paragraph 1, letter a), excluding production residues;
g) management of packaging waste: the management activities referred to in Article 183, paragraph 1, letter d);

i) reuse: any operation in which packaging conceived and designed to be able to complete, during its life cycle, a minimum number of movements or rotations is refilled or reused for a use identical to that for which it was conceived, with or without the support of auxiliary products present on the market that allow the packaging itself to be filled; such reused packaging becomes packaging waste when it ceases to be reused;
l) recycling: reprocessing in a production process of packaging waste for its original function or for other purposes, including organic recycling and excluding energy recovery;
m) recovery of waste generated from packaging: operations that use packaging waste to generate secondary raw materials, products, or fuels, through mechanical, thermal, chemical, or biological treatments, including sorting, and, in particular, the operations provided for in Annex C to the fourth part of this decree;
n) energy recovery: the use of combustible packaging waste as a means to produce energy through thermal valorization with or without other waste but with heat recovery;
o) organic recycling: the aerobic (composting) or anaerobic (biomethanation) treatment, by microorganisms and under controlled conditions, of the
---
biodegradable parts of packaging waste, with the production of stabilized organic residues or biogas with energy recovery, excluding landfilling, which cannot be considered a form of organic recycling;
p) disposal: any operation aimed at permanently removing packaging or packaging waste from the economic and/or collection circuit and, in particular, the operations provided for in Annex B to the fourth part of this decree;
q) economic operators: producers, users, recoverers, recyclers, end-users, public administrations, and managers;
r) producers: suppliers of packaging materials, manufacturers, processors, and importers of empty packaging and packaging materials;

z) voluntary agreement: a formally concluded agreement between the competent public administrations and the interested economic sectors, open to all interested parties, which regulates the means, instruments, and actions to achieve the objectives of Article 220;
aa) supply chain: an economic and productive organization that carries out its activity, from the beginning of the processing cycle to the finished packaging product, as well as carrying out recovery and recycling activities at the end of the life of the packaging itself;
bb) take-back: the operation of recovering primary packaging waste or waste otherwise conferred to the public service, as well as assimilated special waste, managed by the operators of urban hygiene services or similar;
cc) return: the operation of returning used secondary and tertiary packaging from the user or end-user, excluding the consumer, to the supplier of the goods or distributor and, backwards, along the supply logistics chain up to the producer of the packaging itself;
dd) used packaging: secondary or tertiary packaging already used and intended to be taken-back or returned.
2. The definition of packaging as per letters a) to e) of paragraph 1 is also based on the interpretative criteria indicated in art. 3 of Directive 94/62/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/12/EC and on the illustrative examples reported in Annex E to the fourth part of this decree.

**Art. 219**
**Guiding criteria for the management of packaging waste**
1. The management of packaging and packaging waste is guided by the following general principles:
a) encouragement and promotion of source prevention of the quantity and hazardousness in the manufacturing of packaging and packaging waste, especially through initiatives, including of an economic nature in accordance with the principles of Community law, aimed at promoting the development of clean technologies and reducing the production and use of packaging at the source, as well as favoring the production of reusable packaging and its concrete reuse;
b) encouragement of recycling and recovery of raw materials, development of separate collection of packaging waste, and promotion of market opportunities to encourage the use of materials obtained from recycled and recovered packaging;
c) reduction of the flow of packaging waste destined for final disposal through other forms of recovery;
d) application of prevention measures consisting of national programs or similar actions to be adopted after consulting the interested economic operators.
2. In order to ensure the accountability of economic operators in accordance with the "polluter pays" principle as well as their cooperation according to the principles of
---
"shared responsibility," the management of packaging waste is also inspired by the following principles:
a) identification of the obligations of each economic operator, ensuring that the cost of separate collection, valorization, and disposal of packaging waste is borne by producers and users in proportion to the quantities of packaging placed on the national market and that the public administration organizes the separate collection;
b) promotion of forms of cooperation between public and private entities;
c) information to users of packaging and in particular to consumers according to the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 195 of 19 August 2005, implementing Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information;
d) encouragement of the return of used packaging and the conferment of packaging waste in separate collection by the consumer.
3. The information referred to in letter c) of paragraph 2 concerns in particular:
a) the available return, collection, and recovery systems;
b) the role of packaging users and consumers in the process of reuse, recovery, and recycling of packaging and packaging waste;
c) the meaning of the marks affixed to packaging as they appear on the market;
d) the significant elements of the management programs for packaging and packaging waste, as referred to in Article 225, paragraph 1, and the significant elements of the specific provisions contained in the regional plans pursuant to Article 225, paragraph 6.
4. In accordance with the decisions taken by the Commission of the European Union, by decree of the Minister for the Environment and the Protection of the Territory in concert with the Minister for Production Activities, the necessary technical measures for the application of the provisions of this title are adopted, with particular reference to hazardous packaging, including domestic, as well as to primary packaging of medical equipment and pharmaceutical products, small packaging, and luxury packaging. Where health aspects are involved, the aforesaid decree is adopted in concert with the Minister of Health.
5. All packaging must be appropriately labeled according to the methods established by decree of the Minister for the Environment and the Protection of the Territory in concert with the Minister for Production Activities in accordance with the decisions adopted by the Commission of the European Union, to facilitate the collection, reuse, recovery, and recycling of packaging, as well as to give correct information to consumers about the final destinations of the packaging. The aforesaid decree must also prescribe the obligation to indicate, for the purposes of identification and classification of the packaging by the interested industry, the nature of the packaging materials used, on the basis of Commission Decision 97/129/EC.

**Art. 220**
**Recovery and recycling objectives**
1. To comply with the principles of Article 219, producers and users must achieve the final recycling and recovery objectives for packaging waste in accordance with the community discipline indicated in Annex E to the fourth part of this decree.
2. To ensure control of the achievement of the recycling and recovery objectives, the National Packaging Consortium referred to in Article 224 shall annually communicate to the National Section of the Waste Cadastre, using the single declaration form as per art. 1 of Law No. 70 of 25 January 1994, the data, referring to the previous solar year, relating to the quantity of packaging for each material and for each type of packaging placed on the market, as well as, for each material, the quantity of reused packaging and recycled and recovered packaging waste from the national market. The aforesaid communications can be submitted by the subjects referred to in Article 221, paragraph 3, letters a) and c), for those who have joined the management systems provided therein and sent simultaneously to the National Packaging Consortium. Packaging waste exported from the Community pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259 of 1 February 1993, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1420 of 29 April 1999, and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1547 of 12 July 1999, are taken into consideration for the purposes of fulfilling the obligations and achieving the objectives of paragraph 1, only if there is suitable documentary evidence proving that the recovery and/or recycling operation was carried out in ways equivalent to
---
those provided for in this regard by Community legislation. The Authority referred to in Article 207, within one hundred and twenty days of its establishment, shall draw up a list of non-EU countries where recovery and/or recycling operations are considered equivalent to those provided for in this regard by Community legislation, also taking into account any decisions and orientations of the European Union on the matter.
3. Public administrations and managers shall encourage, for environmental reasons or in consideration of the cost-benefit ratio, energy recovery where it is preferable to recycling, provided that it does not result in a significant deviation from the national recovery and recycling objectives.
4. Public administrations and managers shall encourage, where appropriate, the use of materials obtained from recycled packaging waste for the manufacture of packaging and other products by:
a) improving market conditions for such materials;
b) revising existing standards that prevent the use of such materials.
5. Without prejudice to what is established by Article 224, paragraph 3, letter e), should the overall objectives for recycling and recovery of packaging waste as set in paragraph 1 not be achieved by the foreseen deadline, by decree of the President of the Council of Ministers, after deliberation of the Council of Ministers, on the proposal of the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory and the Minister for Production Activities, economic measures shall be applied to the different types of packaging materials, proportionate to the failure to achieve individual objectives, the revenue of which is paid into the State budget to be reallocated by decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance to a specific chapter of the Ministry for the Environment and Protection of the Territory. These sums will be used to promote prevention, separate collection, recycling, and recovery of packaging waste.
6. The objectives referred to in paragraph 1 refer to packaging waste generated on the national territory, as well as to all recycling and recovery systems net of scraps and are adopted and updated in accordance with community legislation by decree of the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory in concert with the Minister for Production Activities.
7. The Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory and the Minister for Production Activities shall notify the Commission of the European Union, pursuant to and according to the methods of articles 12, 16, and 17 of Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 1994, the report on the implementation of the provisions of this title accompanied by the data acquired pursuant to paragraph 2 and the projects of the measures that are intended to be adopted within the scope of the same title.
8. The Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory and the Minister for Production Activities shall periodically provide the European Union and the other member States with data on packaging and packaging waste according to the tables and schemes adopted by the Commission of the European Union with Decision 2005/270/EC of 22 March 2005.

**Art. 221**
**Obligations of producers and users**
1. Producers and users are responsible for the correct and effective environmental management of packaging and packaging waste generated from the consumption of their own products.
2. Within the scope of the objectives referred to in Articles 205 and 220 and the Program referred to in Article 225, producers and users, upon request of the service operator and as provided for by the program agreement referred to in Article 224, paragraph 5, shall fulfill the obligation to take back primary packaging waste or waste otherwise conferred to the public service of the same nature and collected in a separate manner. To this end, to ensure the necessary connection with the separate collection activity organized by public administrations and for the other purposes indicated in Article 224, producers and users shall participate in the National Packaging Consortium, unless one of the systems referred to in paragraph 3, letters a) and c) of this article is adopted.
3. To fulfill the obligations of recycling and recovery as well as the obligations of taking back used packaging and collecting secondary and tertiary packaging waste on private surfaces, and with reference to the obligation of taking back, upon indication of the National Packaging Consortium referred to in Article 224, packaging waste conferred by the public service, producers may alternatively:
a) organize autonomously, also in an associated form, the management of their own packaging waste
---
on the entire national territory;
b) join one of the consortia referred to in Article 223;
c) certify under their own responsibility that a system for the return of their own packaging has been put in place, through suitable documentation demonstrating the self-sufficiency of the system, in compliance with the criteria and methods of paragraphs 5 and 6.
4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, users are required to deliver used secondary and tertiary packaging and secondary and tertiary packaging waste to a collection point organized by the producers and agreed upon with them. Users may, however, confer the said packaging and packaging waste to the public service within the limits deriving from the criteria determined pursuant to Article 195, paragraph 2, letter e). Until the adoption of the criteria referred to in Article 195, paragraph 2, letter e), the conferment of used secondary and tertiary packaging and secondary and tertiary packaging waste to the public service is permitted for private areas not exceeding 150 square meters in municipalities with a resident population of less than ten thousand inhabitants, or 250 square meters in municipalities with a resident population of more than ten thousand inhabitants.
5. Producers who do not join the National Packaging Consortium and a consortium under Article 223 must request from the Authority referred to in Article 207, upon providing suitable and exhaustive documentation, the recognition of the system adopted pursuant to paragraph 3, letters a) or c), within ninety days of assuming the status of producer pursuant to Article 218, paragraph 1, letter r) or from withdrawal from even just one of the aforementioned consortia; the withdrawal is effective twelve months after its communication. To this end, producers must demonstrate that they have organized the system according to criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, that the system is effectively and autonomously functioning, and that it is capable of achieving, within the scope of the activities carried out, the recovery and recycling objectives of Article 220. Producers must also ensure that users and end-users of packaging are informed about the methods of the adopted system. The Authority, after acquiring the necessary evaluation elements from the National Packaging Consortium, shall decide within ninety days of the request. In case of no response within the aforementioned term, the interested party shall ask the Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory for the adoption of the relative substitute measures to be issued within the following sixty days. The Authority is required to present an annual summary report on all the investigations carried out. The recognitions already made under the previous legislation remain valid.
6. The producers referred to in paragraph 5 shall prepare and transmit to the National Packaging Consortium referred to in Article 224 their own Specific Prevention Program which constitutes the basis for the elaboration of the general program referred to in Article 225.
7. By September 30 of each year, the producers referred to in paragraph 5 shall present to the Authority provided for in Article 207 and to the National Packaging Consortium a specific prevention and management plan for the following solar year, which will be included in the general prevention and management program referred to in Article 225.
8. By May 31 of each year, the producers referred to in paragraph 5 are also required to present to the Authority provided for in Article 207 and to the National Packaging Consortium a report on the management for the previous solar year, including the nominal indication of the users who, up to consumption, participate in the system referred to in paragraph 3, letters a) or c), of the specific program and the results achieved in the recovery and recycling of packaging waste; the same report may highlight the problems inherent in achieving the institutional goals and any proposals for adapting the legislation.
9. The non-recognition of the system pursuant to paragraph 5, or the revocation ordered by the Authority, after notice to the interested party, if the results obtained are insufficient to achieve the objectives of Article 220 or if the obligations provided for in paragraphs 6 and 7 have been violated, entails for the producers the obligation to participate in one of the consortia referred to in Article 223 and, together with their users at every level up to consumption, in the consortium provided for in Article 224. The Authority's provisions are communicated to the interested producers and to the National Packaging Consortium. The mandatory adhesion to the consortia arranged in application of this paragraph has retroactive effect only for the purposes of paying the environmental contribution provided for by Article 224, paragraph 3, letter h), and the related default interest. To producers and users who, within ninety days of receiving the Authority's communication, do not proceed to join the consortia and pay the sums due to them, the sanctions provided for also apply.
---
by Article 261.
10. The costs are borne by the producers and users for:
a) the take-back of used packaging and the collection of secondary and tertiary packaging waste;
b) the additional charges related to the separate collection of packaging waste conferred to the public service for which the Area Authority requests the National Packaging Consortium or, on its behalf, the subjects referred to in paragraph 3 to proceed with the take-back;
c) the reuse of used packaging;
d) the recycling and recovery of packaging waste;
e) the disposal of secondary and tertiary packaging waste.
11. The return of used packaging or packaging waste, including the conferment of waste in separate collection, must not entail economic charges for the consumer.

**Art. 222**
**Separate collection and obligations of the public administration**
1. The public administration must organize adequate separate collection systems to allow the consumer to confer selected packaging waste from domestic waste and other types of packaging waste to the public service. In particular:
a) homogeneous coverage of the territory in each optimal territorial area must be guaranteed, taking into account the geographical context;
b) the management of separate collection must be carried out according to criteria that prioritize the efficiency, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the service, as well as coordination with the management of other waste.
2. In the event that the Authority referred to in Article 207 ascertains that public administrations have not activated adequate separate collection systems for packaging waste, also for the achievement of the objectives of Article 205, and in particular those of recovery and recycling of Article 220, it may request the National Packaging Consortium to replace the operators of the separate collection services, also by using public or private subjects identified by the National Packaging Consortium itself through transparent and selective procedures, on a temporary and urgent basis, however for a period not exceeding twenty-four months, provided that this occurs within optimally identified areas, for the organization and/or integration of the service deemed insufficient. If the National Packaging Consortium, to achieve the recovery and recycling objectives provided for by Article 220, decides to adhere to the request, the value of the tariff applied for the collection of the corresponding urban waste will be paid to it, net of the revenues from the sale of the materials and the fee due for the take-back of the packaging waste and of the homogeneous commodity fractions.

Within four years from the date of entry into force of the regulation referred to in paragraph 6, full coverage of the costs must be gradually ensured.
6. The Minister for the Environment and Protection of the Territory, in concert with the Minister for Production Activities, after consulting the State-Regions Conference and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano, the qualified representatives of the economic and social interests present in the Economic and Social Council for Environmental Policies (CESPA), and the interested parties, shall regulate, with a specific regulation to be issued within six months from the date of entry into force of the fourth part of this decree and in compliance with the provisions of this article, the general criteria on the basis of which the cost components are defined and the tariff is determined, also with reference to the reductions referred to in paragraph 7, while ensuring in any case the absence of charges for the interested authorities.
7. In determining the tariff, reductions may be provided for domestic users and for those used for seasonal or non-continuous use, duly documented and ascertained, which also take into account income indices articulated by user groups and territories. In this case, the financial plan must indicate the resources necessary to ensure the full coverage of the reduced revenues resulting from the reductions, according to the criteria established by the regulation referred to in paragraph 6.
8. The regulation referred to in paragraph 6 also takes into account the objectives of improving the productivity and quality of the service provided and the programmed inflation rate.
9. The possible modulation of the tariff takes into account the investments made by the municipalities or by the managers that are useful for the organization of the service.
10. A reduction coefficient is applied to the tariff, proportional to the quantities of assimilated waste that the producer demonstrates to have sent for recovery through a certificate issued by the subject who carries out the recovery activity of the waste itself.
11. Until the issuance of the regulation referred to in paragraph 6 and until the completion of the requirements for the application of the tariff, the existing regulatory disciplines shall continue to apply.
12. The voluntary and coercive collection of the tariff can be carried out according to the provisions of the decree of the President of the Republic of 29 September 1973, no. 602, through an agreement with the Revenue Agency.

**TITLE V - REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES**

**Art. 239**
**Principles and scope of application**
1. This title regulates remediation and environmental restoration interventions for contaminated sites and defines the procedures, criteria, and methods for carrying out the necessary operations for the elimination of the sources of pollution and in any case for the reduction of the concentrations of polluting substances, in harmony with community principles and norms, with particular reference to the "polluter pays" principle.
2. Without prejudice to the discipline set forth in title 1 of the fourth part of this decree, the provisions of this title do not apply to:
a) the abandonment of waste regulated by the fourth part of this decree. In this case, if, following the removal, initiation of recovery, disposal of abandoned or uncontrollably deposited waste, an exceedance of the attention values is ascertained, it will be necessary to proceed with the characterization of the area for the purpose of any remediation and environmental restoration interventions to be carried out pursuant to this title;
b) remediation interventions governed by special laws, except within the limits of what is expressly referred to by the same or what is not regulated by them.
3. Remediation and environmental restoration interventions for areas characterized by diffuse pollution are regulated by the regions with specific plans, without prejudice to the competencies and procedures provided for sites subject to remediation of national interest and in any case in compliance with the general criteria of this title.

**Art. 240**
**Definitions**
1. For the purposes of applying this title, the following definitions apply:
a) site: the area or portion of territory, geographically defined and determined, understood in its various environmental matrices (soil, subsoil, and groundwater) and including any building and plant structures present;
b) contamination threshold concentrations (CSC): the contamination levels of the environmental matrices that constitute values above which the characterization of the site and the site-specific risk analysis are necessary, as identified in Annex 5 to the fourth part of this decree. In the case where the potentially contaminated site is located in an area affected by anthropic or natural phenomena that have caused the exceedance of one or more contamination threshold concentrations, these latter are assumed to be equal to the existing background value for all the exceeded parameters;
c) risk threshold concentrations (CSR): the contamination levels of the environmental matrices, to be determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the site-specific risk analysis procedure according to the principles illustrated in Annex 1 to the fourth part of this decree and on the basis of the results of the characterization plan, the exceedance of which requires safety measures and remediation. The concentration levels so defined constitute the acceptability levels for the site;
d) potentially contaminated site: a site in which one or more concentration values of the pollutants found in the environmental matrices are higher than the contamination threshold concentration values (CSC), pending the completion of the characterization and site-specific health and environmental risk analysis operations, which will allow the determination of the state of contamination or not on the basis of the risk threshold concentrations (CSR);
e) contaminated site: a site in which the risk threshold concentration values (CSR), determined by applying the risk analysis procedure referred to in Annex 1 to the fourth part of this decree on the basis of the results of the characterization plan, are exceeded;
f) uncontaminated site: a site in which the contamination found in the environmental matrices is lower than the contamination threshold concentration values (CSC) or, if higher, is still lower than the risk threshold concentration values (CSR) determined following the site-specific health and environmental risk analysis;
g) site with ongoing activity: a site in which productive activities, both industrial and commercial, are in operation, as well as the appurtenant areas and those used for ancillary economic activities, including maintenance and heritage protection activities for the purpose of the subsequent resumption of activities;
h) decommissioned site: a site where productive activities have ceased;
i) prevention measures: initiatives to counter an event, an act, or an omission that has created an imminent threat to health or the environment, understood as a sufficiently probable risk that damage to health or the environment will occur in the near future, in order to prevent or minimize the occurrence of such a threat;
l) remediation measures: any action or combination of actions, including mitigation or provisional measures aimed at repairing, restoring, or replacing damaged natural resources and/or services, or providing an equivalent alternative to such resources or services;
m) emergency safety measures: any immediate or short-term intervention, to be implemented in the emergency conditions referred to in letter t) in case of sudden contamination events of any nature, aimed at containing the diffusion of the primary sources of contamination, preventing their contact with other matrices present on the site, and removing them, pending any further remediation or operational or permanent safety measures;
n) operational safety measures: the set of interventions carried out in a site with ongoing activity aimed at ensuring an adequate level of safety for people and the environment, pending further permanent safety or remediation interventions to be carried out upon cessation of the activity. They also include the contamination containment interventions to be implemented on a transitional basis until the execution of the remediation or permanent safety measures, in order to prevent the diffusion of contamination.
---
within the same matrix or between different matrices. In such cases, suitable monitoring and control plans must be prepared to verify the effectiveness of the adopted solutions;
o) permanent safety measures: the set of interventions aimed at definitively isolating the sources of pollution with respect to the surrounding environmental matrices and ensuring a high and definitive level of safety for people and the environment. In such cases, monitoring and control plans and land use limitations with respect to the provisions of urban planning instruments must be provided;
p) remediation: the set of interventions aimed at eliminating the sources of pollution and polluting substances or reducing their concentrations present in the soil, subsoil, and groundwater to a level equal to or lower than the risk threshold concentration values (CSR);
q) restoration and environmental restoration: the interventions of environmental and landscape redevelopment, also constituting a complement to the remediation or permanent safety interventions, which allow the site to be recovered for its effective and definitive usability for the intended use in conformity with urban planning instruments;
r) diffuse pollution: the contamination or chemical, physical, or biological alterations of the environmental matrices determined by diffuse sources and not attributable to a single origin;
s) site-specific health and environmental risk analysis: site-specific analysis of the effects on human health deriving from prolonged exposure to the action of substances present in the contaminated environmental matrices, conducted with the criteria indicated in Annex 1 to the fourth part of this decree;
t) emergency conditions: events upon the occurrence of which the execution of emergency interventions is necessary, such as:
1) current or potential concentrations of vapors in confined spaces close to explosive levels or suitable to cause acute harmful effects to health;
2) presence of significant quantities of product in a separate phase on the ground or in surface water courses or in the aquifer;
3) contamination of wells for drinking water or agricultural purposes;
4) risk of fires and explosions.

**Art. 241**
**Regulation of agricultural areas**
1. The regulation relating to remediation, environmental restoration, and emergency, operational, and permanent safety measures for areas intended for agricultural production and livestock farming is adopted by decree of the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory in concert with the Ministers of Production Activities, Health, and Agricultural and Forestry Policies.

**Art. 242**
**Operational and administrative procedures**
1. Upon the occurrence of an event that is potentially capable of contaminating the site, the person responsible for the pollution shall, within twenty-four hours, implement the necessary prevention measures and immediately communicate this to the authorities pursuant to and with the methods of Article 304, paragraph 2. The same procedure applies to the identification of historical contaminations that may still pose risks of aggravating the contamination situation.
2. The person responsible for the pollution, having implemented the necessary prevention measures, shall carry out, in the areas affected by the contamination, a preliminary investigation on the parameters subject to the pollution and, if it is ascertained that the contamination threshold concentration (CSC) level has not been exceeded, shall proceed to restore the contaminated area, giving notice thereof, with a specific self-certification, to the municipality and the competent province for the territory within forty-eight hours of the communication. The self-certification concludes the notification procedure of this article, without prejudice to the verification and control activities by the competent authority to be carried out in the following fifteen days. In the case where the pollution is not attributable to a single event, the parameters to be evaluated must be identified on a case-by-case basis, based on the history of the site and the activities carried out there over time.
3. If the preliminary investigation referred to in paragraph 2 ascertains that the CSC has been exceeded even for a single parameter, the person responsible for the pollution shall immediately notify the municipality and the competent provinces for the territory, with a description of the prevention and emergency safety measures adopted. In the following thirty days, he shall present to the aforementioned administrations, as well as to the territorially competent region, the characterization plan with the requirements of Annex 2 to the fourth part of this decree. Within the following thirty days, the region, having convened the services conference, shall authorize the characterization plan with any supplementary prescriptions. The regional authorization constitutes consent for all works connected to the characterization, replacing any other authorization, concession, concert, agreement, or permit from the public administration.
4. On the basis of the results of the characterization, the site-specific risk analysis procedure is applied to the site for the determination of the risk threshold concentrations (CSR). The criteria for the application of the risk analysis procedure are reported in Annex 1 to the fourth part of this decree. Within six months of the approval of the characterization plan, the responsible party shall present the results of the risk analysis to the region. The services conference convened by the region, following the investigation carried out in contradiction with the responsible party, who is given at least twenty days' notice, shall approve the risk analysis document within sixty days of its receipt. This document is sent to the members of the services conference at least twenty days before the date set for the conference and, in the case of a majority decision, the resolution of adoption shall provide an adequate and analytical motivation with respect to the dissenting opinions expressed during the conference.
5. If the results of the risk analysis procedure show that the concentration of contaminants present on the site is lower than the risk threshold concentrations, the services conference, with the approval of the risk analysis document, shall declare the procedure positively concluded. In this case, the services conference may prescribe the implementation of a monitoring program on the site regarding the stabilization of the situation found in relation to the results of the risk analysis and the current land use destination. To this end, the responsible party, within sixty days of the above approval, shall send to the competent province and region for the territory a monitoring plan in which are identified:
a) the parameters to be monitored;
b) the frequency and duration of the monitoring.
6. The region, after consulting the province, shall approve the monitoring plan within thirty days of its receipt. The aforementioned term may be suspended once only, if the competent authority deems it necessary to request, by means of an adequately motivated act, documentary integrations or further details of the project, assigning a suitable term for compliance. In this case, the term for approval shall run from the receipt of the integrated project. At the end of the monitoring period, the responsible party shall communicate this to the region and the province, sending a technical report summarizing the results of the monitoring carried out. In the case where the monitoring activities reveal the exceedance of one or more of the risk threshold concentrations, the responsible party must initiate the remediation procedure of paragraph 7.
7. If the results of the risk analysis procedure show that the concentration of contaminants present on the site is higher than the risk threshold concentration values (CSR), the responsible party shall submit to the region, within the following six months from the approval of the risk analysis document, the operational project for the remediation or safety measures, operational or permanent, and, where necessary, the further measures of repair and environmental restoration, in order to minimize and reduce to an acceptable level the risk deriving from the state of contamination present on the site. The region, having acquired the opinion of the municipality and the interested province through a specific services conference and having heard the responsible party, shall approve the project, with any prescriptions and integrations, within sixty days of its receipt. This term may be suspended once only, if the region deems it necessary to request, by means of an adequately motivated act, documentary integrations or further details of the project, assigning a suitable term for compliance. In this hypothesis, the term for the approval of the project shall run from the presentation of the integrated project. For the sole purposes of the realization and operation of the plants and equipment necessary for the implementation of the operational project and for the time strictly necessary for its implementation

the same, the regional authorization referred to in this paragraph replaces for all purposes the authorizations, concessions, agreements, understandings, no-objections, opinions, and consents provided for by current legislation, including, in particular, those relating to the environmental impact assessment, where necessary, the management of excavated soil and rocks within the area subject to the intervention, and the discharge of water drawn from the aquifers. The authorization also constitutes a zoning variance and entails a declaration of public utility, urgency, and non-deferability of the works. With the project approval measure, the execution times are also established, also indicating any necessary prescriptions for the execution of the works, and the amount of the financial guarantees is fixed, in an amount not exceeding fifty percent of the estimated cost of the intervention, which must be provided in favor of the region for the correct execution and completion of the same interventions.
8. The criteria for the selection and execution of remediation and environmental restoration interventions, operational or permanent safety measures, as well as for the identification of the best available techniques at sustainable costs (B.A.T.N.E.E.C. - Best Available Technology Not Entailing Excessive Costs) pursuant to community regulations are reported in Annex 3 to the fourth part of this decree.
9. The operational safety measures, concerning contaminated sites with ongoing activities, guarantee adequate health and environmental safety and prevent further propagation of contaminants. The operational safety measure projects are accompanied by accurate plans for monitoring the effectiveness of the adopted measures and indicate whether, upon cessation of the activity, a remediation or permanent safety measure intervention will be necessary.
10. In the case of characterization, remediation, safety measures, and environmental restoration of sites with ongoing activities, the region, without prejudice to the obligation to guarantee the protection of public health and the environment, when approving the project, shall ensure that the said interventions are structured in such a way as to be compatible with the continuation of the activity.
11. In the case of events that occurred before the entry into force of the fourth part of this decree, which subsequently manifest themselves on that date in the absence of immediate risk to the environment and public health, the interested party shall communicate to the competent region, province, and municipality the existence of a potential contamination together with the site characterization plan, in order to determine its extent and extension with reference to the parameters indicated in the CSCs and shall apply the procedures of paragraphs 4 and following.
12. The investigations and preliminary activities are carried out by the province, which avails itself of the technical competence of the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection and coordinates with the other administrations.
13. The procedure for approving the characterization and the remediation project takes place in a Services Conference convened by the region and constituted by the administrations ordinarily competent to issue the permits, authorizations, and concessions for the realization of the interventions included in the plan and in the project. The relative documentation is sent to the members of the services conference at least twenty days before the date set for the discussion and, in the case of a majority decision, the resolution of adoption must provide an adequate and analytical motivation with respect to the dissenting opinions expressed during the conference. The province is responsible for issuing the certification of completed remediation. If the province does not proceed to issue this certification within thirty days of receiving the resolution of adoption, the region shall issue it.

**Art. 243**
**Groundwater**
1. Groundwater drawn from underground aquifers, within the scope of remediation interventions of a site, may be discharged, directly or after being used in production cycles in operation on the site itself, in compliance with the emission limits for industrial wastewater into surface waters as per this decree.
2. In derogation of the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 104, for the sole purposes of aquifer remediation, the reinjection, after treatment, of groundwater into the same geological unit from which it was extracted is permitted, indicating the type of treatment, the qualitative-quantitative characteristics of the reinjected water, the methods of reinjection, and the safety measures for the portion of the aquifer affected by the extraction/reinjection system. The reinjected water must have undergone a treatment aimed at the remediation of the aquifer and must not contain other discharged waters or other dangerous substances, different in quality and quantity, from those present in the drawn water.

**Art. 244**
**Ordinances**
1. Public administrations that, in the exercise of their functions, identify sites in which they ascertain that the contamination levels are higher than the contamination threshold values, shall communicate this to the competent region, province, and municipality.
2. The province, having received the communication referred to in paragraph 1, after having carried out the appropriate investigations aimed at identifying the person responsible for the exceedance event and having heard the municipality, shall, with a motivated ordinance, order the person responsible for the potential contamination to proceed pursuant to this title.
3. The ordinance referred to in paragraph 2 is in any case also notified to the owner of the site for the purposes and effects of Article 253.
4. If the person responsible is not identifiable or does not take action and neither the owner of the site nor any other interested party takes action, the interventions that become necessary pursuant to the provisions of this title are adopted by the competent administration in accordance with the provisions of Article 250.

**Art. 245**
**Obligations of intervention and notification by parties not responsible for the potential contamination**
1. The procedures for safety, remediation, and environmental restoration interventions regulated by this title may in any case be initiated on the initiative of the interested non-responsible parties.
2. Without prejudice to the obligations of the person responsible for the potential contamination under Article 242, the owner or manager of the area who detects the exceedance or the concrete and current danger of exceedance of the contamination threshold concentrations (CSC) must notify the competent region, province, and municipality and implement the prevention measures according to the procedure of Article 242. The province, once it has received the above communications, shall take action, after consulting the municipality, to identify the responsible party in order to proceed with the remediation interventions. The owner or another interested party is in any case granted the right to intervene voluntarily at any time to carry out the necessary interventions within the site under their ownership or availability.
3. If the interested parties proceed pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 within six months from the date of entry into force of the fourth part of this decree, or have already done so previously, the start of the obligation for the remediation of sites for events prior to the entry into force of the fourth part of this decree will be defined by the competent region for the territory on the basis of the dangerousness of the site, determined in general by the regional plan for the remediation of polluted areas or by its possible excerpts, without prejudice in any case to the right of the interested parties to proceed with the interventions before the aforementioned deadline.

**Art. 246**
**Program agreements**
1. The subjects obliged to carry out the interventions of this title and the other interested subjects have the right to define the methods and timing for the execution of the interventions through specific program agreements stipulated, within six months of the approval of the risk analysis document of Article 242, with the competent administrations pursuant to the provisions of this title.
2. In the case where there are subjects who intend or are required to provide for the simultaneous remediation of a plurality of sites affecting the territory of multiple regions, the times and methods of intervention can be defined with specific program agreements stipulated, within twelve months of the approval of the risk analysis document of Article 242, with the interested regions.
3. In the case where there are subjects who intend or are required to provide for the simultaneous remediation of a plurality of sites located throughout the national territory or there are multiple subjects interested in the remediation of the same site of national interest, the times and methods of intervention can be defined with a program agreement to be stipulated, within eighteen months of the approval of the risk analysis document of Article 242, with the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory in concert with the Ministers of Health and of Production Activities, in agreement with the State-Regions Conference.

**Art. 247**
**Sites subject to seizure**
1. In the case where the polluted site is subject to seizure, the judicial authority that ordered it may authorize access to the site for the execution of safety, remediation, and environmental restoration interventions of the areas, also for the purpose of preventing the further propagation of pollutants and the consequent worsening of the environmental situation.

**Art. 248**
**Controls**
1. The documentation relating to the site characterization plan and the operational project, including the repair measures, the monitoring to be carried out, the use limitations, and the prescriptions possibly dictated pursuant to Article 242, paragraph 4, is transmitted to the competent province and Regional Agency for Environmental Protection for the purpose of carrying out controls on the conformity of the interventions with the approved projects.
2. The completion of remediation, permanent safety, and operational safety interventions, as well as their conformity to the approved project, are ascertained by the province through a specific certification based on a technical report prepared by the territorially competent Regional Agency for Environmental Protection.
3. The certification referred to in paragraph 2 constitutes a title for the release of the financial guarantees referred to in Article 242, paragraph 7.

**Art. 249**
**Small-scale contaminated areas**
1. For small-scale contaminated areas, the simplified intervention procedures reported in Annex 4 to the fourth part of this decree apply.

**Art. 250**
**Remediation by the administration**
1. If the parties responsible for the contamination do not directly carry out the fulfillments ordered by this title, or if they are not identifiable and neither the owner of the site nor other interested parties take action, the procedures and interventions of Article 242 are carried out ex officio by the territorially competent municipality and, if this does not take action, by the region, according to the order of priority established by the regional plan for the remediation of polluted areas, also using other public or private entities, identified as a result of specific public evidence procedures. In order to advance the sums for the aforementioned interventions, the regions may establish specific funds within their budget availability.

**Art. 251**
**Census and registry of sites to be remediated**
1. The regions, on the basis of the criteria defined by the Agency for the Protection of the Environment and for Technical Services (APAT), shall prepare the registry of sites subject to remediation procedures, which must contain:
a) the list of sites subject to remediation and environmental restoration intervention as well as the interventions carried out in the same sites;
b) the identification of the subjects to whom the remediation is incumbent;
c) the public entities that the region intends to use, in case of non-compliance by the obliged subjects, for the purposes of ex officio execution, without prejudice to the awarding of the necessary works through public tender or recourse to the procedures of Article 242.
2. If, following the site-specific risk analysis, an exceedance of the risk concentrations is ascertained, this situation is reported in the urban destination certificate, as well as in the cartography and in the implementation technical standards of the general urban planning instrument of the municipality and is communicated to the competent State Revenue Office.
3. To ensure the effectiveness of the collection and transfer of data and information, the Agency for the Protection of the Environment and for Technical Services (APAT) shall define, in collaboration with the regions and the regional agencies for environmental protection, the contents and structure of the essential data of the registry, as well as the methods for their transposition into information systems connected to the network of the National Environmental Information System (SINA).

**Art. 252**
**Sites of national interest**
1. Sites of national interest, for the purposes of remediation, are identifiable in relation to the characteristics of the site, the quantities and hazardousness of the pollutants present, the significance of the impact on the surrounding environment in terms of health and ecological risk, as well as prejudice to cultural and environmental assets.
2. The identification of sites of national interest is provided for by decree of the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, in agreement with the interested regions, according to the following principles and guiding criteria:
a) remediation interventions must concern areas and territories, including water bodies, of particular environmental value;
b) remediation must concern areas and territories protected pursuant to legislative decree no. 42 of 22 January 2004;
c) the health and environmental risk deriving from the detected exceedance of the risk threshold concentrations must be particularly high due to the density of the population or the extension of the interested area;
d) the socio-economic impact caused by the pollution of the area must be significant;
e) the contamination must constitute a risk to assets of historical and cultural interest of national relevance;
f) the interventions to be implemented must concern sites included in the territory of more than one region.
3. For the purposes of the perimeter definition of the site, the municipalities, provinces, regions, and other local authorities are consulted, ensuring the participation of the responsible parties as well as the owners of the areas to be remediated, if different from the responsible parties.
4. The remediation procedure of Article 242 for sites of national interest is attributed to the competence of the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, after consulting the Ministry of Production Activities. The Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory may also avail itself of the Agency for the Protection of the Environment and for Technical Services (APAT), the regional agencies for the protection of the environment of the interested regions, and the National Institute of Health, as well as other qualified public or private entities.
5. In the case where the responsible party does not take action or is not identifiable, or the owner of the contaminated site or another interested party does not take action, the interventions are prepared by the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, availing itself of the Agency for the Protection of the Environment and for Technical Services (APAT), the National Institute of Health, and E.N.E.A., as well as other qualified public or private entities.
6. The authorization of the project and the related interventions replaces for all purposes the authorizations, concessions, agreements, understandings, no-objections, opinions, and consents provided for by current legislation, including, among others, those relating to the realization and operation of the plants and equipment necessary for their implementation. The authorization also constitutes a zoning variance and entails a declaration of public utility, urgency, and non-deferability of the works.
7. If the project provides for the realization of works subject to an environmental impact assessment procedure, the approval of the remediation project also includes such an assessment.
8. Pending the finalization of the authorization measure of the preceding paragraphs, once the technical investigation is completed, the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory may authorize, on a provisional basis, upon request of the interested party, where there are urgent reasons and without prejudice to the acquisition of the positive opinion of the environmental compatibility assessment, where provided, the start of the works for the realization of the related remediation interventions, according to the positively evaluated project, with any prescriptions, from the services conference convened by the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory. The provisional authorization produces the effects of Article 242, paragraph 7.
9. The area affected by the remediation of the former Strillale landfill (Grosseto) is qualified as a site of national interest under current legislation. A subsequent decree of the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory will provide for the perimeter definition of the aforementioned area.

**Art. 253**
**Real burdens and special privileges**
1. The interventions of this title constitute a real burden on the contaminated sites if carried out ex officio by the competent authority pursuant to Article 250. The real burden is registered following the approval of the remediation project and must be indicated in the urban destination certificate.
2. The costs incurred for the interventions of paragraph 1 are secured by a special real estate privilege on the same areas, pursuant to and for the effects of Article 2748, second paragraph, of the civil code. This privilege can also be exercised to the detriment of the rights acquired by third parties on the property.
3. The privilege and the repetition of the costs can be exercised, against the owner of the site who is not guilty of the pollution or the danger of pollution, only following a motivated measure of the competent authority which justifies, among other things, the impossibility of ascertaining the identity of the responsible party or which justifies the impossibility of exercising recourse actions against the same party or their ineffectiveness.
4. In any case, the owner not responsible for the pollution may be required to reimburse, on the basis of a motivated measure and in compliance with the provisions of law no. 241 of 7 August 1990, the costs of the interventions adopted by the competent authority only within the limits of the market value of the site determined following the execution of the same interventions. In the case where the owner not responsible for the pollution has spontaneously provided for the remediation of the polluted site, he has the right to recourse against the person responsible for the pollution for the costs incurred and for any greater damage suffered.
5. The remediation interventions of polluted sites may be assisted, on the basis of a specific legislative financing provision, by public contributions within the maximum limit of fifty percent of the related costs if there are pre-eminent public interests connected to needs of health and environmental protection or occupational needs. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply to the aforesaid public contributions.

**Art. 269**
**Authorization for atmospheric emissions**
1. Without prejudice to what is established by Article 267, paragraph 3, by paragraphs 14 and 16 of this article, and by Article 272, paragraph 5, for all plants that produce emissions, an authorization must be requested pursuant to the fifth part of this decree.
2. The operator who intends to install a new plant or transfer a plant from one location to another shall submit an authorization application to the competent authority, accompanied by:
a) the project of the plant in which the specific activity for which the plant is intended is described, the techniques adopted to limit the emissions and the quantity and quality of such emissions, the operating methods and the quantity, type, and product characteristics of the fuels intended for use, as well as, for plants subject to this condition, the technical minimum defined through the plant parameters that characterize it, and
b) by a technical report describing the overall production cycle in which the specific activity for which the plant is intended is inserted and indicating the period foreseen between commissioning and reaching full operational capacity.
3. For the purpose of issuing the authorization, the competent authority shall convene, within thirty days of receiving the request, a services conference pursuant to Articles 14 and following of Law no. 241 of 7 August 1990, during which a simultaneous examination of the interests involved in other administrative proceedings is also carried out, in particular, in the proceedings conducted by the municipality pursuant to the decree of the President of the Republic no. 380 of 6 June 2001, and the royal decree no. 1265 of 27 July 1934. Any integrations of the application must be transmitted to the competent authority within thirty days of the request; if the competent authority does not decide within a period of one hundred and twenty days or, in case of integration of the authorization application, within one hundred and fifty days of receiving the application itself, the operator may, within the following sixty days, request the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory to provide, notifying this request also to the competent authority. The Minister shall decide on the request, in concert with the Ministers of Health and of Production Activities, after consulting the interested municipality, within ninety days or, in the cases provided for by Article 281, paragraph 1, within one hundred and fifty days of receiving it; once this term has elapsed, art. 2, paragraph 5, of Law no. 241 of 7 August 1990 shall apply.
4. The authorization shall establish, pursuant to Articles 270 and 271:
a) for emissions that are technically channellable, the methods of capture and channelling;
b) for channelled emissions or for which channelling has been ordered, the emission limit values, the prescriptions, the sampling and analysis methods, the criteria for evaluating the conformity of the measured values to the limit values, and the frequency of the controls under the operator's responsibility;
c) for diffuse emissions, specific prescriptions aimed at ensuring their containment.
5. The authorization shall establish the period that must elapse between the commissioning and the reaching of full operational capacity of the plant. The commissioning must be communicated to the competent authority at least fifteen days in advance. The authorization shall establish the date by which the data relating to the emissions made in a continuous period of controlled operation of a duration not less than ten days, starting from the reaching of full operational capacity, and the duration of this period, as well as the number of samplings to be carried out, must be communicated to the competent authority.
6. The competent authority for control shall carry out the first check on compliance with the authorization within six months of the date of reaching full operational capacity of the plant.
7. The authorization issued pursuant to this article has a duration of fifteen years. The renewal application must be submitted at least one year before the expiry date.
In the absence of a decision on the renewal application for the authorization issued pursuant to this article, the operation of the plant may continue even after the expiry of the authorization if the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory has been requested to provide for it pursuant to paragraph 3, and has not yet made a decision. The updating of the authorization pursuant to paragraph 8 entails the start of a new fifteen-year period only in the case of a substantial modification.
8. The operator who intends to subject a plant to a modification, which involves a variation of what is indicated in the project or in the technical report of paragraph 2 in the authorization of paragraph 3 or in the authorization issued pursuant to the decree of the President of the Republic no. 203 of 24 May 1988, or in the documents provided for by art. 12 of that decree, including those relating to the operating methods or the fuels used, shall notify the competent authority or, if the modification is substantial, shall submit an application for updating pursuant to this article. If the modification for which communication has been given is substantial, the competent authority shall order the operator to submit an application for updating the authorization, to which the provisions of this article apply. If the modification is not substantial, the competent authority shall, where necessary, update the existing authorization. If the competent authority does not express itself within sixty days, the operator may proceed with the execution of the non-substantial communicated modification, without prejudice to the power of the competent authority to provide for it subsequently, within six months of receiving the communication. A substantial modification is intended as one that involves an increase or a qualitative variation of the emissions or that alters the technical conditions for their channelling. This paragraph also applies to those who intend to modify an activity authorized pursuant to paragraphs 10, 11, 12, and 13. What is provided for by Article 275, paragraph 11, remains unaffected.
9. The competent authority for control is authorized to carry out at the plants all the inspections it deems necessary to ascertain compliance with the authorization.
10. Without prejudice to what is provided for by Article 275, whoever intends to carry out, in a non-occasional manner, painting activities in a place adapted for this purpose and in the absence of a plant shall submit a specific application to the competent authority, unless the activity falls among those provided for by Article 272, paragraph 1. The competent authority shall evaluate whether, pursuant to Article 270, paragraphs 1 and 2, the emissions produced by such activities must be channelled through the creation of a plant.
11. In the case where the channelling of emissions is ordered pursuant to paragraph 10, the limit values and prescriptions of Article 271, contained in the authorizations issued in accordance with this article, shall apply, or, if the activity falls among those provided for by Article 272, paragraph 2, the limit values and prescriptions contained in the general authorizations regulated therein shall apply. In the case where the channelling of emissions is not ordered, the authorization shall establish specific prescriptions aimed at ensuring the containment of the diffuse emissions produced by the activity; the provisions of this article, excluding those that may refer only to channelled emissions, shall apply to such authorization.
12. The provisions of paragraphs 10 and 11 also apply to whoever intends to carry out, in a non-occasional manner and in a place adapted for this purpose, in the absence of a plant, activities of processing, transformation, or conservation of agricultural materials, which produce emissions, or activities of production, manipulation, transport, loading, unloading, or storage of dusty materials, unless such activities fall among those provided for by Article 272, paragraph 1. For activities involving dusty materials, the norms of Part I of Annex V to the fifth part of this decree shall apply.
13. If a place is adapted, in the absence of a fixed structure, for the non-occasional exercise of the activities provided for in paragraphs 10 or 12, carried out therein on an occasional basis by multiple subjects, the authorization is requested by the manager of the place. For the purposes of this paragraph, manager means the subject who exercises decision-making power over the methods and conditions of use of that area by whoever carries out the activity.
14. The following plants are not subject to authorization:
a) combustion plants, including cogeneration generator sets, with a nominal thermal input of less than 1 MW, powered by biomass as per Annex X to the fifth part of this decree, by diesel oil, as such or in emulsion, or by biodiesel;
b) combustion plants powered by fuel oil, as such or in emulsion, with a nominal thermal input of less than 0.3 MW;
c) combustion plants powered by methane or LPG, with a nominal thermal input of less than 3 MW;
d) combustion plants, located within waste disposal plants, powered by landfill gas, residual gases from purification processes, and biogas, with a nominal thermal input not exceeding 3 MW, if the recovery activity is subject to the simplified authorization procedures provided for by the fourth part of this decree and such procedures have been completed;
e) combustion plants powered by biogas as per Annex X to the fifth part of this decree, with a total nominal thermal input of less than or equal to 3 MW;
f) cogeneration generator sets powered by methane or LPG, with a nominal thermal input of less than 3 MW;
g) cogeneration generator sets powered by petrol with a nominal thermal input of less than 1 MW;

i) emergency and safety plants, analysis and research laboratories, pilot plants for tests, research, experimentation, identification of prototypes. This exemption does not apply in the case of emission of carcinogenic, toxic for reproduction or mutagenic substances or substances of particularly high toxicity and cumulativeness, as identified by Part II of Annex I to the fifth part of this decree.
15. The competent authority may provide, with its own general measure, that the operators of the plants of paragraph 14 shall communicate to the same, in advance, the date of commissioning of the plant or the start of the activity.
16. The storage plants for mineral oils, including liquefied gases, are not subject to authorization. The operators are in any case required to adopt appropriate measures to contain diffuse emissions and to respect any further prescriptions possibly ordered, for the same purposes, with a specific measure by the competent authority.

**Art. 270**
**Channelling of emissions**
1. In the authorization phase, the competent authority shall verify if the diffuse emissions of a plant or of a fixed machine with functional autonomy are technically channellable on the basis of the best available techniques and on the basis of the relevant prescriptions of Annex I to the fifth part of this decree and, in this case, shall order their capture and channelling.
2. In the presence of particular situations of health risk or zones that require particular environmental protection, the competent authority shall order the capture and channelling of diffuse emissions pursuant to paragraph 1 even if the identified technique does not satisfy the availability requirement of Article 268, paragraph 1, letter aa), number 2).
3. By decree of the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, in concert with the Ministers of Production Activities and of Health, the criteria to be used for the verification of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be established.
4. If multiple plants with similar technical and constructive characteristics, having emissions with homogeneous chemical-physical characteristics and located in the same place, are intended for specific identical activities, the competent authority, taking into account the technical and economic conditions, may consider them as a single plant.
5. In the case of channelled emissions or for which channelling has been ordered, each plant or fixed machine with functional autonomy, also identified pursuant to paragraph 4, must have a single emission point, without prejudice to what is provided for in paragraphs 6 and 7. Unless otherwise provided for by other provisions of this title, the emission limit values apply to each emission point.
6. Where it is not technically possible to ensure compliance with paragraph 5, the competent authority may authorize a new plant or fixed machine with functional autonomy having multiple emission points. In this case, the emission limit values expressed as mass flow, emission factor, and percentage refer to the complex of emissions of the plant or of the fixed machine with functional autonomy, and those expressed as concentration refer to the emissions of the single points, without prejudice to the application of Article 271, paragraph 10.
7. Where it is not technically possible to ensure compliance with paragraph 5, the competent authority may authorize the channelling of the emissions of multiple new plants or fixed machines with functional autonomy into one or more common emission points, also belonging to plants prior to 2006 and 1988, provided that the emissions of all the plants or of all the fixed machines with functional autonomy present homogeneous chemical-physical characteristics. In this case, the most severe of the emission limit values expressed as concentration provided for the single plants or fixed machines with functional autonomy applies to each common emission point.
8. The plants prior to 2006 and 1988 shall adapt to what is provided for in paragraph 5 or, where this is not technically possible, to what is provided for in paragraphs 6 and 7 within three years following the first renewal of the authorization carried out pursuant to Article 281, paragraph 1. For the purposes of the application of paragraphs 4, 5, 6, and 7, the competent authority shall also take into account the documentation prepared by the commission of Article 281, paragraph 9.

**Art. 271**
**Emission limit values and prescriptions**
1. Annex I to the fifth part of this decree establishes the emission limit values, with the indication of a maximum value and a minimum value, and the prescriptions for the operation of plants prior to 1988 and of all the plants of Article 269, paragraph 14, except for those of letter d). The emission limit values and the prescriptions established in Annex I apply to new plants and to plants prior to 2006 exclusively in the cases expressly provided for by that Annex. Annex V to the fifth part of this decree establishes specific prescriptions for the emissions of dust from activities of production, manipulation, transport, loading, unloading, or storage of dusty materials and for the emissions in the form of gas or vapor deriving from activities of processing, transport, transfer, and storage of liquid organic substances.
2. With a specific decree, adopted pursuant to Article 281, paragraph 5, Annex I to the fifth part of this decree shall be integrated with the setting of limit values and prescriptions for the operation of new plants and those prior to 2006. With this decree, the same Annex I is also updated. Until the adoption of this decree, the methods previously in use shall apply for plants prior to 1988 and 2006, and for new plants, the methods established by the competent authority on the basis of the relevant CEN technical standards or, where these are not available, of the relevant ISO technical standards, or, where these are also not available, on the basis of the relevant national or international technical standards.
3. The region or the autonomous province may establish, by law or by general provision, on the basis of the best available techniques, emission limit values between the minimum and maximum values set by Annex I to the fifth part of this decree. The region or the autonomous province may also establish, for the purposes of evaluating the extent of the dilution of emissions, characteristic flow rates for specific types of plants.
4. The plans and programs provided for by art. 8 of legislative decree no. 351 of 4 August 1999, and by art. 3 of legislative decree no. 183 of 21 May 2004, may establish emission limit values and prescriptions, also concerning the construction or operating conditions of the plant, more severe than those set by Annex I to the fifth part of this decree and by the legislation of paragraph 3, provided that this is necessary for the achievement of the limit values and target values of air quality. Until the issuance of such plans and programs, the emission limit values and the prescriptions contained in the plans adopted pursuant to art. 4 of the decree of the President of the Republic no. 203 of 24 May 1988 shall continue to apply.
5. The plans and programs of paragraph 4 may establish emission limit values and prescriptions for new plants or plants prior to 2006 even before the adoption of the decree of paragraph 2.
6. For each of the plants for which the application of Article 269 is submitted, the authorization establishes the emission limit values and the prescriptions on the basis of the values and prescriptions set by Annex I to the fifth part of this decree, by the legislation of paragraph 3, and by the plans and programs relating to air quality. The prescriptions aimed at ensuring the containment of diffuse emissions are established on the basis of the best available techniques and on the basis of the relevant provisions of Annexes I and V to the fifth part of this decree. For substances for which emission values are not set, the authorization establishes specific limit values with reference to those provided for similar substances in terms of chemistry and having similar effects on health and the environment.
7. In the case where the legislation of paragraph 3 and the plans and programs relating to air quality do not establish emission limit values, the maximum value established by Annex I to the fifth part of this decree must not in any case be exceeded in the authorization.
8. For new plants or for plants prior to 2006, until the adoption of the decree of paragraph 2, the authorization establishes the emission limit values and the prescriptions on the basis of the values and prescriptions set in the plans and programs of paragraph 5 and on the basis of the best available techniques. In the authorization, the minimum emission values that Annex I sets for plants prior to 1988 must not in any case be exceeded. The prescriptions aimed at ensuring the containment of diffuse emissions are established on the basis of the best available techniques and of Annex V to the fifth part of this decree. The last period of paragraph 6 applies.
9. Without prejudice to what is provided for in paragraph 8, the authorization may establish emission limit values more severe than those set by Annex I to the fifth part of this decree, by the legislation of paragraph 3, and by the plans and programs relating to air quality:
a) upon renewal, on the basis of the best available techniques, also taking into account the relationship between the costs and the overall benefits;
b) for zones of particular natural value, identified within the plans and programs adopted pursuant to Articles 8 and 9 of legislative decree no. 351 of 4 August 1999, or of art. 3 of legislative decree no. 183 of 21 May 2004, or of art. 4 of the decree of the President of the Republic no. 203 of 24 May 1988.
10. In the case provided for by Article 270, paragraph 6, the authorization may provide that the emission limit values refer to the weighted average of the emissions of polluting substances that are equal or belong to the same class and have homogeneous chemical characteristics, coming from the different emission points of the plant. The total mass flow of the plant must not be greater than what it would be if the emission limit values were applied to the single emission points.
11. The emission limit values and the reference volumetric oxygen content refer to the volume of gaseous effluent reported to normal conditions, after deduction, unless otherwise indicated in Annex I to the fifth part of this decree, of the volumetric content of water vapor.
12. Unless otherwise indicated in Annex I to the fifth part of this decree, the reference volumetric oxygen content is that deriving from the process. If in the emission the volumetric oxygen content is different from the reference one, the measured concentrations must be corrected using the following formula:
E = EM * (21 - O2) / (21 - O2M)
where:
EM = measured concentration
E = concentration
O2 M = measured oxygen content
O2 = reference oxygen content
13. The emission limit values refer to the quantity of emission diluted to the extent that is unavoidable from a technological and operational point of view. In case of further dilution of the emission, the measured concentrations must be corrected using the following formula:
E = EM * PM / P
where:
PM = measured flow rate
EM = measured concentration
P = flow rate of gaseous effluent diluted to the extent that is unavoidable from a technological and operational point of view
E = concentration referred to P
14. Unless otherwise established by the fifth part of this decree, the emission limit values apply to periods of normal operation of the plant, understood as the periods in which the plant is in operation, excluding the start-up and shutdown periods and the periods in which malfunctions occur such as not to allow compliance with the values themselves. The authorization may establish specific prescriptions for these start-up and shutdown periods and for the eventuality of such malfunctions and identify further transitional periods in which the emission limit values do not apply. If a malfunction occurs such as not to allow compliance with emission limit values, the competent authority must be informed within the following eight hours and may order the reduction or cessation of activities or other prescriptions, without prejudice to the obligation of the operator to proceed with the functional restoration of the plant in the shortest possible time. The operator is in any case required to take all appropriate precautions to minimize emissions during the start-up and shutdown phases. Periods of oscillation that occur regularly in the performance of the plant's function do not in any case constitute start-up or shutdown periods.
15. For the large combustion plants of Article 273 and for the plants of Article 275, this article applies with reference to the emission limit values provided therein.
16. For plants subject to integrated environmental authorization, the limit values and prescriptions of this article apply for the purpose of issuing such authorization, without prejudice to the power of the competent authority to establish more severe limit values and prescriptions.
17. Annex VI to the fifth part of this decree establishes the criteria for evaluating the conformity of the measured values to the emission limit values. With a specific decree pursuant to Article 281, paragraph 5, the aforesaid Annex VI shall be integrated, providing for specific sampling and analysis methods for emissions as well as methods capable of guaranteeing the quality of the continuous emission monitoring systems. Until the adoption of such decree, the methods previously in use shall apply for plants prior to 1988 and 2006, and for new plants, the methods established by the competent authority on the basis of the relevant CEN technical standards or, where these are not available, of the relevant ISO technical standards, or, where these are also not available, on the basis of the relevant national or international technical standards.

**Art. 272**
**Plants and activities under derogation**
1. The competent authority may provide, with its own general measure, that the operators of the plants or activities listed in Part I of Annex IV to the fifth part of this decree shall communicate to the same that they fall within this list and, in advance, the date of commissioning of the plant or the start of the activity, unless otherwise provided for by the same Annex. The aforesaid list, referring to plants or activities whose emissions are scarcely relevant for the purposes of atmospheric pollution, may be updated and integrated as provided for by Article 281, paragraph 5, also on the proposal of the regions, the autonomous provinces, and the representative associations of productive categories.
2. For specific categories of plants, identified in relation to the type and methods of production, the competent authority may adopt specific general authorizations, for each single category of plants, in which the emission limit values, the prescriptions, the adaptation times, the sampling and analysis methods, and the frequency of the controls are established. The emission limit values and the prescriptions are established in accordance with Article 271, paragraphs 6 and 8. The competent authority must in any case proceed with the adoption of such general authorizations, within two years from the date of entry into force of the fifth part of this decree, for the plants and activities of Part II of Annex IV to the fifth part of this decree. In case of failure to adopt the general authorization, within the prescribed term, the same is issued with a specific decree of the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory and the operators of the interested plants communicate their adhesion to the competent authority; the power of this authority to subsequently adopt new general authorizations, the adhesion to which entails, for the interested subject, the lapse of that adopted by the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, is without prejudice. The operators of the plants for which a general authorization has been adopted may in any case submit an authorization application pursuant to Article 269.
3. The operator of the plants or activities of paragraph 2 shall submit to the competent authority, at least forty-five days before the installation of the plant or the start of the activity, an application for adhesion to the general authorization. The competent authority may, with its own measure, deny the adhesion in the case where the requirements provided for by the general authorization are not respected or in the presence of particular situations of health risk or zones that require particular environmental protection. The general authorization establishes the requirements of the application for adhesion and may provide, for the plants and activities of Part II of Annex IV to the fifth part of this decree, specific simplified application models, in which the quantities and qualities of the emissions are deductible from the quantities of raw and auxiliary materials used. The competent authority shall proceed, every fifteen years, to the renewal of the general authorizations adopted pursuant to this article. For the general authorizations issued pursuant to the decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of 21 July 1989 and the decree of the President of the Republic of 25 July 1991, the first renewal is carried out within fifteen years from the date of entry into force of the fifth part of this decree or, if such authorizations are not compliant with the provisions of this title, within one year from the same date. In all cases of renewal, the operation of the plant or activity may continue if the operator, within sixty days of the adoption of the new general authorization, submits an application for adhesion accompanied, where necessary, by an adaptation project and if the competent authority does not deny the adhesion. In case of failure to submit the application within the foreseen term, the plant or activity is considered in operation without authorization for emissions.
4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 do not apply:
a) in the case of emission of carcinogenic, toxic for reproduction, or mutagenic substances or of substances of particularly high toxicity and cumulativeness, as identified by Part II of Annex I to the fifth part of this decree, or
b) in the case where the substances or preparations classified by legislative decree no. 52 of 3 February 1997, as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic for reproduction, due to their VOC content, and to which risk phrases R45, R46, R49, R60, R61 have been assigned, are used in the plant or in the activity.
5. This title, with the exception of what is provided for in paragraph 1, does not apply to the plants and activities listed in Part I of Annex IV to the fifth part of this decree. This title also does not apply to plants intended for national defense nor to emissions from vents and air changes exclusively used for the protection and safety of work environments. The relevant provisions of Articles 276 and 277 apply exclusively to fuel distribution plants.

**Art. 273**
**Large combustion plants**
1. Annex II to the fifth part of this decree establishes, in relation to large combustion plants, the emission limit values, including those for multi-fuel plants, the methods for monitoring and controlling emissions, the criteria for verifying compliance with the limit values, and the hypotheses of abnormal operation or malfunction of the plants.
2. The emission limit values of Part II, sections 1 to 5, letter B, and section 6 of Annex II to the fifth part of this decree apply to new large combustion plants.
3. The emission limit values of Part II, sections 1 to 5, letter A, and section 6 of Annex II to the fifth part of this decree apply to large combustion plants prior to 2006 starting from 1 January 2008. Until that date, Articles 3, paragraph 1, 6, paragraph 2, and 14, comma 3, nonché gli Allegati 4, 5, 6 e 9 del decreto del Ministro dell'ambiente 8 maggio 1989. Sono fatti salvi i diversi termini previsti nel suddetto Allegato II.
4. Ai grandi impianti di combustione anteriori al 1988 i valori limite di emissione di cui alla parte II, sezioni da 1 a 5, lettera A, e sezioni 6 e 7 dell'Allegato II alla parte quinta del presente decreto si applicano a partire dal 1° gennaio 2008. Fino a tale data si applicano i valori limite di emissione per il biossido di zolfo, gli ossidi di azoto, le polveri e per i metalli e loro composti previsti dal decreto del Ministro dell'ambiente 12 luglio 1990, o contenuti nelle autorizzazioni rilasciate ai sensi del decreto del Presidente della

Republic of May 24, 1988, no. 203, as well as the prescriptions relating to the anomalies of the abatement plants established in Annex II, part A, letter E, of the same ministerial decree. Until that date, the maximums and the emission reduction objectives, set in part V of Annex II to the fifth part of this decree, also apply. The different terms provided for in that Annex II are without prejudice.
5. The operators of the large combustion plants referred to in paragraph 4 may be exempted from the obligation to observe the emission limit values provided for in part II, sections 1 to 5, letter A, and section 6 of Annex II to the fifth part of this decree, on the basis of the procedure governed by part I of the same Annex II.
6. For the purposes of adapting the plants referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 to the emission limit values provided for therein, the operator, within the scope of the request for integrated environmental authorization, shall present to the competent authority a technical report containing the description of the plant, the technologies adopted to prevent pollution, and the quality and quantity of the emissions, from which compliance with the prescriptions of this title results, or an adaptation project aimed at respecting the same.
7. For plants with a nominal thermal power of 50 MW, the technical report or the adaptation project referred to in paragraph 6 must be submitted by August 1, 2007 and, in case of approval, the competent authority shall, pursuant to Article 269, update the existing authorizations.
8. In addition to what is provided for in Article 271, paragraph 14, the emission limit values do not apply to large combustion plants in cases of abnormal operation provided for in part I of Annex II to the fifth part of this decree, in compliance with the conditions provided therein.
9. In the event that the competent authority, when issuing the authorization, considers that two or more combustion plants, new or prior to 2006, also with a nominal thermal power of less than 50 MW, are installed at the same time and in such a way that the gaseous effluents, taking into account the technical and economic conditions, can be channelled towards a single chimney, the same considers the set of these new plants as a single plant whose nominal thermal power is equal to the sum of the nominal thermal powers of these plants. This provision applies only if the sum of the thermal powers is greater than or equal to 50 MW.
10. If a combustion plant is expanded with the construction of an additional plant having a nominal thermal power of 50 MW or more, to this additional plant, excluding the cases provided for in part I, paragraph 3, points 3.3 and 3.4, of Annex II to the fifth part of this decree, the emission limit values established in the same Annex II, sections 1 to 5, letter B, apply, as a function of the total thermal power of the two plants.
11. In the case where a large combustion plant is subject to modifications qualified as substantial by the current legislation on integrated environmental authorization, the emission limit values established in part II, sections 1 to 5, letter B, and section 6 of Annex II to the fifth part of this decree apply.
12. Without prejudice to what is provided for by the current legislation on integrated environmental authorization, for new plants or in the case of modifications pursuant to paragraph 11, the authorization application must be accompanied by a specific study concerning the technical and economic feasibility of the combined generation of heat and electricity. In the case where this feasibility is ascertained, also in light of elements other than those contained in the study, the competent authority, taking into account the market and distribution situation, shall condition the issuance of the authorization measure to the immediate or deferred realization of this solution.
13. After January 1, 2008, for combustion plants with a nominal thermal power of less than 50MW and for other plants excluded from the scope of application of the fifth part of this decree, which are part of a refinery, the emission limit values of part IV, paragraph 1, of Annex I to the fifth part of this decree shall continue to apply, without prejudice to what is provided for by the current legislation on integrated environmental authorization, calculated as a weighted ratio between the sum of the masses of pollutants emitted and the sum of the emission volumes of all the refinery's plants, including those falling within the scope of application of this article.

**Art. 275**
**VOC emissions**
1. Annex III to the fifth part of this decree establishes, with regard to volatile organic compound emissions, the emission limit values, the methods for monitoring and controlling emissions, the criteria for evaluating the conformity of the measured values to the limit values, and the methods for preparing the solvent management plan.
2. If in the same place one or more activities identified in part II of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree, which individually exceed the solvent consumption thresholds established therein, are carried out by means of one or more plants or machinery and non-fixed systems or manual operations, the limit values for channelled emissions and for diffuse emissions of the same Annex III, part III, or the total emission limit values of that Annex III, parts III and IV, as well as the prescriptions provided therein, shall apply to each of these activities. This provision also applies to activities which, in the same place, are directly and technically connected to the activities identified in the aforementioned Annex III, part II, and which may influence VOC emissions. The exceedance of the solvent consumption thresholds is evaluated with reference to the maximum theoretical solvent consumption authorized. The activities referred to in part II of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree include the cleaning of equipment and do not include the cleaning of products, without prejudice to the different provisions provided therein.
3. For the purposes of what is provided for in paragraph 2, the limit values for channelled emissions apply to each plant that produces such emissions, and the limit values for diffuse emissions apply to the sum of the non-channelled emissions of all the plants, of all the machinery and non-fixed systems, and of all the operations.
4. The operator who intends to carry out the activities referred to in paragraph 2 shall submit to the competent authority an authorization application in accordance with what is provided for in part I of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree. For this purpose, Article 269 shall apply, with the exception of paragraphs 2 and 4. In addition to the cases provided for by Article 269, paragraph 8, the authorization application must also be submitted by the operator of the activities who, as a result of a modification of the maximum theoretical solvent consumption, falls within those of paragraph 2.
5. The authorization covers the plants, machinery and non-fixed systems, and manual operations that carry out the activities of paragraph 2 and establishes, on the basis of that paragraph, the limit values that must be respected. Article 270 applies for capture and channelling. For emissions produced by machinery and non-fixed systems or by manual operations, paragraphs 10, 11, and 13 of Article 269 apply.
6. The authorization indicates the maximum theoretical solvent consumption and the total annual emission resulting from the application of the limit values of paragraph 2, identified on the

---
basis of this consumption, as well as the frequency of updating the management plan referred to in part V of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree.
7. Compliance with the emission limit values provided for in paragraph 2 is ensured through the application of the best available techniques and, in particular, by using raw materials with a low or zero content of organic solvents, optimizing the operation and management of the activities and, where necessary, installing suitable abatement devices, in order to minimize the emissions of volatile organic compounds.
8. If the activities of paragraph 2 are carried out by one or more plants authorized before March 13, 2004, or by such plants jointly with machinery and non-fixed systems or manual operations, the emissions must be adapted to the relevant prescriptions of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree and to the other prescriptions of this article by October 31, 2007, or, in case of adaptation to what is provided for by the same Annex III, part IV, within the dates established therein. Without prejudice to what is established by the current legislation on integrated environmental authorization, the adaptation is carried out on the basis of the projects submitted to the competent authority pursuant to the ministerial decree of January 14, 2004, no. 44. The plants thus authorized are considered to be prior to 2006. In case of failure to submit the project or of denial of the approval of the project by the competent authority, the activities are considered to be in operation without authorization. The adaptation terms provided for in this paragraph also apply to the plants of paragraph 20, in operation on March 12, 2004, whose operators adhere to the general authorization provided for therein within six months of the entry into force of the fifth part of this decree or have previously adhered to the general authorizations adopted pursuant to art. 9 of the decree of the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory of January 16, 2004, no. 44.
9. If the activities of paragraph 2 are carried out exclusively by machinery and non-fixed systems or by manual operations, in operation before the entry into force of the fifth part of this decree, the emissions must be adapted to the relevant prescriptions of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree and to the other prescriptions of this article by October 31, 2007. To this end, the authorization of paragraph 4 must be requested within six months of the date of entry into force of the fifth part of this decree. In case of failure to submit the request within this term, the activities are considered to be in operation without authorization.
10. Authorizations issued before March 13, 2004, which achieve greater containment of volatile organic compound emissions than that obtainable with the application of the indications of parts III and VI of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree, are without prejudice. In this case, the sampling and analysis methods previously in use remain valid. The right of the operator to request the competent authority to review these authorizations on the basis of the provisions of the fifth part of this decree is without prejudice.
11. The authorization application referred to in paragraph 4 must also be submitted by the operator of the activities referred to in paragraph 2, carried out pursuant to paragraphs 8 and 9, where the same are subject to substantial modifications. The authorization prescribes that the emissions of the plants, systems and non-fixed machinery, and manual operations subject to substantial modification:
a) are immediately adapted to the prescriptions of this article or
b) are adapted to the prescriptions of this article by October 31, 2007, if the total emissions of all the activities carried out by the operator in the same place do not exceed those that occur in the case of application of letter a).
12. If the operator proves to the competent authority that, despite using the best available technique, it is not possible to respect the limit value for diffuse emissions, this authority may authorize derogations from this limit value, provided that this does not entail risks to human health or the environment.
13. In the cases provided for in part III of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree, the competent authority may exempt the operator from applying the prescriptions established therein if the emissions cannot be channelled pursuant to Article 270, paragraphs 1 and 2. In this case, what is provided for in part IV of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree applies, unless the operator proves to the competent authority that compliance with this Annex is not, in the specific case, technically and economically feasible and that the plant uses the best available technique.
14. The competent authority shall communicate to the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory,

---
in the report referred to in paragraph 18, the derogations authorized pursuant to paragraphs 12 and 13.
15. If two or more activities carried out in the same place individually exceed the thresholds of paragraph 2, the competent authority may:
a) apply the limit values provided for by that paragraph to each single activity or
b) apply a total emission value, referring to the sum of the emissions of these activities, not higher than that which would be obtained by applying what is provided for in letter a); this option does not extend to the emissions of the substances indicated in paragraph 17.
16. The operator who, in the cases provided for by paragraph 8, uses an abatement device that allows compliance with an emission limit value of 50 mgC/Nm3, in case of combustion, and 150 mgC/Nm3, in all other cases, must respect the limit values for channelled emissions of part III of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree by April 1, 2013, provided that the total emissions do not exceed those that would have been produced in case of application of the prescriptions of part III of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree.
17. Part I of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree establishes specific emission limit values for substances characterized by particular risks to health and the environment.
18. The competent authorities shall transmit to the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, every three years and by April 30, starting from 2005, a report on the application of this article, in accordance with what is provided for by decision 2002/529/EC of June 27, 2002 of the European Commission. A copy of the report is sent by the competent authorities to the region or autonomous province. The Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory sends this information to the European Commission.
19. For VOC emissions from plants prior to 1988, regulated by this article, the limit values and prescriptions of Annex I to the fifth part of this decree shall apply until the dates provided for in paragraphs 8 and 9 or until the date of effective adaptation of the plants, if earlier.
20. The operators of closed-cycle plants for dry cleaning of fabrics and furs, excluding furs, and of closed-cycle laundries, for which the competent authority has not adopted general authorizations, shall communicate to such authorities their adhesion to the authorization of part VII of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree. The power of the same authorities to subsequently adopt new general authorizations, pursuant to Article 272, the adhesion to which entails, for the interested party, the lapse of that provided for in part VII of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree with respect to the territory to which such new authorizations refer, is without prejudice. The prescriptions of part I, paragraph 3, points 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree do not apply to such activities.
21. The following constitutes a substantial modification, pursuant to this article:
a) for small-scale activities, a modification of the maximum theoretical solvent consumption that entails an increase in volatile organic compound emissions by more than twenty-five percent;
b) for all other activities, a modification of the maximum theoretical solvent consumption that entails an increase in volatile organic compound emissions by more than ten percent;
c) any modification which, in the opinion of the competent authority, could have significant negative effects on human health or the environment;
d) any modification of the maximum theoretical solvent consumption that entails a change in the applicable limit values;
22. For small-scale activities, pursuant to paragraph 21, the activities referred to in part III, points 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, or 17 of Annex III to the fifth part of this decree having a maximum theoretical solvent consumption less than or equal to the lower of the consumption thresholds indicated therein in the third column and the other activities of part III of the same Annex III having a maximum theoretical solvent consumption of less than 10 tons per year are intended.

3. The Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, for the ascertainment of the causes of the damage and for its quantification, to be carried out in application of the provisions contained in Annexes 3 and 4 to the sixth part of this decree, may order, in compliance with the principle of contradiction with the interested operator, a specific technical consultancy carried out by the ministerial offices, by those of paragraph 2 or, taking into account the financial resources provided for by current legislation, by independent professionals.
4. The Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, in order to carry out documentary inspections, verifications, and searches, including in computer equipment, and any other survey deemed useful for the ascertainment of the harmful fact and for the identification of the transgressors, may order the access of his own appointees to the site affected by the harmful fact.

**Art. 313**
**Ordinance**
1. If, at the end of the preliminary investigation of Article 312, a fact has been ascertained that has caused environmental damage and the person responsible has not activated the restoration procedures pursuant to title V of the fourth part of this decree or pursuant to Articles 304 and following, the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, with an immediately enforceable ordinance, shall order those who, on the basis of the said ascertainment, have been found responsible for the fact, the environmental restoration by way of compensation in specific form within a fixed term.
2. If the person responsible for the fact that has caused environmental damage does not provide for the restoration in whole or in part within the ordered term, or the restoration is in whole or in part impossible, or excessively burdensome pursuant to Article 2058 of the civil code, the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, with a subsequent ordinance, shall order the payment, within sixty days of notification, of a sum equal to the economic value of the ascertained or residual damage, by way of compensation for pecuniary equivalent.

---
3. With regard to compensation for damage in specific form, the ordinance is issued against the person responsible for the harmful act as well as, jointly and severally, against the person in whose effective interest the conduct causing the damage was held or who objectively benefited from it, avoiding, according to the completed investigation, the economic burden necessary to prepare, in a preventive manner, the works, equipment, precautions, and to maintain the behaviors provided for as mandatory by the applicable rules.
4. The ordinance is adopted within the peremptory term of one hundred and eighty days starting from the communication to the subjects of paragraph 3 of the start of the investigation, and in any case within the term of forfeiture of two years from the notice of the fact, unless the environmental restoration is in progress by the care and expense of the transgressor. In this case, the same terms start from the unjustified suspension of the restoration works or from their conclusion in case of incomplete repair of the damage. The Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory shall provide for the attestations concerning the suspension of the works and their incompleteness with a specific act of ascertainment.
5. Within the terms provided for by paragraphs 1 and 3 of art. 2947 of the civil code, the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory may adopt further measures against subsequently identified transgressors.
6. In the case of damage caused by subjects subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Auditors, the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, instead of ordering the payment of the compensation for patrimonial equivalent, shall send a report to the Regional Prosecutor's Office at the jurisdictional Section of the Court of Auditors competent for the territory.
7. In the case of occurred compensation for the damage, new interventions involving an increase in costs for the interested operator are excluded, following a concurrent action by an authority other than the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory. The right of the subjects damaged by the fact that produced environmental damage, in their health or in their property, to take legal action against the person responsible for the protection of their rights and interests remains unaffected.

**Art. 314**
**Content of the ordinance**
1. The ordinance contains the specific indication of the fact, commissive or omissive, contested, as well as the elements of fact considered relevant for the identification and quantification of the damage and the sources of evidence for the identification of the transgressors.
2. The ordinance shall fix a term, also agreed upon with the transgressor in application of art. 11 of law no. 241 of 7 August 1990, for the restoration of the state of the places at his expense, in any case not less than two months and not more than two years, unless a further extension is to be defined in consideration of the extent of the necessary works.
3. The quantification of the damage must include the prejudice caused to the environmental situation with particular reference to the cost necessary for its restoration. Where the exact quantification of the damage not compensable in specific form, or part of it, is not motivably possible, the damage for patrimonial equivalent is presumed, until proven otherwise, to amount to not less than three times the sum corresponding to the administrative pecuniary sanction, or to the criminal sanction, in concrete applied. If a custodial sentence has been served, for the purpose of quantifying the damage of this article, the conversion between it and the sum to be charged as compensation for the damage takes place by calculating four hundred euros for each day of custodial sentence.
4. In case of a conviction sentence in criminal proceedings or the issuance of the measure of Article 444 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the chancellery of the judge who issued the sentence or the measure shall transmit a copy of the same to the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory within five days of their publication.
5. The regions, the autonomous provinces, and the other territorial entities, for the purpose of compensation for environmental damage, shall communicate to the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory the administrative sanctions, within ten days of their imposition.
6. The ministerial ordinances of Articles 304, paragraph 3, and 313 indicate the means of appeal and the relative terms.

**Art. 315**

**Art. 316**
**Appeal against the ordinance**
1. The transgressor, within the peremptory term of sixty days from the communication of the ordinance of Article 313, may appeal to the regional administrative Tribunal, in exclusive jurisdiction, competent in relation to the place where the environmental damage occurred.
2. The transgressor may precede the jurisdictional action with the opposition appeal of Article 310, paragraphs 2 and 3.

2. In the ordinance or in the sentence, it may be ordered, upon request of the interested party who is in difficult economic conditions, that the amounts due be paid in monthly installments not exceeding the number of twenty; each installment cannot in any case be less than five thousand euros.
3. At any time, the debt can be extinguished by a single payment.
4. The failure to pay even a single installment on its due date entails the obligation to pay the remaining amount in a single solution.
5. The sums deriving from the collection of credits in favor of the State for the compensation of environmental damage regulated by the sixth part of this decree, including those deriving from the enforcement of guarantees in favor of the State, assumed as a guarantee of the same compensation, are paid into the State budget, to be reallocated within sixty days, by decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance, to a revolving fund established within a specific basic forecast unit of the budget forecast of the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, in order to finance, also by way of advance and, in the latter case, to the maximum extent of ten percent of the expenditure:

b) decontamination, remediation, and environmental restoration interventions of the areas for which compensation for environmental damage has taken place;
c) remediation and environmental restoration interventions provided for in the national program for the remediation and environmental restoration of polluted sites;
d) activities of the research centers in the field of reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change.
6. By decree of the Minister of the Environment and Protection of the Territory, adopted in concert with the Minister of Economy and Finance, the operating and access methods to the aforesaid revolving fund are regulated, including the procedures for the recovery of the sums granted by way of advance.
