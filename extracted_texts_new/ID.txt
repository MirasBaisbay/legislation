LAW OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
NUMBER 17 OF 2019
CONCERNING
WATER RESOURCES

I. GENERAL

Water is a basic necessity for human life bestowed by God Almighty upon the entire Indonesian nation. Water as a part of Water Resources is a vital branch of production that affects the lives of many people and is controlled by the state to be used for the greatest prosperity of the people in accordance with the mandate of Article 33 paragraph (2) and paragraph (3) of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. In that article, it is stated that the earth, water, and the natural resources contained therein are controlled by the state and are used for the greatest prosperity of the people. Therefore, the formulation of the Law concerning Water Resources must be aimed at optimizing the Management of Water Resources to achieve the mandate of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia.

Water is a very important necessity for life. With the imbalance between the availability of Water, which tends to decrease, and the demand for Water, which is increasing, water resources must be managed by considering social, environmental, and economic functions in a harmonious manner to create synergy and integration between regions, sectors, and generations to fulfill the people's need for Water.

Since its enactment in 2004, Law Number 7 of 2004 concerning Water Resources has been subjected to judicial review at the Constitutional Court several times, namely Case Number 058-059-060-063/PUU-II/2004, Case Number 008/PUU-III/2005 dated July 19, 2005, and Case Number 85/PUU-XI/2013 dated February 18, 2015. Ultimately, the Decision of the Constitutional Court Number 85/PUU-IX/2013 revoked the validity of Law Number 7 of 2004 concerning Water Resources and reinstated Law Number 11 of 1974 concerning Irrigation, which in reality is no longer in accordance with the current conditions of Water Resources Management.

The re-enacted Law on Irrigation still has many shortcomings and is not yet able to comprehensively regulate the Management of Water Resources in accordance with the developments and legal needs of the community today, and thus it needs to be replaced.

The regulation concerning Water Resources is made so that the Management of Water Resources is organized based on the principles of public benefit, affordability, justice, balance, self-reliance, local wisdom, environmental insight, preservation, sustainability, integration and harmony, as well as transparency and accountability. The regulation of Water Resources aims to provide protection and guarantee the fulfillment of the people's right to Water; guarantee the sustainable availability of Water and Water Sources to provide benefits to the community in a just manner; guarantee the preservation of the function of Water and Water Sources to support sustainable development; guarantee the creation of legal certainty for the implementation of community participation in overseeing the utilization of Water Resources starting from Planning, implementation, and evaluation of utilization; guarantee the protection and empowerment of the community, including Indigenous Peoples, in the effort of Water Resources conservation and utilization; and control the Destructive Force of Water.

The principal materials regulated in this Law concerning Water Resources include state control and the people's right to Water; the authority and responsibility of the Central Government and Regional Governments in the Management of Water Resources; Management of Water Resources; permitting for the use of Water Resources; the water resources information system; empowerment and supervision; funding; rights and obligations; community participation; and coordination. In addition, provisions concerning investigation and criminal provisions for violations of the provisions in this Law are also regulated.

This Law expressly states that Water Resources are controlled by the state and used for the greatest prosperity of the people. For that, the state guarantees the people's right to Water to meet the minimum basic daily needs for a healthy and clean life with a sufficient quantity, good quality, safety, sustained continuity, and affordability. In addition, the state prioritizes the people's right to Water for (1) basic daily needs, (2) smallholder agriculture, (3) business needs to meet basic daily needs through the Drinking Water Supply System, (4) non-business activities for the public interest; and (5) other business needs for which a permit has been established.

The limited availability of Water Resources on one hand and the increasing demand for Water on the other hand give rise to competition among users of Water Resources, which has an impact on the strengthening of the economic value of Water. This condition has the potential to cause conflicts of interest between sectors, between regions, and between various parties related to Water Resources. For that, regulations are needed that can provide protection for the interests of the community to meet basic daily needs and irrigation for smallholder agriculture. Therefore, the provision of Water to meet basic daily needs and irrigation for smallholder agriculture in the existing irrigation system is the main priority above all other Water needs.

Based on state control over Water Resources, the Central Government and/or Regional Governments are given the duty and authority to regulate and manage Water Resources, including the duty to fulfill the minimum basic daily needs for Water for the community. In addition, this Law also provides authority for Water Resources Management to the village government, or what is known by another name, to assist the government in the Management of Water Resources and to encourage the initiative and participation of the village community in the Management of Water Resources in its territory.

A portion of the duties and authorities of the Central Government and/or Regional Governments in managing Water Resources covering one River Basin may be assigned to a Water Resources Manager, which may be in the form of a ministerial technical implementation unit/regional technical implementation unit or a state-owned enterprise/regionally-owned enterprise in the field of Water Resources Management.

The existence of Water as a source of community life, naturally, is dynamic and flows to a lower place without recognizing administrative boundaries. The existence of Water follows the hydrological cycle, which is closely related to weather conditions in a region, thus causing the availability of water to be uneven in every time and every region. This requires that the Management of Water Resources be carried out holistically from upstream to downstream on a River Basin basis.

Based on this, the regulation of the authority and responsibility for the Management of Water Resources by the Central Government, provincial governments, and regency/city governments is based on the existence of the River Basin. To achieve integrated management of Water Resources, a joint reference needs to be formulated for stakeholders in one river basin in the form of a Water Resources Management Master Plan with the principle of integration between Surface Water and Groundwater. The Water Resources Management Master Plan is formulated in a coordinated manner among relevant agencies.

The Water Resources Management Master Plan is then elaborated into the Water Resources Management Plan. The Water Resources Management Plan is the master plan for Water Resources Conservation, Water Resources Utilization, and Control of the Destructive Force of Water, which is formulated in a coordinated manner and is based on the River Basin. The plan becomes the basis for the formulation of the Water Resources Management program, which is further elaborated in the activity plan of each relevant agency.

In principle, the use of Water Resources to meet basic daily needs and for smallholder agriculture can be carried out without a permit for the use of Water Resources for non-business needs. However, in the case that the use of Water Resources to meet basic daily needs involves changing the natural condition of the Water Source or is intended for the needs of a group that requires Water in a large quantity, its use must be based on a permit for the use of Water Resources for non-business needs. The use of Water to meet the needs of irrigation for smallholder agriculture must also be based on a permit for the use of Water Resources for non-business needs if it is done by changing the natural condition of the Water Source or is used for smallholder agriculture outside the existing irrigation system.

All types and forms of use and development of Water Resources for business activities must be carried out based on a permit for the use of Water Resources for business needs. The amount of the Water quota specified in the permit is the maximum volume of Water that can be given to the permit holder, which is not absolute and does not constitute a permit to control the Water Source.

The use of Water Resources for business needs is organized by observing the principles of (a) not disturbing, not overriding, and not negating the people's right to Water; (b) state protection of the people's right to Water; (c) preservation of the living environment as a human right; (d) absolute state supervision and control over Water; (e) primary priority for the use of Water Resources for business activities is given to state-owned enterprises, regionally-owned enterprises, or village-owned enterprises; and (f) the granting of a Permit for the Use of Water Resources for business needs to the private sector may be carried out with specific and strict conditions after the principles as referred to in letters a through e are fulfilled and there is still water availability.

The use of Water Resources for business needs is aimed at increasing the benefits of Water Resources for the welfare of the people by prioritizing the public interest and still paying attention to the social function of Water Resources and the preservation of the living environment. The use of Water Resources for business activities at a certain place can be granted to a state-owned enterprise or a regionally-owned enterprise, a private business entity, and/or an individual based on the plan for the implementation of the business activity that has been formulated through public consultation and a permit for the use of Water Resources for business needs from the government.

The use of Water Resources for such business activities can be in the form of using Water Resources for business activities that require raw Water as a production raw material, as one of the media or main elements of a business activity, such as regional drinking water companies, bottled drinking water companies, hydroelectric power plants, rafting sports, and as an auxiliary material in the production process, such as Water for a machine cooling system or Water for washing mining exploration products. The use of Water Resources for business activities does not include the control of the Water Source, but is limited to the use of Water in accordance with the established Water quota and the use of a part of the Water Source for the needs of the required infrastructure facilities, for example, the use of Water Resources for the business activity of building infrastructure facilities at the Water Source.

For the sustainable implementation of Water Resources Management, the beneficiaries of Water Resources Management services, in principle, are obliged to bear the management costs in accordance with the benefits received. This obligation does not apply to users of Water for basic daily needs, smallholder agriculture, and activities other than to meet basic daily needs and smallholder agriculture that are not business activities.

The Management of Water Resources involves the interests of many parties who are often not aligned and create potential conflicts. To address this, coordination is needed to integrate the interests of inter-sectoral and inter-regional parties and to formulate Water Resources Management activities in a synergistic manner.

Coordination at the national, provincial, and regency/city levels is necessary in the formulation of Water Resources Management policies. At the River Basin level, coordination needs to be carried out related to operational activities that involve various interests. Coordination at the River Basin level needs to be accommodated in a permanent institution in the form of a coordination forum at the River Basin level.

To ensure the certainty and enforcement of the law in matters related to the Management of Water Resources, in addition to investigators from the National Police of the Republic of Indonesia, it is necessary to have civil servant investigators who are given the authority for investigation.
