"The Water Authority" is obliged to personally notify the applicants of the resolution on the respective applications referred to in this Chapter, in accordance with the period established in Article 22 of this Law and the procedure established in Article 35 of the Federal Law of Administrative Procedure. If the authority fails to inform the applicant of the resolution on their application, it shall be considered that it has resolved to deny the request. The lack of a resolution to the application may imply responsibilities for the public servants to whom such resolution corresponds, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws. Article amended OG 04-29-2004 ARTICLE 25. Once the title of concession or assignment has been granted, the concessionaire or assignee shall have the right to exploit, use, or appropriate the national waters during the term of the concession or assignment, in accordance with the provisions of this Law and its regulations.

Otherwise, prior authorization from "the Water Authority" will be required. Authorization will always be necessary when the consumptive use established in the corresponding title is altered, the point of extraction, the discharge site, or the volume or quality of the wastewater is modified. The application for authorization referred to in the preceding paragraph must state the data of the concession title, the type of variation or modification to the use in question; those inherent to the modification of the point of extraction, the discharge site, and the quality of the wastewater, the alteration of the consumptive use, and the modification of the volume of water granted by concession or assignment, which may not be greater than that granted by concession or assignment; if applicable, it will be necessary to present the evaluation of the environmental impact, under the terms of the Law.
