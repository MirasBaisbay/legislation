with assistance given in the later stage, makes proper arrangements 
for production and daily lives of the relocated people and protects their 
legitimate rights and interests.
Arrangements for relocated people shall be made simultaneously with 
the construction of the projects. The unit launching the construction 
project shall, on the basis of the ambient capacity of the places where 
people are to be located and the principle of sustainable development, 
work out a plan for arrangements to be made for such people in light of 
the local conditions, which, upon approval in accordance with law, shall 
be implemented through arrangement by the local people’s government 
concerned. Funds needed for relocation of people shall be included in the 
investment plan for construction of the project.
