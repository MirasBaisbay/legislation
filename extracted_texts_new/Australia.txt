Matter to be included 
Specific requirements 
1 
A description of the Basin water 
resources and the context in 
which those resources are used. 
The description must include information 
about: 
(a) the size, extent, connectivity, variability 
and condition of the Basin water 
resources; and 
(b) the uses to which the Basin water 
resources are put (including by 
Indigenous people); and 
(c) the users of the Basin water resources; 
and 
(d) the social and economic circumstances of 
Basin communities dependent on the 
Basin water resources. 
2 
An identification of the 
particular areas that are to be 
water resource plan areas for 
the purposes of this Act and the 
periods that are to be the water 
accounting periods for each of 
those areas. 
The Basin Plan may also 
provide that an area is to be a 
water resource plan area for the 
purposes of this Act from the 
time specified in the Basin Plan. 
The time may be specified as a 
particular date, as the time when 
particular conditions are 
satisfied or particular 
circumstances start to exist or in 
any other way. If the Basin Plan 
includes a provision to this 
effect, the area is a water 
resource plan area only from the 
time specified in the Basin Plan. 
The identification must specify one or more 
of the following as the water resources to 
which any water resource plan for the area 
will apply: 
(a) all (or a specified part or share) of the 
surface water in a particular area; 
(b) all (or a specified part or share) of the 
ground water beneath a particular area; 
(c) all (or a specified part) of a particular 
watercourse, lake or aquifer. 
A reference in this Act to the water resources 
of the water resource plan area is a reference 
to the water resources identified as the ones 
to which the water resource plan applies. 
The water resource plan areas in a State, and 
the water accounting periods for those areas, 
that are identified in the Basin Plan must, as 
far as possible, be aligned with the areas and 
accounting periods provided for in or under 
the State water management law of that State. 
However, this does not prevent the Basin 
Plan identifying an area as a water resource 
plan area if none of that area falls within an

(4) The requirements referred to in a paragraph in subsection (3) need 
not apply in relation to the water resource plan for a water resource 
plan area if those requirements are not relevant to the water 
resource plan area given the management objectives for the area. 
Note: 
If the management objective for the area is to preserve the natural 
values of a river system through no development, some of the 
requirements that relate to the use and management of the water 
resources of the water resource plan area may be irrelevant. 
 
(5) The requirements specified under item 11 of the table in 
subsection (1) may include a requirement for a water resource plan 
to provide for the metering of stock and domestic water use only to 
the extent that such metering is necessary for the effective 
management of the Basin water resources. 
Note: 
Metering may, for example, be necessary for the effective 
management of the Basin water resources where a particular ground 
water resource is under stress or where there are local disputes about 
water sharing. 
 
(6) To avoid doubt: 
 
(a) there may be different requirements under item 11 of the 
table in subsection (1) for different kinds of water resource 
plan areas or to meet different management objectives; and 
 
(b) a requirement under that item may be one that, in accordance 
with its terms, does not apply to a particular water resource 
plan area or applies only to a limited extent. 
Adjustments to long-term annual diversion limits 
 
(6A) The requirements in paragraph (3)(b) must include a requirement 
for a water resource plan for a water resource plan area to contain a 
mechanism for incorporating and applying the long-term annual 
diversion limit for the water resources of that plan area (or for a 
particular part of those water resources), as that limit is after it has 
been amended to take account of a relevant SDL adjustment.

may be taken from those water resources.

Division 4—Allocation of risks in relation to reductions in 
water availability 
Subdivision A—Risks arising from reductions in diversion 
limits 
74  Simplified outline 
 
(1) This section provides a simplified outline of this Subdivision. 
 
(2) When the long-term average sustainable diversion limit for the 
water resources of a water resource plan area (or for a particular 
part of those water resources) is reduced, the Basin Plan identifies 
the Commonwealth’s share (if any) of the reduction. 
Note 1: 
The Commonwealth’s share includes reductions attributable to 
changes in Commonwealth Government policy and may also include 
some part of reductions attributable to improvements in knowledge 
about the environmentally sustainable level of take for the water 
resources of a water resource plan area. 
Note 2: 
See section 75. 
 
(3) The Commonwealth: 
 
(a) endeavours to manage the impact of the Commonwealth’s 
share of the reduction on the holders of water access 
entitlements; and 
 
(b) may take steps to ensure that the holders of water access 
entitlements do not suffer a reduction in their water 
allocations as a result of the Commonwealth’s share of the 
reduction. 
Note: 
See section 76. 
 
(4) A water access entitlement holder is entitled to a payment if 
(despite the Commonwealth’s efforts) there is a reduction in, or a 
change in the reliability of, the holder’s water allocations that is 
reasonably attributable to the Commonwealth’s share of the 
reduction in the long-term average sustainable diversion limit (and 
if certain other conditions are met).

74A  States applying the risk assignment framework 
 
(1) The Minister must, in writing, determine that a Basin State is a 
State to which this section applies if the Minister is satisfied that a 
State water management law of the State: 
 
(a) has applied the risk assignment framework provided for in 
clauses 48 to 50 of the National Water Initiative, read in 
conjunction with clause 10.1.3 of the Agreement on 
Murray-Darling Basin Reform of 3 July 2008; and 
 
(b) has applied that framework by, and at all times since: 
 
(i) 30 June 2009; or 
 
(ii) a later day specified in the regulations. 
Note: 
Clauses 48 to 50 of the National Water Initiative and clause 10.1.3 of 
the Agreement on Murray-Darling Basin Reform of 3 July 2008 are 
set out in Schedule 3A. 
 
(2) The day specified in regulations made for the purposes of 
subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) must not be later than the day on which the 
Basin Plan first takes effect. 
 
(2A) The Minister is taken, on the commencement of this section, to 
have made a determination under subsection (1) that New South 
Wales is a State to which this section applies. 
 
(3) The Minister must, in writing, revoke a determination made under 
subsection (1) if satisfied that there is no longer a State water 
management law of the State that gives effect to that framework. 
 
(5) A determination made under subsection (1), or a revocation under 
subsection (3), is not a legislative instrument. 
75  Basin Plan to specify Commonwealth share of reduction in 
long-term average sustainable diversion limit 
 
(1) If the long-term average sustainable diversion limit for the water 
resources of a water resource plan area (or for a particular part of 
those water resources) is reduced, the Basin Plan must specify:

 If the Basin Plan specifies, under subsection 75(1), the 
Commonwealth’s share of a reduction in the long-term average 
sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of a water 
resource plan area, or for the particular part of those water 
resources, the Commonwealth: 
 
(a) must endeavour to manage the impact of the 
Commonwealth’s share of the reduction in the limit on the 
holders of water access entitlements; and 
 
(b) may take steps to ensure that the holders of water access 
entitlements do not suffer a reduction in their water 
allocations, or a change in the reliability of their water 
allocations, as a result of the Commonwealth’s share of the 
reduction in the limit. 
Note 1: 
This subsection implements in part the policy in clauses 49 and 50 of 
the National Water Initiative. 
Note 2: 
If a reduction in, or a change in the reliability of, a water allocation 
results despite the steps taken by the Commonwealth, the 
Commonwealth may be liable for an amount under section 77.

Part 2  Management of Basin water resources 
Division 4  Allocation of risks in relation to reductions in water availability 
 
Section 80

Compilation No. 29 
Compilation date: 01/09/2021

Subdivision B—Risks arising from other changes to Basin Plan 
80  Simplified outline 
 
(1) This section provides a simplified outline of this Subdivision. 
 
(2) When a change to the Basin Plan would result in a change in the 
reliability of the water allocations in relation to the water resources 
of a water resource plan area, the Basin Plan identifies the change 
and may also specify the Commonwealth’s share (if any) of that 
change in reliability. 
Note 1: 
The Commonwealth’s share is worked out in accordance with the 
provisions of the National Water Initiative. The Initiative provides that 
the Commonwealth’s share includes changes attributable to changes in 
Commonwealth Government policy and, for changes that occur on or 
after 1 January 2015, may also include some part of changes 
attributable to improvements in knowledge about the environmentally 
sustainable level of take for the water resources of a water resource 
plan area. 
Note 2: 
See section 81. 
 
(3) The Commonwealth: 
 
(a) endeavours to manage the impact of the Commonwealth’s 
share of the potential change in reliability on the holders of 
water access entitlements; and 
 
(b) may take steps to ensure that the holders of water access 
entitlements do not suffer a change in the reliability of their 
water allocations as a result of the Commonwealth’s share of 
the potential change. 
Note: 
See section 82. 
 
(4) If, despite the Commonwealth’s efforts, there is a change in the 
reliability of the water allocations of a holder of a water access 
entitlement and the change is reasonably attributable to the 
Commonwealth’s share of the change in reliability, the holder may 
be entitled to a payment under section 83.

81  Basin Plan to specify certain matters if Plan results in change in 
reliability of water allocations 
 
(1) This section applies if: 
 
(a) a change to the Basin Plan would, if action were not to be 
taken under this Subdivision, result in a change in the 
reliability of water allocations in relation to the water 
resources of a water resource plan area; and 
 
(b) this would occur otherwise than because of a reduction in the 
long-term average sustainable diversion limit for those water 
resources (or for a part of those water resources). 
 
(2) The Basin Plan must: 
 
(a) specify that this Subdivision applies to that change to the 
Basin Plan; and 
 
(b) specify the nature of the change in the reliability of those 
water allocations. 
 
(3) The Basin Plan may specify the following: 
 
(a) the extent (if any) to which the change in reliability is 
attributable to changes in Commonwealth Government policy 
(the Commonwealth Government policy component of the 
change in reliability); 
 
(b) the extent (if any) to which the change in reliability is 
attributable to improvements in knowledge about the 
environmentally sustainable level of take for the water 
resources of the water resource plan area (the new knowledge 
component of the change in reliability); 
 
(c) the extent (if any) of the Commonwealth’s share of the 
change in reliability. 
 
(3A) In working out the amount of the Commonwealth Government 
policy component or the new knowledge component, any reduction 
that is a result of matters referred to in clause 48 of the National 
Water Initiative is to be disregarded. 
Note: 
Clause 48 of the National Water Initiative is set out in Part 1 of 
Schedule 3A.

82  Commonwealth to manage Commonwealth share of change in 
reliability 
 
 If the Basin Plan specifies, under paragraph 81(3)(c), the 
Commonwealth’s share of a change in the reliability of the water 
allocations in relation to the water resources of a water resource 
plan area, the Commonwealth: 
 
(a) must endeavour to manage the impact of the 
Commonwealth’s share of the change in reliability on the 
holders of water access entitlements; and 
 
(b) may take steps to ensure that the holders of water access 
entitlements do not suffer a change in the reliability of their 
water allocations as a result of the Commonwealth’s share of 
the change in reliability. 
Note 1: 
This subsection implements in part the policy in clauses 49 and 50 of 
the National Water Initiative. 
Note 2: 
If a change in the reliability of water allocations results despite the 
steps taken by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth may be liable 
for an amount under section 83. 
83  Payments to water access entitlement holders 
Qualification for payment under this section 
 
(1) A person (the entitlement holder) qualifies for a payment under 
this section if:

particular time; 
the substitute entitlement is taken, for the purposes of applying 
paragraph (1)(b), to have been granted, issued or authorised at the 
time when the earlier right was granted, issued or authorised. 
Note: 
This means, for example, that if the earlier right was granted, issued or 
authorised before 25 January 2007, the substitute entitlement is also 
taken to have been granted, issued or authorised before 25 January 
2007.

(1) The object of this Part is to enhance the environmental outcomes 
that can be achieved by the Basin Plan, as in force from time to 
time, by: 
 
(a) protecting and restoring the environmental assets of the 
Murray-Darling Basin; and 
 
(b) protecting biodiversity dependent on the Basin water 
resources; 
so as to give effect to relevant international agreements. 
 
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), environmental outcomes can be 
enhanced in the following ways: 
 
(a) further reducing salinity levels in the Coorong and Lower 
Lakes so that improved water quality contributes to the 
health of insects, fish and plants that form important parts of 
the food chain, with the aim of achieving the following 
outcomes: 
 
(i) the maximum average daily salinity in the Coorong 
South Lagoon is less than 100 grams per litre; 
 
(ii) the maximum average daily salinity in the Coorong 
North Lagoon is less than 50 grams per litre; 
 
(iii) the average daily salinity in Lake Alexandrina is less 
than 1000 microsiemens per centimetre for 95% of 
years and 1500 microsiemens per centimetre all of the 
time; 
 
(b) keeping water levels in the Lower Lakes above: 
 
(i) 0.4 metres Australian Height Datum for 95% of the 
time; and

Murray-Darling Basin as a long-term average; 
 
(e) further increasing flows to the Coorong through the Murray 
Mouth Barrages, and supporting fish migration; 
 
(f) in conjunction with removing or easing constraints referred 
to in subparagraph (h)(ii), providing opportunities for 
environmental watering of an additional 35,000 hectares of 
floodplains in the River Murray System, to do the following: 
 
(i) improve the health of forests and the habitats of fish and 
birds; 
 
(ii) improve connections between the floodplains and rivers 
in the River Murray System; 
 
(iii) replenish groundwater; 
 
(g) increasing the flows of rivers and streams, and providing 
water to low and middle level floodplains and habitats that 
are adjacent to rivers and streams, in the River Murray 
System: 
 
(i) to enhance environmental outcomes within those 
floodplains, habitats, rivers and streams; and 
 
(ii) to improve connections between those floodplains and 
habitats, and those rivers and streams; 
 
(h) in any other way that is consistent with: 
 
(i) the Authority’s modelling of the effect of increasing the 
volume of the Basin water resources that is available for 
environmental use by 3200 gigalitres; and 
 
(ii) easing or removing constraints on the capacity to deliver 
environmental water to the environmental assets of the

Part 2A—Critical human water needs 
   
86A  Critical human water needs to be taken into account in 
developing Basin Plan 
 
(1) Without limiting section 21, the Basin Plan must be prepared 
having regard to the fact that the Commonwealth and the Basin 
States have agreed: 
 
(a) that critical human water needs are the highest priority water 
use for communities who are dependent on Basin water 
resources; and 
 
(b) in particular that, to give effect to this priority in the River 
Murray System, conveyance water will receive first priority 
from the water available in the system. 
 
(2) Critical human water needs are the needs for a minimum amount 
of water, that can only reasonably be provided from Basin water 
resources, required to meet: 
 
(a) core human consumption requirements in urban and rural 
areas; and 
 
(b) those non-human consumption requirements that a failure to 
meet would cause prohibitively high social, economic or 
national security costs. 
 
(3) The River Murray System is the aggregate of: 
 
(a) the main course of the River Murray upstream of the eastern 
boundary of South Australia; and 
 
(b) all tributaries entering that part of the main course upstream 
of Doctors Point (near Albury); and 
 
(c) all effluents and anabranches of that part of the main course; 
and 
 
(d) the watercourses connecting Lake Victoria to the main 
course; and 
 
(e) the Darling River downstream of the Menindee Lakes 
Storage; and

(f) the upper River Murray storages, namely: 
 
(i) Lake Victoria; and 
 
(ii) the Menindee Lakes Storage; and 
 
(iii) the storages formed by Dartmouth Dam and Hume 
Dam; and 
 
(iv) the storages formed by the weirs, and weirs and locks, 
described in Schedule A to the Agreement that are 
upstream of the eastern boundary of South Australia; 
and 
 
(g) the River Murray in South Australia. 
 
(4) Conveyance water is water in the River Murray System required to 
deliver water to meet critical human water needs as far downstream 
as Wellington in South Australia. 
86B  Basin Plan to provide for critical human water needs 
 
(1) The Basin Plan must: 
 
(a) include a statement of the amount of water required in each 
Basin State that is a referring State (other than Queensland) 
to meet the critical human water needs of the communities in 
the State that are dependent on the waters of the River 
Murray System; and 
 
(b) include a statement of the amount of conveyance water 
required to deliver the water referred to in paragraph (a); and 
 
(c) specify water quality trigger points and salinity trigger points 
at which water in the River Murray System becomes 
unsuitable for meeting critical human water needs. 
 
(2) The reference in paragraph (1)(a) to communities in a Basin State 
who are dependent on the waters of the River Murray System does 
not include a reference to communities dependent on the waters of 
the Edward-Wakool System downstream of Stevens Weir.

86C  Additional matters relating to monitoring, assessment and risk 
management 
 
(1) The Basin Plan must also specify: 
 
(a) arrangements for monitoring matters relevant to critical 
human water needs, including monitoring the quality, 
quantity and flows of surface water, the health of ecosystems 
and social impacts on communities; and 
 
(b) the process for assessing, and managing risks to critical 
human water needs associated with, inflow prediction: 
 
(i) in the River Murray System; and 
 
(ii) in relation to works that are under the control of the 
body that is entitled, under the Snowy Hydro 
Corporatisation Act 1997 of New South Wales, to the 
Snowy water licence within the meaning of that Act; 
and 
 
(c) the risk management approach for inter-annual planning 
relating to arrangements for critical human water needs in 
future years. 
 
(2) The risk management approach referred to in paragraph (1)(c) must 
address the making of decisions about whether water is: 
 
(a) made available, in a particular year, for uses other than 
meeting critical human water needs; or 
 
(b) set aside for critical human water needs in future years. 
86D  Additional matters relating to Tier 2 water sharing 
arrangements 
 
(1) The Basin Plan must also: 
 
(a) specify the conditions under which, due to the likelihood that 
the State water sharing arrangements that would apply but for 
this Part (Tier 1 water sharing arrangements) will not 
ensure that there is enough water to meet conveyance water 
needs: 
 
(i) the Tier 1 water sharing arrangements cease to apply;

of subparagraph (1)(c)(i) by subtracting: 
 
(a) the amount of conveyance water referred to in 
paragraph 86B(1)(b); from 
 
(b) the minimum inflow sequence to the River Murray System 
from: 
 
(i) natural flows; and

97  Water market rules 
 
(1) The Minister may make rules (to be called water market rules), 
applying in Basin States that are referring States and in the 
Australian Capital Territory, that: 
 
(a) relate to an act that an irrigation infrastructure operator does, 
or fails to do, in a way that prevents or unreasonably delays 
arrangements being made that would reduce the share 
component of a water access entitlement of the operator to 
allow: 
 
(i) a person’s entitlement to water under an irrigation right 
against the operator; or 
 
(ii) a part of that entitlement; 
 
 to be permanently transformed into a water access 
entitlement that is held by someone other than the operator; 
and 
 
(b) contribute to achieving the Basin water market and trading 
objectives and principles set out in Schedule 3. 
Arrangements of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) are referred 
to in this section as transformation arrangements. 
 
(2) Water market rules are legislative instruments. 
 
(3) Without limiting subsection (1), water market rules may deal with 
the restrictions that an irrigation infrastructure operator may, or 
may not, impose in relation to: 
 
(a) transformation arrangements; or 
 
(b) the trading or transferring, by a person who had an irrigation 
right against the operator, of a water access entitlement, or 
part of such an entitlement, obtained as a result of

charge; or 
 
(b) requiring the approval of a person who holds a legal or 
equitable interest in an irrigation right that a person has

(3) A single infringement notice must relate only to a single 
contravention of a single designated civil penalty provision unless

particular period or before a particular time; and 
 
(b) the person fails or refuses to do that thing within that period 
or before that time; and 
 
(c) the failure or refusal occurs on more than 1 day; and 
 
(d) each contravention is constituted by the failure or refusal on 
one of those days. 
However, the infringement notice must not require the person to 
pay more than one penalty in respect of the same conduct.

Amount of penalty 
 
(2) If the infringement notice relates to only one alleged contravention 
of the provision by the person, the amount to be stated in the notice 
for the purposes of paragraph (1)(f) is the lesser of the following: 
 
(a) one-fifth of the maximum penalty that a court could impose

114. Efficient Regulation of the River Murray 
Any water used by either New South Wales or Victoria or supplied 
to South Australia by either of those States is deemed to be 
provided from water allocated to that State and the Authority may, 
as necessary to ensure the availability of appropriately allocated 
water at the place of such use or supply, reallocate quantities of 
water in the upper River Murray but must not thereby alter the total 
quantities of water allocated to New South Wales or Victoria 
respectively, in the upper River Murray.  
115. Accounting Procedures  
Subject to clauses 112, 113, 114, 116 and 121, the quantity of 
water in any part of the upper River Murray and which is allocated 
to either New South Wales or Victoria is deemed:  
(a) 
to increase in any period by the quantity of water allocated 
to that State flowing into that part in that period; and  
(b) 
to decrease in any period by any quantities of water -  
(i) 
used by that State by way of diversion or loss from 
that part in that period; or  
(ii) 
passed from that part in that period for -  
•   downstream use by that State,  
•   supply by that State to South Australia,  
•   conveyance to another part of the upper River 
Murray as water allocated to that State; or  
(iii) 
released from that part in that period and determined 
under clause 122 to be a release of water allocated to 
that State; or  
(iv) 
spilled from that part in that period and deemed under 
clause 117 to be a spill of water allocated to that State.

quantity of water allocated to either State in the storage exceeding 
half the lesser of:  
(a) 
the target capacity of the storage; or  
(b) 
the quantity of water stored when releases are being made 
for flood mitigation.  
(2) 
In Hume and Lake Victoria, “target capacity” means the capacity 
of the reservoir at the Full Supply Level.  
(3) 
In Dartmouth “target capacity” means the lesser of:  
(a) 
the capacity of the reservoir at the Full Supply Level; or  
(b) 
the quantity of water stored when water is being released 
through the hydro-electric power station and the storage 
level is above the level specified by the Ministerial Council 
for the operation of the power station.  
(4) 
In Menindee Lakes “target capacity” means the greater of the 
capacity:  
(a) 
at the Full Supply Level; or  
(b) 
at such higher level as may be determined from time to time 
by the Ministerial Council.  
(5) 
When water in Dartmouth Reservoir is to be re-allocated under 
sub-clause (1) and there is capacity in Hume Reservoir available to 
the State from which water is to be re-allocated to store some or all 
of the re-allocated water, a compensating adjustment must be made 
in Hume Reservoir so that the accounts of the State from which the 
water is to be re-allocated in Dartmouth Reservoir are not thereby 
reduced. 
117. Accounting for Spill from Storages  
Any quantity of water spilled from any of the upper River Murray 
storages, including water released solely to provide space for the 
retention of floodwaters, is deemed to be water spilled out of the 
waters allocated to New South Wales or Victoria respectively, in 
such proportions as minimizes the re-allocation of water under 
sub-clause 116(1).

(1) 
Whenever the storage level in Dartmouth Reservoir is above the 
level determined for the purposes of this sub-clause by the 
Ministerial Council, releases made from Dartmouth Reservoir 
through the hydro-electric power station will be deemed to be spills 
and will be accounted for as provided in clause 117.  
(2) 
No release from Dartmouth Reservoir will be attributable to the 
allocation of water to New South Wales or Victoria if the quantity 
of water in Dartmouth Reservoir allocated to that State is less than 
or equal to half the minimum operating storage in the reservoir.  
(3) 
Releases from Dartmouth Reservoir other than those covered by 
sub-clauses (1) and (2) will be attributable to the allocation of 
water to New South Wales or Victoria in such proportions as tend 
most to equalize the quantities of water allocated to those States in 
Hume Reservoir.  
119. Accounting for Releases from Hume Reservoir  
(1) 
Any release made from Hume Reservoir for the deliberate purpose 
of transferring water to Lake Victoria for use at a later date will be 
attributable to the allocation of water to New South Wales or 
Victoria in such proportions as tend most to equalize the quantities 
of water allocated to the respective States in Lake Victoria and the 
Menindee Lakes Storage.  
(2) 
Releases from Hume Reservoir other than those covered by 
sub-clause (1) will be attributable to the allocation of water to New 
South Wales or Victoria in such proportions as satisfy the expected 
downstream water requirements of each State.  
120. Accounting for Releases from Menindee Lakes Storage  
(1) 
For the purposes of this clause releases from Menindee Lakes 
Storage consist of:

to the allocation of water to New South Wales;  
(c) 
releases under paragraph (1)(d) and (1)(e) will be attributed 
to the respective allocations of New South Wales and 
Victoria in such proportions as tend most to equalize the 
water in Lake Victoria allocated to each State, provided that 
such proportions do not -  
(i) 
cause the water allocated either to New South Wales 
or to Victoria to fall below 240,000 megalitres;  
(ii) 
cause water to be re-allocated between the States

(1) 
Whenever the Authority directs under clause 98 that the flow of 
water is to exceed the water order at a particular point, unless the 
Ministerial Council determines otherwise, the proportion of the 
water order attributed respectively to New South Wales and 
Victoria must be increased by such amounts as tend most to 
equalise the respective allocations to New South Wales and 
Victoria of the total flow at that point.  
(2) 
For the purpose of this clause the “water order” is the flow of water 
at a particular point which is necessary:  
(a) 
to meet diversions by New South Wales and Victoria, losses 
and dilution flows downstream of that point;  
(b) 
to meet South Australia’s entitlement; and

entitlement of one type into an entitlement of another type, 
in the same valley; and  
(b) 
exchange rates to be applied under this Schedule:  
(i) 
to any transfer of an entitlement by exchange rate 
trade; and  
(ii) 
to any transfer of an entitlement by tagged trade or to 
any transfer of an allocation,  
and must publish any such conversion factors and exchange 
rates in such manner as it thinks fit.  
(2) 
An exchange rate referred to in subparagraph 12(1)(b)(ii) must 
only be made to take into account any changes in distribution 
losses resulting from the transfer.

AGREEMENT 
(see clause 7) 
PART I—RULES WHICH APPLY AT ALL TIMES  
1. 
Interstate transfers of entitlements  
(1) 
Subject to sub-clause 1(2), the Authority must adjust the delivery 
of a State entitlement as a result of each interstate transfer of an 
entitlement, in accordance with Rules 1-4:  
(a) 
in the case of exchange rate trade, by the volume of the 
allocations which would have been made to that entitlement 
in the State of origin in every year, if the entitlement had not 
been transferred; and  
(b) 
in the case of tagged trade, by the volume of water used by 
the transferee in each year.  
(2) 
For the purpose of calculating the volume referred to in 
paragraph 1(1), for exchange rate trade, if the transferor seeks to 
transfer an entitlement with lower reliability, the Authority must 
first apply the relevant conversion factor that would be applied to 
convert that entitlement into a type of entitlement with higher 
reliability, in the valley of origin.  
(3) 
An adjustment made under sub-clause 1(1), must be calculated 
from the effective date of the relevant transfer.  
(4) 
The Authority must alter its procedures for delivering State 
entitlements to reflect any adjustments made under sub-clause 1(1), 
in the manner set out in any protocol made under 
paragraph 6(1)(e).

DIVERSIONS 
(see clause 8) 
1. 
Definitions  
For the purposes of this Appendix:  
 
cap required, with respect to a unit of a type of entitlement, means 
the product of that unit multiplied by the appropriate cap factor 
referred to in paragraph 8(c).  
effective date means the beginning of the year in which this 
Appendix comes into effect.  
PART I—ADJUSTING FOR TRANSFERRED ALLOCATIONS  
2. 
Adjusting cap for transferred allocations  
The annual diversion target for a designated river valley, referred 
to in sub-clause 12(1) of Schedule E, must either be increased or 
reduced, as the case requires, by the volume of any interstate or 
intervalley transfers of allocations into or out of that designated 
river valley in that year, multiplied by the appropriate cap transfer 
rate set out in Table 1 of a protocol made under paragraph 6(1)(a) 
of the Schedule.

4. 
Interim register  
The Authority must establish and maintain an interim register 
which records the volume of any entitlement transferred from a 
designated river valley to another designated river valley during 
each year between 1 July 1994 and the effective date.  
5. 
Adjusting annual diversion targets  
Each year, the Authority must calculate the adjustment to the 
annual diversion target for a designated river valley for transfers 
recorded on the interim register referred to in clause 4, by:  
(a) 
multiplying the cumulative volume of every entitlement of a 
particular type transferred into the designated river valley 
between 1 July 1994 and the earlier of the beginning of that 
year and the effective date, by the appropriate cap transfer 
rate set out in Table 2 of a protocol made under 
paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Schedule; and  
(b) 
multiplying the cumulative volume of every entitlement of a 
particular type transferred out of the designated river valley 
between 1 July 1994 and the earlier of the beginning of that 
year and the effective date, by the appropriate cap transfer 
rate; and  
(c) 
subtracting the product of (b) from the product of (a).

RATES  
6. 
Object of Part  
The object of this Part is, subject to sub-clause 8(1) of the 
Schedule, to minimise the impact of transfers or conversion of 
entitlements on entitlements held by third parties, by endeavouring 
to ensure that:  
(a) 
the proportion of the cap associated with each unit of a 
particular type of entitlement remains the same after an 
entitlement has been transferred or converted as it was 
before that transfer or conversion; and  
(b) 
the annual diversion target for each State and designated 
river valley referred to in sub-clause 12(1) of Schedule E is 
adjusted accordingly.  
7. 
Operation of Part  
This Part applies to entitlements transferred or converted after the 
effective date.  
8. 
Calculating increases in cap required  
Based on information set out in the Transfer Register, the 
Authority must make the following calculations for every year, in 
respect of each designated river valley, as a consequence of 
transfers between that designated river valley and every other 
designated river valley:  
(a) 
The volume of each type of entitlement into which former 
entitlements were transferred or converted, as recorded 
under sub-paragraphs 16(3)(b)(ii) and 16(3)(a)(ii) of this 
Schedule.  
(b) 
The net increase in each type of entitlement, by 
subtracting the volume of that type of entitlement recorded 
under sub-paragraphs 16(3)(a)(iii) and 16(3)(a)(i) of this

Water Act 2007 
 
Compilation No. 29 
Compilation date: 01/09/2021

Stage 1  
Adjust annual diversion targets, as far as possible by 
allocating to the cap required in a designated river valley of 
destination, so much of the volume of cap no longer required 
in the designated river valley of origin as is required in the 
designated river valley of destination. A separate calculation 
must be made for the interaction between each designated 
river valley and every other designated river valley, based on 
information collated from the Transfer Register.  
Stage 2  
Pool any cap surpluses and deficits calculated under Stage 1 
in relation to each designated river valley, in order to reduce 
any shortfalls in each designated river valley.  
Where lower reliability entitlements have been converted to 
higher reliability entitlements within a designated river 
valley, the net effect of that conversion on the cap 
attributable to that valley must be included in the pool. 
However:  
(a) 
a shortfall within a designated river valley caused by such 
conversions cannot be reduced by attributing a surplus 
existing in another designated river valley; and  
(b) 
the volume pooled with respect to a designated river valley 
cannot exceed the sum of the deficits arising in other 
designated river valleys, as a result of transfers between that 
designated river valley and other designated river valleys.  
Stage 3  
(a) 
Calculate any cap surplus resulting from Stage 2 for each 
designated river valley.  
(b) 
Then allocate any of that cap surplus that is attributable to 
interstate transfers into or from that designated river valley 
to the environment, by  
(c) 
reducing the annual diversion target for that designated river 
valley by the portion of the surplus referred to in 
paragraph (b).

The allocation referred to in paragraph (b) must only apply 
in the year in which it is made and will not create an 
entitlement to draw a comparable volume of water from any 
storage in the Basin. Progressively reducing annual 
diversion targets will, however, eventually allow more water 
to flow downstream.  
Stage 4  
Calculate the adjustment to each annual diversion target for 
each designated river valley by determining the sum of the 
total adjustments made under Stages 1, 2 and 3.

“Plan” means a Deferred Water Storage and Delivery Plan 
approved in accordance with clause 7. 
“pre-release” means to release water from a major storage solely 
for the purpose of creating capacity in the major storage to be used 
to mitigate downstream flooding.

major storage in a downstream major storage, when the water was 
released for a purpose other than a planned transfer of water to the 
downstream major storage. 
“substitute” means to alter an account to substitute a volume of 
water to be shown as being stored in an upstream major storage for 
an equivalent volume of water previously shown as being stored in 
a downstream major storage. 
“transfer” means to transfer a volume of water held in an 
upstream major storage to a downstream major storage. 
“unused capacity”, for a major storage at any time, means the 
capacity not then used by an upper State, comprising the difference 
between: 
(a) 
the lesser of: 
(i) 
the target capacity of the major storage as set out in 
clause 116 of the Agreement; and 
(ii) 
if the Authority thinks there is a risk that water may 
have to be released from that major storage for flood 
mitigation—the volume of water that the Authority 
estimates will be held in the major storage when the 
release occurs; and 
(b) 
the volume in storage and attributed to the upper States at 
that time. 
“upper State” means each of New South Wales and Victoria. 
“year” means the 12 months beginning on 1 June.

(3) 
Clause 3 of the Agreement applies to this Schedule as if a reference 
to the Agreement in the clause were a reference to this Schedule. 
(4) 
For clause 91 and paragraph 130 (6) (b) of the Agreement, storing 
water after the time when a part of South Australia’s entitlement 
would otherwise have been delivered: 
(a) 
will have an effect on water availability for an upper State if 
continuing to store the part of South Australia’s entitlement 
in accordance with the Plan, or any approved departure from 
the Plan, either reduces the volume of water available for 
allocation by the upper State or limits its ability to store any 
part of the State water entitlement of the upper State; and 
(b) 
will have an effect on storage access by an upper State if 
delivering part of South Australia’s entitlement that South 
Australia has continued to store in accordance with the Plan, 
or any approved departure from the Plan, limits the 
Authority’s ability to deliver any part of the State water 
entitlement of the upper State because limitations on the 
capacity of either or both: 
(i) 
river channels to carry the necessary flow; or 
(ii) 
a major storage to release sufficient water; 
affect the ability to deliver the State water entitlements of 
both States simultaneously. 
(5) 
The Authority must determine when an effect mentioned in 
paragraph (4) (a) or (4) (b) has occurred, taking into account any 
relevant Plan, other provisions of this Schedule and any other 
relevant circumstances. 
(6) 
Whenever the Authority is required to form an opinion for this 
Schedule, it must do so reasonably in all the circumstances, and 
must take into account any relevant prevailing professional 
standards. 
3. 
Commencement 
Unless the Ministerial Council determines otherwise, this Schedule 
takes effect on the first day of the year after it is approved by the 
Ministerial Council.

downstream of Hume Dam, the deferred water must initially be 
held in Lake Victoria. 
(4) 
Subclauses (2) and (3) apply whether the deferred water is either: 
(a) 
part of South Australia’s entitlement under clause 88 of the 
Agreement, that is stored under clause 91 of the Agreement; 
or 
(b) 
allocations acquired for use in South Australia from within 
an upper State. 
11. 
Transferring deferred water downstream 
(1) 
Subject to subclauses (5) and (6), the Authority must transfer 
deferred water from an upstream major storage to a downstream 
major storage in accordance with those provisions of a Plan, or 
approved departure from a Plan, that apply during minimum inflow 
conditions, or other inflow conditions specified in the Plan. 
(2) 
Despite subclause (1) but subject to subclauses (5) and (6), the 
Authority may transfer deferred water from an upstream major 
storage to a downstream major storage at any time, at the request 
of the Committee member for South Australia. 
(3) 
Despite subclause (1) but subject to subclauses (5) and (6), the 
Authority must, with the prior written consent of the Committee 
member for South Australia, transfer deferred water from an

carry-over in South Australia—storage access by an upper 
State. 
(6) 
The Authority may decide not to transfer deferred water in 
accordance with subclause (1), (2) or (3) if, in the opinion of the 
Authority, prevailing circumstances for river operations make it 
impractical to do so. 
(7) 
The Authority must give  written reasons to the Committee

storage with any deferred water transferred to the major storage 
under this clause when, in the Authority’s opinion, the deferred 
water has reached the downstream major storage. 
12. 
Substituting deferred water upstream 
(1) 
Unless the Plan, or an approved departure from the Plan, provides 
otherwise, whenever: 
(a) 
the volume of deferred water held in a downstream storage 
exceeds the volume of deferred water to be delivered under 
the Plan, or an approved departure from the Plan, during the 
remainder of the year; and 
(b) 
the Authority, for the purpose of normal river operations, is 
required to transfer a volume of water from an upstream 
storage to a downstream storage; and 
(c) 
in the Authority’s view, it would be practicable to use a 
volume of water held in the downstream storage for the 
purpose mentioned in paragraph (b);

deferred water held in the Menindee Lakes Storage for water held 
in the Hume Reservoir. 
(3) 
The Authority must progressively adjust the relevant accounts of 
the upper States and South Australia maintained under 
Subdivisions D and E of Division 1 of Part XII of the Agreement 
as deferred water is substituted from a major storage to another in 
accordance with subclause (1) to reflect the effect of each 
substitution of deferred water. 
PART 3 – DELIVERING DEFERRED WATER 
13. 
Deferred water delivered at South Australia’s request 
(1) 
Subject to subclause (2), except for deferred water that spills from 
a major storage, the Authority must only deliver deferred water 
from a major storage to South Australia in accordance with a Plan 
or departure from a Plan approved under clause 7. 
(2) 
Despite subclause (1), the Authority may deliver deferred water to 
South Australia at any time, at the request of the Committee 
member for South Australia. 
(3)

(2) 
If the Authority receives a cancellation under subclause (1) after 
giving directions to release deferred water, the Authority must 
either: 
(a) 
store in a downstream major storage any deferred water 
released for delivery to South Australia before the Authority 
directs that the delivery of deferred water should cease; or 
(b) 
if, in the Authority’s opinion it is not possible to comply 
with paragraph (a), debit that deferred water to the relevant 
account. 
15. 
Deferred water not part of South Australia’s entitlement 
Any deferred water delivered for use in South Australia during any 
period under this Schedule is in addition to, and is not part of, other 
water delivered to South Australia under the Agreement in the 
same period. 
16. 
South Australia’s exclusive right to use deferred water 
Unless the Committee member for South Australia and the 
Committee member for an upper State agree otherwise, and subject 
to subclause 17 (4), the upper State must not divert any water that 
is taken to be deferred water by the Authority. 
17. 
Spills and pre-releases 
(1) 
If: 
(a) 
water spills from a major storage in which deferred water is 
stored; or 
(b) 
water is pre-released from a major storage, in which deferred 
water is stored, for flood mitigation purposes; 
the water must be taken to be deferred water, until a volume 
equivalent to the volume of deferred water stored in the major 
storage immediately before the relevant event has either spilled or 
been pre-released.

private carry-over must be taken to have spilled or been 
pre-released before any deferred water stored for the purpose of 
meeting critical human water needs. 
(3) 
The Authority must, whenever possible, re-regulate any water 
taken to be deferred water under subclause (1) in a downstream 
major storage, for use by South Australia. 
(4) 
If the Authority is unable to re-regulate spilled or pre-released 
deferred water in accordance with subclause (3), the water must be 
accounted for as environmental flows. 
(5) 
If there is deferred water in Dartmouth Reservoir and water is 
transferred from Dartmouth Reservoir to Hume Reservoir, with the 
effect of increasing the likelihood that each of these major storages 
will spill simultaneously: 
(a) 
the deferred water is taken to be transferred first and 
becomes deferred water in Hume Reservoir; and 
(b) 
deferred water for the purpose of meeting private carry-over 
is taken to be transferred before any deferred water stored 
for the purposes of meeting critical human water needs. 
18. 
Limitations on channels and storages  
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, either generally or in 
a particular case, whenever the delivery of water is restricted due to 
either or both of limitations on the capacity: 
(a) 
of river channels to carry that flow; or 
(b) 
a major storage to release sufficient water to meet the 
commitments of any State to supply allocations at any time;  
then delivery of deferred water for the purpose of meeting private 
carry-over must be given the lowest priority. 
19. 
Reallocation of deferred water 
(1) 
Despite Part 2 and this Part, but subject to subclause (2), the 
Authority may reallocate volumes of deferred water between major 
storages and adjust the accounts accordingly if, after considering

(2) 
In reallocating deferred water under subclause (1), the Authority 
must not: 
(a) 
reduce the total volume of deferred water then held in all 
major storages and entered in the accounts; or 
(b) 
affect either or both of: 
(i) 
water availability for an upper State; or

Establishing and maintaining accounts 
(1) 
The Authority must, in accordance with the requirements of this 
Part, establish and maintain: 
(a) 
a separate account for deferred water held in each major 
storage showing the respective volumes stored at any time 
for the purpose of meeting:

3  Water storage and delivery 
 
(1) Pricing policies for water storage and delivery in rural systems are 
to be developed to facilitate efficient water use and trade in water 
entitlements. 
 
(2) Water charges are to include a consumption-based component. 
 
(3) Water charges are to be based on full cost recovery for water 
services to ensure business viability and avoid monopoly rents, 
including recovery of environmental externalities where feasible 
and practical. 
 
(4) Water charges in the rural water sector are to continue to move 
towards upper bound pricing where practicable. 
 
(5) In subclause (4): 
upper bound pricing means the level at which, to avoid monopoly 
rents, a water business should not recover more than: 
 
(a) the operational, maintenance and administrative costs, 
externalities, taxes or tax equivalent regimes; and 
 
(b) provision for the cost of asset consumption; and 
 
(c) provision for the cost of capital (calculated using a weighted 
average cost of capital). 
 
(6) If full cost recovery is unlikely to be achieved and a Community 
Service Obligation is deemed necessary: 
 
(a) the size of the subsidy is to be reported publicly; and 
 
(b) where practicable, subsidies or Community Service 
Obligations are to be reduced or eliminated. 
 
(7) Pricing policies should ensure consistency across sectors and 
jurisdictions where entitlements are able to be traded.

Schedule 3—Basin water market and trading 
objectives and principles 
Note: 
See section 4. 
   
   
1  Definitions 
 
 In this Schedule: 
exchange rate means the rate of conversion to be applied to water 
to be traded from one trading zone and/or jurisdiction to another. 
trading zones means zones established to simplify administration 
of a trade by setting out the known supply source or management 
arrangements and the physical realities of relevant supply systems 
within the zone so that trade can occur within and between zones 
without first having to investigate and establish the details and 
rules of the system in each zone. 
water access entitlement tagging means an accounting approach 
that allows a water access entitlement that is traded from one 
jurisdiction or trading zone to another jurisdiction or trading zone 
to retain its original characteristics when traded to the new 
jurisdiction or trading zone (rather than being converted into a 
form issued in the new jurisdiction or trading zone). 
2  Objectives and principles 
 
 This Schedule sets out: 
 
(a) the Basin water market and trading objectives; and 
 
(b) the Basin water market and trading principles. 
Note 1: 
These objectives and principles are relevant to the formulation of: 
(a) the provisions of the Basin Plan (see item 12 of the table in 
subsection 22(1)); and 
(b) the provisions of water management plans for particular water 
resource plan areas (see subsection 22(3)); and 
(c) the provisions of the water market rules (see paragraph 97(1)(b)).

These objectives and principles are based on those set out in 
clauses 58 to 63 and Schedule G of the National Water Initiative when 
Part 2 of this Act commences. 
3  Basin water market and trading objectives 
 
 The objectives of the water market and trading arrangements for 
the Murray-Darling Basin are: 
 
(a) to facilitate the operation of efficient water markets and the 
opportunities for trading, within and between Basin States, 
where water resources are physically shared or hydrologic 
connections and water supply considerations will permit 
water trading; and 
 
(b) to minimise transaction cost on water trades, including 
through good information flows in the market and compatible 
entitlement, registry, regulatory and other arrangements 
across jurisdictions; and 
 
(c) to enable the appropriate mix of water products to develop 
based on water access entitlements which can be traded either 
in whole or in part, and either temporarily or permanently, or 
through lease arrangements or other trading options that may 
evolve over time; and 
 
(d) to recognise and protect the needs of the environment; and 
 
(e) to provide appropriate protection of third-party interests. 
4  Basin water market and trading principles 
 
(1) This clause sets out the Basin water market and trading principles. 
 
(2) Water access entitlements may be traded either permanently, 
through lease arrangements, or through other trading options that 
may evolve over time, if water resources are physically shared or 
hydrologic connections and water supply considerations would 
permit water trading. 
 
(3) All trades should be recorded on a water register. Registers will be 
compatible, publicly accessible and reliable, recording information 
on a whole of catchment basis, consistent with the National Water 
Initiative.

(4) Restrictions on extraction, diversion or use of water resulting from 
trade can only be used to manage: 
 
(a) environmental impacts, including impacts on ecosystems that 
depend on underground water; or 
 
(b) hydrological, water quality and hydro-geological impacts; or 
 
(c) delivery constraints; or 
 
(d) impacts on geographical features (such as river and aquifer 
integrity); or 
 
(e) features of major indigenous, cultural heritage or spiritual 
significance. 
 
(5) A trade may be refused on the basis that it is inconsistent with the 
relevant water resource plan. 
 
(6) Trades must not result in the long-term annual diversion limit 
being exceeded. That is, trades must not: 
 
(a) cause an increase in commitments to take water from water 
resources or parts of water resources; or 
 
(b) increase seasonal reversals in flow regimes; 
above sustainable levels identified in relevant water resource plans 
such that environmental water or water dependent ecosystems are 
adversely affected. 
 
(7) Trades within overallocated water resources (including ground 
water resources) may be permitted in some cases subject to 
conditions to manage long-term impacts on the environment and 
other users. 
 
(8) Where necessary, water authorities will facilitate trade by 
specifying trading zones and providing related information such as 
the exchange rates to be applied to trades in water allocations to: 
 
(a) adjust for the effects of the transfer on hydrology or supply 
security (transmission losses) or reliability; and 
 
(b) reflect transfers between different classes of water resources, 
unregulated streams, regulated streams, supplemented 
streams, ground water systems and licensed runoff harvesting 
dams.

(9) Water trading zones, including ground water trading zones, should 
be defined in terms of: 
 
(a) the ability to change the point of extraction of the water from 
one place to another; and 
 
(b) the protection of the environment. 
The volume of delivery losses in supplemented systems that 
provide opportunistic environmental flows will be estimated and 
taken into account when determining the maximum volume of 
water that may be traded out of a trading zone. 
 
(10) Exchange rates must not be used to achieve other outcomes such as 
to alter the balance between economic use and environmental 
protection or to reduce overall water use. 
 
(11) Trade in water allocations may occur within common aquifers or 
surface water flow systems consistent with water resource plans. 
 
(12) Trade from a licensed runoff harvesting dam (that is, not a small 
farm dam) to a river may occur subject to: 
 
(a) a reduction in dam capacity consistent with the transferred 
water access entitlement; or 
 
(b) retention of sufficient capacity to accommodate evaporative 
and infiltration losses; or 
 
(c) conditions specified in water resource plans to protect the 
environment. 
 
(13) Compatible institutional and regulatory arrangements will be 
pursued to improve intrastate and interstate trade, and to manage 
differences in entitlement reliability, supply losses, supply source 
constraints, trading between systems and cap requirements. 
 
(14) The transfer of water allocations and entitlements will be 
facilitated (where appropriate) by water access entitlement tagging, 
water access entitlement exchange rates or other trading 
mechanisms that may evolve over time. 
 
(15) Institutional, legislative and administrative arrangements will be 
introduced to improve the efficiency and scope of water trade and 
to remove barriers that may affect potential trade.

Part 1—Clauses 48 to 50 of the National Water 
Initiative 
   
48.      Water access entitlement holders are to bear the risks of any reduction 
or less reliable water allocation, under their water access entitlements, 
arising from reductions to the consumptive pool as a result of: 
 
(i) seasonal or long-term changes in climate; and 
 
(ii) periodic natural events such as bushfires and drought. 
49.      The risks of any reduction or less reliable water allocation under a water 
access entitlement, arising as a result of bona fide improvements in the 
knowledge of water systems’ capacity to sustain particular extraction 
levels are to be borne by users up to 2014. Risks arising under 
comprehensive water plans commencing or renewed after 2014 are to 
be shared over each ten year period in the following way: 
 
i) water access entitlement holders to bear the first 3% 
reduction in water allocation under a water access 
entitlement; 
 
ii) State/Territory governments and the Commonwealth 
Government to share one-third and two-thirds 
respectively reductions in water allocation under water 
access entitlements of between 3% and 6%; and 
 
iii) State/Territory and Commonwealth governments to 
equally share reductions in water allocation under water 
access entitlements greater than 6%. 
50.      Governments are to bear the risks of any reduction or less reliable water 
allocation that is not previously provided for, arising from changes in 
government policy (for example, new environmental objectives). In 
such cases, governments may recover this water in accordance with the 
principles for assessing the most efficient and cost effective measures 
for water recovery.
