**Article 5** - Within a maximum period of five years from the date of publication of this law, the municipalities of localities with a municipal organization shall draw up a project for the improvement, modification, or reconstruction of the currently existing water installations in a manner compliant with the rules of hygiene—taking into account their quantity, qualities, and other characteristics relative to the population and particular conditions of that locality—and shall submit it to the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance for examination and approval. The approval of these projects by the ministry within two months at the latest is required. It is mandatory to commence construction and installation within two years following the approval of the projects. It is also necessary that the waters supplied or to be supplied to villages, or procured or to be procured locally, and their installations possess the requisite sanitary and technical conditions, and in this regard, action shall be taken in accordance with the opinion and views of the local health officials.

**Article 7** - The beneficiaries of waters belonging to pious foundations or individuals that have been transferred to municipal administration shall continue to benefit from them as before, without being obliged to pay a participation share for these waters.

**Article 8** - This law shall enter into force on the date of its publication.

**Article 9** - The Prime Minister and the Ministers of the Interior and of Health and Social Assistance are charged with the execution of the provisions of this law.

**Additional Article 1** - Even if the sources of waters designated for the common needs of a municipality or its people are located outside the municipal boundaries, the maintenance, repair, and cleaning of the watercourses and sources, and ensuring the water is kept in a condition compliant with health standards, shall be the responsibility of the municipalities.

**Additional Article 2** - If the sources of waters designated for the common needs of a village or its people are located outside its own boundaries, the village council of elders shall perform the duties specified in the preceding article.

**Additional Article 3** - Usufructuary shares in the common waters of cities, towns, and villages shall be determined according to existing documents and customs. If the shares can be utilized independently, they shall be separated. If they cannot, the waters shall be managed jointly in accordance with customs that have been determined and finalized.

**Additional Article 4** - The concerned cities, towns, and villages may also manage waters that are to be jointly administered through a union they shall establish in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Law. Common waters that, due to disagreement, are not managed according to custom or by forming a union shall be managed by a union to be established by the decision of the highest local administrative official and with the vote of the majority. Compliance with decisions made by a majority of the union is mandatory for all concerned parties.

**Additional Article 5** - The determination and separation procedures specified in this law shall be carried out by a commission convened under the chairmanship of the mayor, composed of one member elected by each of the municipal councils, councils of elders, and the real and legal persons holding specific shares. On behalf of those who refrain from electing a member to the commission, a person shall be appointed by the highest local administrative official. The decision rendered by a majority of the commission shall be valid and shall be announced by being posted at the municipality and in the village chambers and notified to the concerned parties. Within fifteen days of notification, concerned parties may file a written objection to these decisions with the administrative board. Administrative Boards shall examine and resolve these objections with priority over all other business. These decisions, as well as decisions that are not objected to in due time and are approved by the administrative official, are final. Those who do not consent to the usufructuary share determined in this manner may apply to the court. However, until a final contrary decision is obtained from the court, the commission's decisions shall be enforced.

**Additional Article 6** - After the custom has been determined and finalized, the costs necessary for the maintenance, repair, and cleaning of the common watercourses from the water source to the municipal boundary and for keeping the water in a condition compliant with health standards shall be distributed to and collected from the municipality and the shareholders in proportion to their shares, and then expended. In extraordinary circumstances, the municipality shall first take the necessary measures and incur the costs, and then demand their respective shares from the concerned parties. The labor of concerned parties who wish to contribute by working in person shall be credited towards their participation shares. Concerned parties may file a written objection with the local administrative board within seven days of being notified of the amount of costs determined by the municipality or, if one exists, by the union. The decisions of the administrative board shall be final.

**Additional Article 7** - Municipalities or councils of elders may prohibit the opening of fields, or the grazing or watering of animals, at drinking water sources in any manner that would cause harm or impair health standards.

**Additional Article 8** - For waters whose sources are located outside municipal boundaries, the municipality's authority to impose penalties on those who act contrary to the measures and decisions taken for the maintenance, protection, and management of the sources and watercourses and for keeping them in a condition compliant with health standards, or contrary to the prohibitions under the provisions of the seventh article, shall extend all the way to the source, irrespective of municipal boundaries. If a union has been established, this authority shall be exercised by the union.

**Additional Article 9** - The provisions of the Law on the Collection of Public Receivables shall be applied to those who fail to pay their cost participation shares.
