SUMMARY
Assembly of the Republic:
Law No. 16/91: Approves the Water Law.
Law No. 17/91: Approves the Law on Public Enterprises.

ASSEMBLY OF THE REPUBLIC
Law No. 16/91
of 3 August

The importance of water resources in all sectors of life has led to an ever-increasing need for their use.
Water is used for various purposes according to the needs and quantities that each user deems necessary. In order that the use of water by multiple interested parties does not prejudice the needs of some, it is essential to create mechanisms conducive to its distribution or supply in accordance with the needs of each one.
This Water Law establishes the water resources that belong to the public domain, the principles of water management, the need for an inventory of all existing water resources in the country, the general regime for their use, the priorities to be taken into account, the general rights of users and their corresponding obligations, among others.
The right to use waters of the public domain will be recognized under a free use regime, in certain cases, and by means of use authorizations or development concessions, in specially regulated cases.
The Water Law emerges as a fundamental instrument for the realization and satisfaction of the interests of the Mozambican people.
In these terms, under the provisions of Article 135(1) of the Constitution of the Republic, the Assembly of the Republic determines:

Law No. 17/91
of 3 August

Law No. 2/81 of 30 September established the rules for the organization and functioning of state enterprises.
The philosophy underlying the principles enshrined in the said law, due to recent economic-financial circumstances, namely the Economic Rehabilitation Program, shows that the legal regime applicable to state enterprises is considerably outdated.
Thus, it is necessary to introduce new legal mechanisms in order to ensure ever-increasing efficiency and profitability of the public enterprise sector.
Simultaneously, the opportunity should be taken to change the designation from "state enterprise" to a new denomination that, beyond the purely formal aspect, entails a profound change in the management of enterprises endowed with State capital.
In these terms, under the provisions of Article 135(1) of the Constitution of the Republic, the Assembly of the Republic determines:
