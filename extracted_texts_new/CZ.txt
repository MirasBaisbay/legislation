(2) Groundwaters are waters naturally occurring below the earth's surface in the saturated zone in direct contact with rocks; waters flowing through underground drainage systems and waters in wells are also considered groundwaters.

(3) A water body is a defined, significant concentration of surface or groundwater in a specific environment, characterized by a common form of occurrence or common properties of the water and features of the hydrological regime. Water bodies are divided into surface water bodies and groundwater bodies.

(4) A surface water body is a defined concentration of surface water in a specific environment, for example in a lake, in a reservoir, or in the bed of a watercourse.

(5) A heavily modified water body is a surface water body that has been substantially altered in character as a result of human activity.

(6) An artificial water body is a surface water body created by human activity.

(7) A groundwater body is a defined concentration of groundwater in the relevant aquifer or aquifers; an aquifer is understood as a rock layer or formation of rock layers with sufficient permeability to allow for significant continuous accumulation of groundwater or its flow or abstraction.

(8) A water resource is surface or groundwater that is used or can be used to meet human needs, particularly for drinking purposes.

(9) Management of surface or groundwaters is their impoundment by means of waterworks, the use of their energy potential, their use for navigation or timber rafting, for fish or waterfowl farming, their abstraction, the discharge of wastewater into them, and other ways in which their properties can be utilized or their quantity, flow, occurrence, or quality can be influenced.

(10) A river basin is an area of land from which all surface runoff flows through a network of watercourses and, where applicable, lakes to the sea at a single river mouth, estuary, or delta.

(11) A sub-basin is an area of land from which all surface runoff flows through a network of watercourses and, where applicable, lakes to a certain point of a watercourse (usually a lake or a confluence of rivers).

(12) A hydrogeological district is an area with similar hydrogeological conditions, type of aquifer, and groundwater circulation.

(13) A water line is a continuously connected network of watercourses and other water lines, including parts impounded by a waterwork and temporarily covered sections, interrupted only at places where natural infiltration occurs.

(14) Other water line is a flowing surface or groundwater that does not correspond to the definition of a watercourse under § 43.

(15) An authorized person is a professionally competent legal person authorized by a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture to carry out technical safety supervision over waterworks, including the preparation of a technical safety supervision program and the preparation of the scope of technical safety supervision measurements, within the scope of its authorization, and to prepare expert opinions for the classification of waterworks into categories from the perspective of technical safety supervision.

(16) An authorization is a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture granting authorization to carry out technical safety supervision over waterworks, including the preparation of a technical safety supervision program and the preparation of the scope of technical safety supervision measurements, and to prepare expert opinions for the classification of waterworks into categories from the perspective of technical safety supervision.

(4) Good status of surface waters means such a status of a surface water body where both its ecological and chemical status are at least good.

(5) Good status of groundwaters means such a status of a groundwater body where both its quantitative and chemical status are at least good.

(6) Good chemical status of surface waters means the chemical status necessary to achieve the objectives of water protection as a component of the environment (§ 23a), where the concentrations of pollutants do not exceed environmental quality standards.

(7) Good chemical status of groundwaters means the chemical status necessary to achieve the objectives of water protection as a component of the environment (§ 23a), where the concentrations of pollutants do not exceed environmental quality standards.

(8) An environmental quality standard means the concentration of a pollutant or group of pollutants in water, sediment, or living organisms which must not be exceeded for reasons of protecting human health and the environment.

(9) The quantitative status of groundwaters is an expression of the degree to which a groundwater body is affected by direct and indirect abstractions.

§ 3
Rights to Waters and the Legal Nature of Water

(1) Surface and groundwaters are not subject to ownership and are not part of or appurtenant to the land on which or under which they occur; rights to these waters are regulated by this Act.

TITLE V
PROTECTION OF WATER CONDITIONS AND WATER RESOURCES

Division 1
Protection of Water Conditions

§ 27

Owners of land are obliged, unless a special legal regulation provides otherwise,¹⁸) to ensure the care of their land in such a way that there is no deterioration of water conditions. In particular, they are obliged under these conditions to ensure that there is no deterioration of runoff conditions, soil loss due to water erosion, and to strive to improve the retention capacity of the landscape.

§ 28
Protected Areas of Natural Water Accumulation

(1) Areas that, due to their natural conditions, form a significant natural accumulation of water are declared by the government by a regulation as protected areas of natural water accumulation.

(2) In protected areas of natural water accumulation, to the extent determined by the government regulation, it is prohibited to
a) reduce the extent of forest lands,
b) drain forest lands,
c) drain agricultural lands,
d) extract peat,
e) extract minerals by surface mining or carry out other earthworks that would lead to the uncovering of a continuous groundwater level,
f) extract and process radioactive raw materials,
g) dispose of radioactive waste,
h) store carbon dioxide⁴⁹) in hydrogeological structures with usable or utilized groundwater reserves.

(3) The Ministry of the Environment may, with the prior consent of the government, permit an exemption from the prohibitions listed in paragraph 2.

(4) If damage is caused to the owner of the land by the prohibition under paragraph 2 let. a) to c), they are entitled to its compensation.

§ 28a
Areas Designated for Surface Water Accumulation

(1) Areas that are morphologically, geologically, and hydrologically suitable for the accumulation of surface waters for reducing the adverse effects of floods and droughts may be defined in the Spatial Development Policy and in land-use planning documentation as areas designated for surface water accumulation to protect them from other activities. In these areas, existing land use may be changed, structures may be located, and other activities may be carried out only if they do not prevent or substantially hinder their future use for surface water accumulation.

(2) The General Plan of Areas Designated for Surface Water Accumulation and the basic principles for the use of these areas shall be prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture in agreement with the Ministry of the Environment. The General Plan is the basis for the draft Spatial Development Policy¹⁸a) and land-use planning documentation.

Division 2
Groundwaters

§ 29

(1) Groundwater resources are preferentially reserved for the supply of drinking water to the population and for purposes for which the use of drinking water is stipulated by a special legal regulation.⁵) The water authority may permit the use of groundwater for other purposes only if it is not to the detriment of satisfying the stated needs. The storage of carbon dioxide⁴⁹) in hydrogeological structures with significant reserves of quality groundwater intended primarily for the supply of drinking water to the population is prohibited.

(2) A person who, during their operational activity,¹⁹) causes the loss of groundwater or a substantial reduction in the possibility of its abstraction from a groundwater source, or a deterioration of its quality, is obliged to compensate for the damage caused thereby to the person who is permitted to abstract groundwater from this water source, and further to take the necessary measures according to local conditions to restore the original state. The compensation consists of providing a substitute water source. If this is not possible or expedient, they are obliged to provide a one-time compensation corresponding to the decrease in the value of this immovable property, with the use of which the permit is associated. Disputes over compensation for damages or its amount are decided by a court. General regulations on compensation for damages are not affected by this.

(3) The owner of a land who, during an activity other than geological works²⁰) on it, discovers the occurrence of groundwater in an unusual quantity (e.g., in such a quantity that requires a change in the technology of foundation engineering or necessitates the abandonment of the construction at this site, etc.) or discovers the occurrence of groundwater with an artesian head (artesian water), is obliged to report this fact to the relevant water authority to determine the yield of the groundwater source.

Division 3
Protection of Water Resources

§ 30
Protection Zones of Water Resources

(1) To protect the yield, quality, and health safety of groundwater or surface water sources used or usable for the supply of drinking water with an average abstraction of more than 10,000 m³ per year and groundwater sources for the production of bottled infant or spring water, the water authority shall establish protection zones by a measure of a general nature. If serious circumstances so require, the water authority may establish protection zones for water sources with a lower capacity than that stated in the first sentence. The water authority may, for serious reasons, change, or possibly abolish, a protection zone. The establishment of protection zones is always in the public interest.

(2) Protection zones are divided into protection zones of the I. degree, which serve to protect the water source in the immediate vicinity of the intake or abstraction facility, and protection zones of the II. degree, which serve to protect the water source in areas determined by the water authority, so that its yield, quality, or health safety is not endangered.

(3) The protection zone of the I. degree shall be established by the water authority as a continuous area
a) for water supply reservoirs and for other reservoirs intended exclusively for the supply of drinking water, at least for the entire area of the reservoir's water level at maximum impoundment,
b) for other reservoirs with water supply use other than those mentioned under letter a), with a minimum distance of the boundary of its definition on the reservoir's water level of 100 m from the abstraction facility,
c) for watercourses

with a weir impoundment on the bank of the abstraction, at least for a length of 200 m upstream from the abstraction point, downstream to a distance of 100 m or to the edge of the impounding structure, and a width of the protection zone of 15 m; in the watercourse, it includes at least one half of its width at the abstraction point,

without a weir impoundment on the bank of the abstraction, at least for a length of 200 m upstream from the abstraction point, downstream to a distance of 50 m from the abstraction point, and a width of the protection zone of 15 m; in the watercourse, it includes at least one-third of its width at the abstraction point,
d) for groundwater sources with a minimum distance of its defined boundary of 10 m from the abstraction facility,
e) in other cases individually.

(4) The water authority may, in justified cases, establish a protection zone of the I. degree in a smaller scope than that specified in paragraph 3 let. a) to d).

(5) The protection zone of the II. degree is established outside the protection zone of the I. degree; it may consist of one continuous area or several separate areas within a hydrological basin or hydrogeological district. The water authority may establish the protection zone of the II. degree, if it is expedient, gradually for individual areas.

(6) The water authority establishes protection zones at the proposal or on its own initiative. If those who have the right to abstract water from the water source, or who apply for a permit for such an abstraction, do not submit a proposal for their establishment, and for water supply reservoirs, those who own the waterworks serving for the impoundment of water in such reservoirs or are their builders, the water authority may impose on them the obligation to submit this proposal with the necessary documents. Reservoirs listed in the list under paragraph 13 are considered water supply reservoirs according to the preceding sentence.

(7) Entry and passage into the protection zone of the I. degree are prohibited; this does not apply to persons who have the right to abstract water from the water source, and for water supply reservoirs, to persons who own these waterworks. The water authority may, by a decision or a measure of a general nature, also grant other exemptions from the prohibition of entry and passage.

(8) In the protection zones of the I. and II. degree, it is prohibited to carry out activities that damage or endanger the yield, quality, or health safety of the water source, the scope of which is defined in the measure of a general nature on the establishment or change of the protection zone.

(9) If the reason for protection ceases to exist, the water authority shall abolish the protection zone by a measure of a general nature.

(10) In the measure of a general nature on the establishment or change of the protection zone of a water source, the water authority shall determine which activities that damage or endanger the yield, quality, or health safety of the water source cannot be carried out in this zone, what technical measures persons under paragraph 12 are obliged to take in the protection zone, and, where applicable, the manner and duration of the restriction on the use of lands and structures located in this zone.

(11) For the proven restriction on the use of lands and structures in the protection zones of water resources, the owners or tenants or lessees of these lands and structures are entitled to compensation, which, at their request, must be provided by the owners of the waterworks enabling the impoundment of water in them in the case of water supply reservoirs, and in other cases by those entitled (§ 8) to abstract water from the water source; if there are more of them, in proportion to the permitted quantity of abstracted water. If no agreement is reached on the provision of compensation, a court shall decide on a one-time compensation.

(12) The costs associated with technical modifications in the protection zones of water resources imposed by the water authority to protect the yield, quality, and health safety are borne by those who are entitled to abstract water from these water sources, or who apply for a permit for its abstraction, and for water supply reservoirs, by the owners or builders of the waterworks serving for the impoundment of water.

(13) The Ministry of the Environment shall, by decree, determine a list of water supply reservoirs and principles for the establishment and change of protection zones of water resources.

Division 5
Water Quality Protection

§ 38
Wastewater

(1) Wastewater is water used in residential, industrial, agricultural, medical, and other buildings, facilities, or means of transport, which has altered quality (composition or temperature) after use, and its mixtures with stormwater, as well as other waters flowing from these buildings, facilities, or means of transport, if they can endanger the quality of surface or groundwaters. Wastewater also includes leachate originating from the operation of landfills and tailings ponds or during subsequent care for them, with the exception of waters that are reused for the organization's own needs, and waters that flow into mine waters.

(2) Wastewater treated at a municipal wastewater treatment plant, which is understood as a facility for treating urban wastewater equipped with technology for the disposal of sewage, must comply in its composition with the applicable sewer regulations.

(3) If wastewater and stormwater are drained together by a unified sewer system¹⁰a), the stormwater becomes wastewater upon inflow into this sewer system.

(4) Waters from drainage systems of drained agricultural lands, cooling waters used on vessels and for water turbines, where only the temperature has increased, and unused mineral waters from a natural medicinal source or a source of natural mineral water are not considered wastewater under this Act. Stormwater from road communications is also not wastewater, provided that the contamination of these waters with harmful substances is addressed by technical measures according to the decree implementing the Act on Road Communications²¹a).

(5) For the purposes of this Act, the treatment of wastewater means its discharge into surface or groundwaters or accumulation with its subsequent removal to a wastewater treatment plant under paragraph 8. Whoever discharges wastewater into surface or groundwaters is obliged to ensure its treatment in accordance with the conditions set in the permit for its discharge. When setting these conditions, the water authority is obliged to take into account the best available technologies in the field of wastewater treatment, which are understood as the most effective and advanced stage of development of the used technology for treatment or purification of wastewater, developed on a scale that allows for its implementation under economically and technically acceptable conditions and is at the same time the most effective for water protection. Whoever discharges mine water into surface or groundwaters under the Act on the Protection and Utilization of Mineral Wealth¹a) may do so only in the manner and under the conditions determined by the water authority.

(6) Whoever discharges wastewater into surface or groundwaters is obliged, in accordance with the decision of the water authority, to measure the volume of discharged water and the degree of its pollution and to submit the results of these measurements to the water authority that issued the decision, the relevant river basin administrator, and the authorized expert body. The water authority shall, by this decision, determine the place and method of measuring the volume and pollution of discharged wastewater and the frequency of submitting the results of these measurements. Sampling and analyses to determine the degree of pollution of discharged wastewater may only be carried out by professionally competent persons authorized to conduct business (hereinafter "accredited laboratory"). Professional competence for the analysis of wastewater and the performance of sampling is demonstrated by an accreditation certificate issued under the Act on Technical Requirements for Products⁵⁷), a certificate of correct laboratory practice, or an authorization to perform official measurements under the Metrology Act⁵⁸), relating to the analytical determination of relevant indicators and the collection of the required type of wastewater samples.

(7) The obligation under paragraph 6 does not apply to a person who treats wastewater through a waterwork intended for the treatment of wastewater up to a capacity of 50 population equivalents notified under § 15a, the essential component of which is a CE-marked product. The list and classification of CE-marked products, including the minimum treatment efficiency for categories of CE-marked products in percentages, shall be determined by the government by a regulation.

(8) Whoever accumulates wastewater in a sealed tank is obliged to ensure its treatment by removal to a wastewater treatment plant and, at the request of the water authority or the Czech Environmental Inspectorate, to present documents on the removal of wastewater for the period of the last two calendar years. The removal may only be carried out by the operator of a wastewater treatment plant or a person authorized under the Trade Licensing Act²³). The person who carries out the removal is obliged to issue a document to the person who accumulates wastewater in a sealed tank, from which the name of the person who accumulates wastewater in the sealed tank, the location of the tank, the quantity of removed wastewater, the date of removal, the name of the person who removed the wastewater, and the name of the wastewater treatment plant to which the wastewater will be treated, will be apparent.

(9) The direct discharge of wastewater into groundwaters is prohibited. The discharge of wastewater not containing hazardous harmful substances or particularly hazardous harmful substances (§ 39 para. 3) from one or several geographically related residential buildings⁵⁰), buildings for family recreation⁵¹), or from individual buildings providing accommodation services⁵²), originating mainly as a product of human metabolism and activities in households, through soil layers into groundwaters may be permitted if, in the given case, the discharge of wastewater into surface waters is not technically possible or desirable with regard to the interests protected by this Act or other legal regulations. A permit for the discharge of wastewater into groundwaters under the second sentence cannot be issued without the consent of a person with professional competence⁸), who assesses the impact of the wastewater discharge on the quality of groundwaters. The maximum permitted quantity of wastewater discharged from one or several geographically related residential buildings must not exceed a total of 15 m³/day.

(10) When permitting the discharge of wastewater into surface or groundwaters, the water authority shall set the maximum permissible values for the quantity and concentration of discharged pollution (emission limits) and the volume of discharged water. When permitting the discharge of wastewater into surface waters, it is bound by the indicators expressing the status of the water in the watercourse, environmental quality standards, indicators and values of permissible pollution of surface waters, indicators and maximum permissible values of wastewater pollution indicators (emission standards) established by a government regulation, and the particulars and conditions of the permit for the discharge of wastewater, including specifications of the best available technologies in the field of wastewater treatment and the conditions of their use, which are determined by a government regulation, and the best available techniques⁵⁹) in the field of wastewater treatment. When permitting the discharge of wastewater into groundwaters, it is bound by the indicators expressing the status of groundwater in the relevant groundwater body, indicators and values of permissible pollution of groundwaters, indicators and permissible values of wastewater pollution, and the particulars and conditions of the permit for the discharge of wastewater into groundwaters, which are determined by a government regulation.

(11) When permitting the discharge of wastewater into surface or groundwaters, the water authority
a) shall take into account the need to achieve or maintain a good status of surface or groundwaters and of water-dependent ecosystems, and
b) shall assess the possibilities of reducing pollution at its source and reducing emissions into the environment as a whole, and the possibility of reusing wastewater.

(12) If required by the objectives set in the relevant river basin plan or water protection objectives or environmental quality standards set by a directly applicable regulation of the European Union, the water authority shall, in the permit, set stricter emission limits than the emission limits set under paragraph 10, or it may set additional indicators and their emission limits. The emission limits set by the water authority must not be stricter than the values achievable by using the best available techniques in the field of wastewater treatment⁵⁹). The stated procedure applies mutatis mutandis to cases of setting pollution indicators and emission standards established by a government regulation under §§ 31, 34, and 35.

(13) The water authority may, when permitting the discharge of wastewater from industrial buildings and facilities, impose the obligation to treat wastewater from individual partial production units or cooling waters separately from other wastewater.

(14) The water authority may, at the request of the polluter, permit in exceptional cases for a strictly necessary period, especially when putting a wastewater treatment plant into operation, during trial operation, necessary repairs or changes to the wastewater treatment facility, and in case of accidents of these facilities, and in cases where wastewater will be discharged into surface waters in a controlled manner, while simultaneously setting other conditions that limit the possibility of deteriorating the quality of surface waters, the discharge of wastewater with permissible values of wastewater pollution indicators higher than the values set by a government regulation under paragraph 10 or under § 31.

(15) In case of doubt as to whether it is wastewater, the water authority shall decide.

§ 39
Harmful Substances

(1) Harmful substances are substances that are not wastewater or mine water and which may endanger the quality of surface or groundwaters (hereinafter "harmful substances"). Anyone who handles harmful substances is obliged to take appropriate measures to prevent them from entering surface or groundwaters and endangering their environment.

(2) In cases where the user of harmful substances handles these substances on a larger scale or where handling them is associated with an increased risk to surface or groundwaters, the user of harmful substances is obliged to take these measures:
a) prepare a plan of measures for cases of an accident (hereinafter "contingency plan") and submit it for approval to the relevant water authority; if an accident may affect a watercourse, the user of harmful substances shall discuss it with the relevant watercourse administrator, to whom they shall also provide one copy, before submitting it for approval,
b) keep records of the measures taken and retain these records for a period of 5 years.

(3) A list of hazardous harmful substances and other substances or groups of substances that cause similar concern is provided in Annex No. 1 to this Act; this list also includes particularly hazardous harmful substances. A special category of hazardous harmful substances are priority substances, which represent a significant risk to the aquatic environment and related ecosystems. The list of priority substances is determined by the government by a regulation. Part of the list of priority substances is also the category of priority hazardous substances, which are substances that pose a very high risk in the aquatic environment or indirectly through the aquatic environment due to their persistence and bioaccumulation capacity. To reduce the pollution of surface and groundwaters by hazardous harmful substances and particularly hazardous harmful substances, the government may, at the proposal of the Ministry of the Environment, adopt a Programme for reducing the pollution of surface and groundwaters by hazardous harmful substances and particularly hazardous harmful substances.

(4) Anyone who handles particularly hazardous harmful substances or hazardous harmful substances or who handles harmful substances on a larger scale or where handling them is associated with an increased risk, is obliged to take appropriate measures to prevent them from entering surface or groundwaters or sewer systems that are not part of the technological equipment of the production facility. They are obliged in particular to
a) locate facilities in which harmful substances are used, collected, stored, processed, or transported in such a way as to prevent the undesirable leakage of these substances into the soil or their undesirable mixing with wastewater or stormwater,
b) use only such equipment, or possibly a method of handling harmful substances, that are suitable also from the perspective of water quality protection,
c) inspect warehouses and landfills, including the outlets of their control systems, at least once every 6 months to detect the leakage of harmful substances and to promptly carry out their timely repairs; warehouses must be secured by an impermeable treatment against the leakage of harmful substances into groundwaters,
d) at least once every 5 years, unless a shorter period is specified by a technical standard or the manufacturer, test the tightness of pipelines or tanks intended for the storage and means of transport of particularly hazardous harmful substances and hazardous harmful substances by a professionally competent person, and in case of detected deficiencies, to promptly carry out their timely repairs; the tightness of tanks intended for the storage of oil or petroleum products with a minimum volume of 1000 m³ or used for the storage of oil and petroleum products under the Act on Emergency Oil Stocks²¹b), secured by an impermeable treatment against the leakage of harmful substances into groundwaters and continuously monitored by control systems, the outputs of which are recorded and stored until the next tightness test, may, unless a shorter period is specified by the manufacturer, be tested at least once every 20 years; in the case of storing fertilizers and leachates from bulk feed or substances intended for the treatment of water for drinking purposes and for the treatment of municipal wastewater in above-ground tanks located in containment basins with a volume greater than the volume of the largest tank located in them, a repeated tightness test is not required,
e) build and operate an appropriate control system for detecting the leakage of harmful substances and submit its outputs at the request of the water authority or the Czech Environmental Inspectorate,
f) ensure that newly constructed buildings are secured against the undesirable leakage of these substances during firefighting.

(5) The measures under paragraph 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the used packaging of harmful substances.

(6) Anyone who handles particularly hazardous harmful substances is obliged to keep records of the types of these substances that are processed or handled, of their quantity, of the content of their active components, of their properties, especially in relation to surface and groundwaters, and to provide this information upon request to the water authority and the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic.

TITLE VI
WATERCOURSES

§ 43
Watercourses

(1) Watercourses are surface waters flowing under their own gradient in a bed permanently or for the predominant part of the year, including waters artificially impounded in them. Their components are also waters in oxbow lakes and in sections temporarily flowing through natural cavities under the earth's surface or covered sections.

(2) In case of doubt as to whether it is a watercourse, the water authority shall decide. It may also decide that other surface waters than those mentioned in paragraph 1 are watercourses.

(3) The provisions of a special act²⁵) concerning torrent control are not affected.

§ 44
Beds of Watercourses

(1) If a watercourse flows over a land that is registered in the Real Estate Cadastre as a water body, the bed of the watercourse is this land. If a watercourse flows over a land that is not registered in the Real Estate Cadastre as a water body, the bed of the watercourse is the part of the land comprising the bottom and banks of the bed up to the bank line determined by the water level that is usually sufficient to flow through this bed without overflowing into the adjacent area.

(2) The natural bed of a watercourse is a bed or its part that was created by the natural action of flowing surface waters and other natural factors or by the implementation of remedial measures for interventions caused by human activity or the removal of a waterwork for the purpose of restoring the natural bed of a minor watercourse, and which can change its direction, longitudinal slope, and cross-sectional profile.

(3) In case of doubt about the boundary of a watercourse bed or whether it is a natural watercourse bed, the locally competent water authority shall decide.

§ 45
Changes to a Watercourse Bed

(1) If a watercourse leaves its natural bed during a flood due to natural forces and a new bed is thereby created, the owners of the land, the watercourse administrator, as well as those with rights to manage the waters who are affected by the new state, may individually or jointly request a permit from the water authority to return the watercourse to its original bed at their own expense. The state may contribute to the restoration of the watercourse bed after a flood for applicants who receive a permit (§ 102).

(2) If the original state is not restored, the state shall purchase the land of the original or new watercourse bed if the owner of the affected land offers it to the state. This does not apply to affected lands owned by municipalities.

(3) If the original state is not restored because the water authority did not permit the restoration in the public interest, the owners of the affected lands are entitled to compensation under paragraph 2, and the other parties with rights to manage the waters, affected by this decision, are entitled to reasonable compensation.

The Ministry of Agriculture decides on the designation as an administrator and the revocation of an administrator of a minor watercourse on the basis of an application; this does not apply in the case of designating or revoking a state organizational unit or state enterprise as an administrator, whose object of business or activity is the administration of minor watercourses. Simultaneously with the designation of a state organizational unit or state enterprise as an administrator of a minor watercourse, for which the previous administrator was a state organizational unit or state enterprise, the right to manage the lands with the bed of such a watercourse, the waterworks associated with such a watercourse, and the lands under these waterworks, passes from the previous to the new administrator of the minor watercourse, if these properties are owned by the state.

(3) In the territory of military districts²⁹), the administration of minor watercourses is ensured by the Ministry of Defence. In the territory of national parks, the administration of minor watercourses is ensured by the National Park Administrations; for the purposes of this Act, the Ministry of Defence and the National Park Administrations are considered administrators of watercourses.

(4) On minor watercourses for which no administrator has been designated, their administration is carried out by the administrator of the watercourse to which the minor watercourse is a tributary, until such time as an administrator is designated under paragraph 2. This also applies if there is an integral section of a minor watercourse on a minor watercourse for which no administrator has been designated, for which an administrator has been designated.

(5) The content of the application under paragraph 2 and its particulars necessary for the issuance of the decision shall be determined by the Ministry of Agriculture by decree.

(6) The river basin administrator supervises the administration of minor watercourses. If the administrator of a minor watercourse fails to fulfill its obligations under this Act, the Ministry of Agriculture may, at the proposal of the river basin administrator, revoke the designation as an administrator of the minor watercourse.

§ 49

(2) An authorization to carry out a technical review of a waterwork notified under § 15a may be granted to a person who has a sufficient level of professional, technical, administrative, and organizational background and meets the prerequisites for a qualified performance of the review.

(3) The water authority may impose on the owner of a waterwork the obligation to prepare and submit to it for approval a manipulation plan for the waterwork; it may also set the conditions under which it issues the decision on approval, and a deadline for submitting or for the submitted manipulation plan, impose the obligation to supplement it or make other modifications. It may also impose a change to the approved manipulation plan of the waterwork and its submission for approval. The water authority approves the manipulation plan for a limited period.

(4) The owner of a waterwork notified under § 15a para. 3 shall prepare and submit a manipulation plan to the water authority for approval no later than with the application for a final use permit under the Building Act.

(5) In exceptional cases, the water authority may impose or permit the owner of a waterwork an extraordinary manipulation on the waterwork beyond the scope of the approved manipulation plan. In such a case, the owner of the waterwork does not have an obligation to compensate the person entitled to manage waters in this work for not being able to manage waters in the maximum permitted quantity and with certain properties.

(6) If required by the public interest and if the person who is obliged to do so does not properly fulfill these obligations and has not remedied the situation within a set deadline, the water authority may decide that another person shall take over the operation or maintenance of the waterworks for a strictly necessary period. This operation and maintenance shall be provided by the designated person at the expense of the one who was obliged to fulfill these obligations; if there is no such person, these costs are borne by the state.

(7) The state participates in the removal of obstacles to the migration of aquatic animals in a watercourse caused by waterworks built before the effective date of this Act.

§ 59a

(2) If damage is caused to the landowner by entry to the land, they are entitled to its compensation.

§ 61
Technical Safety Supervision over Waterworks

(1) Technical safety supervision over waterworks (hereinafter "technical safety supervision") is understood as the assessment of the technical condition of a waterwork from the perspective of safety and stability and the possible causes of their failures. It is carried out in particular by observing and inspecting the waterwork, measuring its deformations, monitoring water seepage, as well as evaluating the results of all observations and measurements in relation to predetermined limit or critical values. Part of the technical safety supervision is also the preparation of proposals for measures to remedy identified deficiencies.

(2) Waterworks that serve for the impoundment and retention of water are subject to technical safety supervision. These are
a) dams, dikes, and weirs, with the exception of transverse structures in the beds of watercourses and adjacent areas whose height from the toe of the dam to the crest is less than 1 m and the total volume of impounded water does not exceed 1,000 m³, or fixed and immovable transverse impounding structures in the beds of watercourses whose fixed overflow crest is less than 1.5 m above the downstream riverbed,
b) structures for flood protection,
c) structures established for navigation purposes in the beds of watercourses or on their banks,
d) structures for the utilization of the energy potential of surface waters, with the exception of the transverse structures mentioned in letter a), and
e) other structures serving for the impoundment or retention of water, with the exception of reservoirs completely sunk into the ground without an impounding element, oxbow lakes, water mains and reservoirs, sewer networks, and recreational pools.

(3) Furthermore, the following structures are subject to technical safety supervision:
a) tailings ponds and
b) hydrotechnical adits and tunnels.

(4) From the perspective of technical safety supervision, waterworks are divided into categories I to IV according to the risk of endangering human lives, possible damage to property in the adjacent area, and losses from the restriction of functions and uses in the public interest.

(5) The criteria and procedure for the classification of waterworks into categories, the scope and frequency of carrying out technical safety supervision for individual categories of waterworks and in individual stages of their preparation, construction, modification of the completed waterwork, or operation, the particulars of preparing the scope of technical safety supervision measurements, the particulars of the technical safety supervision program, and the processing of the results of observations and measurements shall be determined by the Ministry of Agriculture by decree.

(6) The applicant for a permit for a new or modified completed waterwork is obliged to submit with the application for a permit an expert opinion for the classification of the waterwork into a category with a proposal of conditions for carrying out technical safety supervision, which is prepared by a person mentioned in paragraph 11. The expert opinion for the classification of the waterwork into a category contains the determination of the degree of safety of the waterwork during floods and a proposal and assessment of the parameters of safety and outlet facilities in accordance with special legal regulations⁶¹), ⁶²).

(7) The water authority shall decide on the obligation to ensure technical safety supervision on a waterwork, on its scope, possibly on the conditions of its implementation, and on the classification of the waterwork into category I to IV, taking into account the expert opinion under the preceding paragraph, usually within the framework of the permit for the construction or its modification. The regional authority may reserve the issuance of this decision for waterworks whose impact under paragraph 2 extends beyond the territory of the relevant water authority, and in the case of an impact under paragraph 2 extending beyond the territory of the region, the Ministry of Agriculture.

(8) If it is a waterwork under § 15a para. 3, subject to technical safety supervision, with the consent of the water authority to the notification, this waterwork is considered classified into category IV of technical safety supervision according to the expert opinion submitted with the notification. The scope, or possibly conditions, of technical safety supervision are considered determined by the consent of the water authority to the notification.

(9) The water authority may decide on a change in the category of a waterwork, the scope of technical safety supervision, or the conditions of its implementation, if the conditions under which the previous decision was issued have significantly changed.

(10) The Ministry of Agriculture manages the records of technical safety supervision, including the classification of waterworks into categories I to IV. The scope of data and the method of keeping the records of technical safety supervision shall be determined by the Ministry of Agriculture by decree.

(11) Technical safety supervision over waterworks of categories I to III, including the preparation of a technical safety supervision program and the preparation of the scope of technical safety supervision measurements, the preparation of expert opinions for the classification of waterworks into categories I to IV from the perspective of technical safety supervision may only be carried out by an authorized person within the scope of their authorization. If such a person is the owner of a waterwork of category I or II, they may not carry out technical safety supervision on it themselves nor prepare a technical safety supervision program for it.

(12) The authorized person is obliged to
a) ensure the continuous performance of technical safety supervision in the required scope and with the required personnel, even during floods, natural disasters, and crisis situations,
b) notify the Ministry of Agriculture of a transformation of the legal person and a change in the personnel, material, and technical equipment related to the performance of technical safety supervision, immediately after the realization of this change,

(16) The Ministry of Agriculture shall, by decree, determine the scope of selected data, the method of keeping the records of technical safety supervision, and the method of transmitting this data under paragraphs 12 and 13.

§ 62
Obligations of Owners and Builders of Waterworks during Technical Safety Supervision

(1) The owner, or possibly the builder, of a waterwork is obliged to ensure technical safety supervision at their own expense, to the extent determined by a decree of the Ministry of Agriculture under § 61 para. 5. The water authority may, by a decision, set further obligations for the implementation of this supervision.

(2) For waterworks classified into categories I to III, their owner, or possibly the builder, is obliged to ensure technical safety supervision through an authorized person and to participate in its implementation to the extent determined by a decree of the Ministry of Agriculture. For waterworks of category III, the owner or builder may carry out technical safety supervision themselves if they are an authorized person.

(3) For waterworks of category IV, the owner, or possibly the builder, may carry out technical safety supervision themselves.

(4) The owner, or possibly the builder, is obliged, for waterworks classified into categories I to III, to immediately notify the Ministry of Agriculture of the designation of an authorized person, or of its change. The same applies to waterworks of category IV, for which the owner, or possibly the builder, does not carry out technical safety supervision themselves, but through an authorized person.

(5) When carrying out technical safety supervision, the owner, or possibly the builder, of a waterwork classified into categories I to IV is obliged to
a) designate a natural person responsible for the performance of technical safety supervision and to notify their name, surname, residential address, or possibly workplace address, and telephone number to the relevant water authority; for waterworks of category IV, the owner of the waterwork is considered the person responsible for technical safety supervision, unless they have designated another person,

TITLE IX
FLOOD PROTECTION

Division 1
Flood Protection

§ 63

(1) Flood protection means activities and measures to prevent and manage flood risk in a threatened area. It is ensured through systematic prevention and operational measures.

(2) Operational measures are ensured according to flood plans and, upon the declaration of a state of crisis, according to crisis plans.³⁴)

(3) To ensure flood protection, everyone is obliged to allow entry, or possibly passage, onto their lands, or possibly structures, to those who direct, coordinate, and carry out securing and rescue work, to contribute with personal and material assistance at the order of flood authorities to the protection of lives and property from floods, and to follow the orders of flood authorities.

(4) If damage is caused to the owner of the land or structure during this activity, they are entitled to its compensation.

§ 64
Floods

(1) For the purposes of this Act, floods are understood as a temporary significant increase in the water level of watercourses or other surface waters, during which water already floods the area outside the watercourse bed and may cause damage. A flood is also a state where water may cause damage by not being able to drain naturally from a certain area in a timely manner or its runoff is insufficient, or when an area is flooded by concentrated runoff of stormwater. A flood may be caused by natural phenomena, especially melting, rainfall, or the movement of ice (natural flood), or by other influences, especially a failure of a waterwork, which can lead to its collapse (breach) or an emergency solution to a critical situation on the waterwork (special flood).

(2) A flood begins with the declaration of the second or third degree of flood activity (§ 70) and ends with the revocation of the third degree of flood activity, unless the second degree of flood activity is declared at the time of the revocation of the third degree of flood activity. In that case, the flood ends with the revocation of the second degree of flood activity. A flood is also the situation described in paragraph 1, in which the second or third degree of flood activity was not declared, but the water level or flow in the relevant profile or precipitation reached a normative level for one of these degrees of flood activity according to the flood plan of the relevant territorial unit. In case of doubt as to whether a flood occurred in a certain area and at a certain time, the water authority shall decide, if any of these conditions are met.

(3) The danger of a flood is considered to be a situation, especially when
a) a specified limit of the water level or flow in a watercourse and its rising trend is reached,
b) prolonged heavy rainfall, or a forecast of the danger of intense rainfall, expected sudden melting, dangerous movement of ice, or the formation of dangerous ice jams and accumulations, or
c) an extraordinary situation arises on a waterwork, where there is a danger of its failure.

§ 64a
Flood Risk Management

(1) Flood risk management focuses on mitigating the potential adverse effects of floods on human health, the environment, cultural heritage, and economic activity, and, where considered appropriate, on non-structural measures or on reducing the probability of flooding.

(2) Flood risk is understood as the combination of the probability of a flood occurring and its potential adverse effects on human health, the environment, cultural heritage, and economic activity.

(3) A preliminary assessment of flood risks is the basis for defining areas with significant flood risk. For these areas, flood hazard maps, flood risk maps, and flood risk management plans are prepared or updated.

(4) Flood hazard maps define areas that could be flooded according to different flood scenarios and using established floodplains. Flood risk maps indicate the potential adverse consequences of floods according to these scenarios.

(5) Flood risk management plans are part of water planning and take into account important aspects such as costs and benefits, the extent and course of floods, the retention capacity of floodplains, water protection objectives under § 23a para. 1, land and water resource management, land-use planning, land use, nature protection, navigation, and port infrastructure. Flood risk management plans address all aspects of flood risk management, focusing on prevention, protection, and preparedness, including flood forecasts and early warning systems, and taking into account the characteristics of the specific river basin or sub-basin. Flood risk management plans may also include the promotion of sustainable land use, improvement of soil's water retention capacity, and controlled flooding of certain areas in the event of a flood.

Division 2

(4) Measures after a flood are
a) record-keeping and documentation work,
b) evaluation of the flood situation, including the resulting flood damages,
c) the removal of flood damages and the restoration of the area after a flood.

(5) Flood measures under paragraphs 1 to 4 do not include the construction, maintenance, and repair of structures and other facilities serving for flood protection, as well as investments induced by floods.

§ 66
Floodplains

(1) Floodplains are administratively designated areas that can be flooded by water during the occurrence of a natural flood. Their extent must be determined by the water authority at the proposal of the watercourse administrator. The water authority may impose on the watercourse administrator the obligation to prepare and submit such a proposal in accordance with the plans of the main river basins and the plans of the river basin districts.

(2) In built-up areas, in areas designated for development according to land-use planning documentation, or where necessary in other areas, the water authority shall, at the proposal of the watercourse administrator, define an active zone of the floodplain according to the danger of flood flows.

(3) The method and scope of preparing the proposal and determining floodplains and their documentation shall be determined by the Ministry of the Environment by decree.

(4) The water authority that has established a floodplain shall ensure that the documentation is made accessible and shall hand over one copy of this documentation to the Ministry of the Environment.

(5) If floodplains are not designated, the water and building authorities and land-use planning bodies may, in their activities, rely in particular on the available documents from river basin administrators and watercourse administrators on the probable boundary of the area threatened by floods.

(6) The Ministry of the Environment, based on the documents of the watercourse administrators, ensures the management of the documentation on established floodplains in the territory of the Czech Republic and ensures their registration in the public administration information system.

(7) Floodplains and their active zones are established by a measure of a general nature.

(8) When changing floodplains and their active zones, paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

§ 67
Restrictions in Floodplains

(1) In the active zone of floodplains, it is prohibited to locate, permit, or construct structures, with the exception of waterworks by which the watercourse is regulated, flood flows are diverted, flood protection measures are carried out, or which are otherwise related to the watercourse or improve runoff conditions, structures for water collection, wastewater disposal, and stormwater drainage, and further necessary transport and technical infrastructure structures, the establishment of hop-growing structures, if they are established in a floodplain in cadastral areas defined under Act No. 97/1996 Coll., on the protection of hops, as amended, on the condition that such measures will be simultaneously taken that will minimize the impact on flood flows; this does not apply to the maintenance of structures and structural modifications, provided there is no deterioration of runoff conditions.

(2) In the active zone, it is also prohibited to
a) extract minerals and soil in a way that worsens the runoff of surface waters and carry out land modifications that worsen the runoff of surface waters,
b) store floatable material, substances, and objects,
c) erect fences, hedges, and other similar obstacles,
d) establish camps, campsites, and other temporary accommodation facilities; this does not apply to the establishment of camps consisting only of tents, which were established at this location before the establishment of the active zone of the floodplain and which can be immediately removed in case of flood danger.

(3) Outside the active zone in a floodplain, the water authority shall, according to the flood hazard or flood threat, by a measure of a general nature, establish restrictive conditions. When conditions change, it may change or abolish them by the same procedure. It shall proceed in this way also if the active zone is not established.

§ 68
Areas Designated for Controlled Flood Spills

(1) Areas designated for controlled flood spills are considered to be lands necessary for the impoundment, or possibly accumulation, of surface waters by public-benefit flood protection structures, for which the ownership right has been restricted by agreement or by the procedure under § 55a.

(2) For damage caused by a controlled flood spill to land, field crops, forest stands, and structures in the area under paragraph 1, the affected party is entitled to compensation, which is provided in money by the state, represented by the Ministry of Agriculture. The amount of compensation for damage caused to land or a structure is determined based on the amount of costs necessary to restore the land or structure to its original state, including the costs of removing undesirable deposits; the amount of compensation for damage caused to field crops is determined based on the market prices of the field crops at the time of the spill, including the costs of liquidating the damaged field crops; the amount of compensation for damage caused to forest stands is determined according to the Forest Act³³a). The procedure for determining and claiming compensation and the procedure for determining its amount shall be determined by the government by a regulation.

(3) Compensation is also due for financial loss incurred by the loss of entitlement to a subsidy provided under the Agriculture Act, which the affected party lost in connection with a controlled flood spill.

(4) The affected party to whom compensation has been provided under paragraph 2 cannot be provided with state aid on account of a flood spill under the Act on state aid for the restoration of a territory affected by a natural or other disaster.

(5) The affected party is not entitled to compensation if they do not comply with the conditions set for the use of lands designated for flood spills.

§ 69
Areas Threatened by Special Floods

Areas threatened by special floods are areas that can be flooded by water during the occurrence of a special flood. If the expected extent of an area threatened by a special flood for crisis situations significantly exceeds the floodplains, their extent shall be defined in the crisis plan. A special act applies to its preparation.³⁴)

§ 70
Degrees of Flood Activity

(1) Degrees of flood activity for the purposes of this Act are a measure of flood danger tied to normative limits, which are usually water levels or flows in reporting profiles on watercourses, or possibly limit or critical values of another phenomenon specified in the relevant flood plan.

(2) The scope of operational measures carried out for protection against a specific flood is governed by the danger or development of the flood situation, which is expressed by three degrees of flood activity, which are:
a) the first degree (state of vigilance) occurs at the danger of a natural flood and ceases when the causes of such danger have passed; this state also occurs upon the issuance of a warning information by the flood forecasting service; it requires increased attention to the watercourse or other source of flood danger, activates the warning and patrol service; on waterworks, this state occurs when the limit values of monitored phenomena and facts from the perspective of the work's safety are reached or when extraordinary circumstances are identified that could lead to the occurrence of a special flood,
b) the second degree (state of alert) is declared when the danger of a natural flood develops into a flood, but there are no major spills and damages outside the bed; it is also declared when the limit values of monitored phenomena and facts on a waterwork from the perspective of its safety are exceeded; flood authorities and other participants in flood protection are activated, means for securing works are put on alert, measures to mitigate the course of the flood are carried out according to the flood plan,
c) the third degree (state of danger) is declared in the immediate danger or occurrence of damages of a greater scope, the threat to lives and property in the floodplain; it is also declared when critical values of monitored phenomena and facts on a waterwork from the perspective of its safety are reached, simultaneously with the initiation of emergency measures; flood securing works are carried out according to the flood plans and, if necessary, rescue work or evacuation.

(3) The second and third degrees of flood activity are declared and revoked in their territorial district by the flood authorities. The basis is the achievement or the forecast of the achievement of the normative limit of levels or flows specified in the flood plans, a report from the flood forecasting or warning service, a recommendation from the watercourse administrator, a notification from the owner of a waterwork, or possibly other facts characterizing the degree of flood danger. The flood authority is obliged to inform the subjects specified in the flood plan and the higher flood authority of the declaration and revocation of flood activity.

(4) The normative limits of water levels for declaring the degrees of flood activity are contained in the flood plans and are binding for the flood plans of lower levels.

§ 71
Flood Plans

(1) Flood plans, for the purposes of this Act, are understood as documents that contain the method of ensuring timely and reliable information on the development of a flood, the possibilities of influencing the runoff regime, the organization and preparation of securing works; they also contain the method of ensuring the timely activation of flood authorities, securing the warning and patrol service and the protection of structures, the preparation and organization of rescue works, and ensuring the basic functions that have been disrupted by the flood in structures and in the area, and the established normative limits for the degrees of flood activity.

(2) The content of flood plans is divided into
a) a factual part, which includes data necessary for ensuring the protection against floods of a specific structure, municipality, river basin, or other territorial unit, normative limits for declaring the degrees of flood activity,
b) an organizational part, which contains lists of names, addresses, and the method of contacting the participants in flood protection, tasks for individual participants in flood protection, including the organization of the warning and patrol service,
c) a graphical part, which usually contains maps or plans on which floodplains, evacuation routes and assembly points, reporting profiles, and information points are marked.

(3) The flood plans of territorial units are
a) the flood plans of municipalities, which are prepared by the municipal authorities in whose territorial districts a flood may occur,
b) the flood plans of the administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers, which are prepared by the municipalities with extended powers,
c) the flood plans of the administrative districts of regions, which are prepared by the relevant regional authorities in their delegated capacity in cooperation with the river basin administrators,
d) the Flood Plan of the Czech Republic, which is prepared by the Ministry of the Environment.

(4) For structures threatened by floods, which are located in a floodplain or may worsen the course of a flood, their owners shall prepare flood plans for their own needs and for cooperation with the flood authority of the municipality. In case of doubt about the extent of this obligation or about which structures may worsen the course of a flood, the water authority shall decide.

(5) The water authority may impose an obligation to prepare a flood plan on the owners of lands that are located in floodplains, if it is necessary with regard to the manner of their use.

(6) The preparers of the flood plans of territorial units (paragraph 3) shall review their topicality annually, usually before the spring thaw period, and shall document this review. The preparers of other flood plans (paragraph 4) shall review them in case of substantial changes in the conditions under which they were prepared. If the review shows a need for amendment or supplementation of the flood plan, the preparers shall do so immediately.

(7) The factual and graphical parts of the flood plan of territorial units and their amendments are submitted by the preparers to the superior flood authority for confirmation of compliance with the flood plan of a higher level. For flood plans of lands and structures, compliance is confirmed by the flood authority of the municipality. If a structure significantly extends beyond the territory of the municipality in its scope or impact on the surroundings, the superior flood authority confirms the compliance and informs the lower flood authorities thereof. By confirming compliance, the factual and graphical parts of the flood plan become binding. The preparers shall continuously update the organizational part of the flood plan and provide it to the affected flood authorities and participants in the management of flood protection for use, if it is not accessible to them on the public administration portal in electronic form.

§ 72
Flood Inspections

(1) Flood inspections determine whether there are any defects on watercourses, waterworks, and in floodplains, or on objects or facilities located in these areas, that could increase the danger of a flood or its harmful consequences.

(2) Flood inspections are organized and carried out by flood authorities according to the flood plans, at least once a year.

(3) Flood authorities may, on the basis of a flood inspection, call upon the owners of lands, structures, and facilities in a floodplain to remove objects and facilities that may worsen runoff conditions or block the bed downstream. If these owners do not comply with the call within the specified deadline, such an obligation shall be imposed by a decision.

§ 73
Flood Forecasting and Warning Service

(1) The flood forecasting service informs the flood authorities, and where applicable, other participants in flood protection, about the danger of a flood occurring, about its occurrence and further dangerous development, about hydrometeorological elements characterizing the origin and development of a flood, especially about precipitation, water levels, and flows in selected profiles. This service is provided by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in cooperation with the river basin administrator.

(2) The flood warning service ensures information for flood authorities for warning the population in the place of an expected flood and in places located downstream on the watercourse, informs the flood authorities and participants in flood protection about the development of the flood situation, and transmits reports and messages necessary for its evaluation and for the management of flood protection measures. The flood warning service is organized by the flood authorities of municipalities and the flood authorities for the administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers, and other participants in flood protection participate in it. To ensure the flood warning service, the flood authorities of municipalities organize a patrol service if necessary.

(3) Owners of waterworks impounding water shall notify the relevant flood authorities, the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic, of the danger of a special flood and, in case of imminent danger, shall warn the immediately threatened natural and legal persons.

(4) The operational and information centers of the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic and the components of the integrated rescue system³⁵) are used for the transmission of information by the flood forecasting and warning service.

§ 74
Flood Rescue Works

(1) Flood rescue works are technical and organizational measures carried out during a flood in the immediately threatened or already flooded areas to save lives and property, especially the protection and evacuation of the population from these areas, their care for a strictly necessary period, the rescue of property and its relocation outside the threatened area.

(2) Flood rescue works in cases where human lives or economic interests, such as transport, supply, communications, and healthcare, are threatened, are ensured by the flood authorities in cooperation with the components of the integrated rescue system.

§ 75
Flood Securing Works

(1) Flood securing works are technical measures carried out during the danger of a flood and during a flood to mitigate the course of the flood and its harmful consequences.

(2) Flood securing works are in particular
a) the removal of obstacles in the watercourse and in the profile of objects (culverts, bridges) that prevent the smooth flow of water,
b) the breaking up of ice jams and accumulations in the watercourse,
c) the protection of the bed and banks against erosion by the flood flow and the securing of bank slides,
d) measures against the overtopping or breaching of protective dikes,
e) measures against the overtopping or breaching of the dikes of waterworks retaining water,
f) the temporary closing of breached dikes,
g) the installation of flood barriers,
h) measures against backwater, especially into sewer systems,
i) measures to limit water pollution,
j) measures ensuring the stability of the area against landslides.

(3) Flood securing works are ensured by the administrators of watercourses on the watercourses and by the owners of the affected objects, and where applicable, by other subjects according to the flood plans or at the order of the flood authorities. Securing works that may affect runoff conditions and the course of a flood must be coordinated in cooperation with the relevant river basin administrator for the entire watercourse or the entire river basin. Securing works carried out on waterworks classified into category I or II are discussed with the person authorized to carry out technical safety supervision (§ 61 para. 11), unless there is a risk of delay.

§ 76
Documentation and Evaluation of Floods

(1) The purpose of documentation is to ensure conclusive and objective records of the course of a flood, of the measures taken for flood protection, of the cause and extent of damages, and of other circumstances related to the flood. For this purpose, records in the flood log, continuous records of water levels and indicative values of velocities and flows, continuous records of data on the operation of waterworks affecting the course of a flood, marking of the highest reached water level, surveying and mapping of the inundation, monitoring of water quality and possible sources of pollution, photographic images and film recordings, purposeful field surveys, and investigations serve in particular.

(2) The flood authorities of municipalities and municipalities with extended powers and the participants in flood protection, who are obliged by law to do so, shall prepare a report on the flood during which flood activity was declared, flood damages occurred, or flood securing and rescue works were carried out.
