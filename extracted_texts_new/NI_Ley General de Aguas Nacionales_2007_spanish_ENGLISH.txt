II That it is the right of the indigenous peoples and ethnic communities of the Caribbean Coast to enjoy, use, and benefit from the waters found within their communal lands, under the precepts established in the corresponding laws. III That numerous efforts have been made in recent years by the National Water Resources Commission, within the framework of the Action Plan for the Management of Water Resources in Nicaragua (PARH), and by the organized population itself, for the formulation and drafting of a Law to regulate the use of and access to water resources, but these efforts have not come to fruition for various technical and political reasons. IV That in the absence of a legal framework for water resources in Nicaragua, it is necessary to legislate in order to establish the institutional framework, the legal regime for the sustainable use and exploitation of the resource, as well as the relationships between institutions and the private parties involved, and citizen organization and participation in the management of the resource. It is also necessary to define water as a finite and vulnerable resource essential for existence and development, constituting a strategic natural resource for the country, and therefore, access to it is a right associated with life and human health that must be guaranteed by the State to the Nicaraguan people. THEREFORE In use of its powers Has ordered the following: GENERAL LAW OF NATIONAL WATERS TITLE I GENERAL PROVISIONS Chapter I Purpose and Scope of Application Article 1 The purpose of this Law is to establish the institutional legal framework for the administration, conservation, development, sustainable and equitable use, exploitation, and preservation in quantity 5664 and quality of all water resources existing in the country, whether they be surface, underground, wastewater, or of any other nature, while also guaranteeing the protection of other natural resources, ecosystems, and the environment. Art. 2 The specific objectives of this Law are: a) To order and regulate the integrated management of water resources based on the country's hydrographic and hydrogeological watersheds, sub-watersheds, and micro-watersheds. b) To create and define the functions and powers of the institutions responsible for the administration of the water sector and the duties and rights of users, as well as to guarantee citizen participation in the management of the resource. c) To regulate the granting of rights for the use or exploitation of water resources and their associated assets. Art. 3 Water is a national heritage whose use and enjoyment are regulated by this Law and its Regulations. The provisions contained in this Law are of public order and social interest throughout the National territory and are applicable to all water resources, whatever their state or condition. In order to regulate specific legal aspects not contemplated in these provisions, Special Regulations subordinate to the principles, objectives, and scope of this Law may be approved. Matters corresponding to potable water and sanitary sewer services, hydroelectric power generation, and irrigation shall be administered by the respective sectoral institutions in accordance with current legislation. Art. 4 Potable water service shall not be subject to any privatization, direct or indirect, and shall always be considered of a public nature. Its administration, oversight, and control shall be under the responsibility and tutelage of the State through the institutions created for such purposes or those that may be created in the future. Art. 5 It is the indeclinable obligation and priority of the State to promote, facilitate, and properly regulate the supply of potable water in quantity and quality to the Nicaraguan people, at differentiated costs and favoring sectors with fewer economic resources. The provision of this vital service to consumers in an evident state of extreme poverty may not be interrupted, except in cases of force majeure, and in any case, they must be provided with temporary supply alternatives, whether at fixed or mobile points. Nor may these services be interrupted for hospitals, health centers, schools, orphanages, nursing homes, penitentiary centers, fire stations, and public markets. Art. 6 This Law recognizes the right of the Indigenous Peoples throughout the national territory and of the Ethnic Communities of the Atlantic Coast to the use and enjoyment of the waters found within their communal lands, in accordance with the current laws that regulate them. Chapter II The Legal Regime of Waters and Their Associated Assets Art. 7 Surface or underground waters found in the continental part of the national territory and the natural elements that make up the hydrographic watersheds, whatever their state, quality, and situation, belong to the Nation, and the State exercises eminent domain over them in accordance with the provisions of this Law and its Regulations. 4-09-07 LA GACETA - OFFICIAL JOURNAL Art. 8 The Nation's ownership regime over the waters shall subsist even when the waters, through the construction of works, are diverted from their original channels or basins, their flow into them is impeded, or they are subjected to treatment. Wastewater resulting from the use of national waters shall also be subject to the same ownership regime when discharged into receiving bodies of national property. Art. 9 The State's domain over all national waters also includes the following national assets: a) The terrain of the beds or channels of natural, navigable, or floatable watercourses, in accordance with the provisions of the current Civil Code; b) The beds of lakes, lagoons, and estuaries uncovered by natural causes or by artificial works; c) Maritime, river, and lake beaches to the extent fixed by the corresponding legislation; d) For the purpose of protecting the resource, saline lands; e) The firm land extending up to two hundred meters beyond the high tide line and thirty meters on each side of the edge of the permanent channel of rivers and lakes. f) Public works for water regulation and exploitation, including the installations, real estate, and lands they occupy. g) Islands that exist or are formed in the basins of lakes, lagoons, estuaries, reservoirs, and deposits, or in the channels of nationally owned watercourses, except for those formed when a current separates land of private or communal property. Art. 10 Maritime waters shall be governed by the provisions of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua and by the laws on the matter, except when they are used: a) As a source of supply of any kind; b) For use in aquaculture or fish farms located on firm land or in the waters of estuaries and bays; c) For the artificial breeding and development of finfish and crustacean species; d) For industrial uses; e) As an agent for the generation of electrical energy or any other type; f) For their desalination for the production of fresh water in substitution of continental waters; g) For the extraction of salt of marine origin, and h) When they are the destination of discharges, or when it is a matter of protecting them against pollution.

TITLE II VALUES AND GOVERNING PRINCIPLES, MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS, WATER PLANNING, AND DECLARATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY Chapter I Governing Principles of Water Resources Art. 13 Without prejudice to the provisions of Decree 107-2001, "National Water Resources Policy," published in La Gaceta, Official Journal No. 233 of December 7, 2001, this Law is based on the following values and principles: a) Strategic resource. Water is a strategic resource for the economic and social development of the country. Water issues are a matter of national priority, and its use, efficient exploitation, quality, and actions for protection against floods and droughts are necessary conditions to sustainably support economic and social development and to guarantee the basic supply for present and future generations; b) Knowledge. Knowledge of the country's water resources is a high priority for the State, as an indispensable element for the sustainable management 169 of the resource. The State shall provide the necessary resources for the installation, operation, and maintenance of meteorological, hydrological, and hydrogeological networks; c) Preservation and defense. Water is a vital, limited, vulnerable, and finite resource whose preservation and sustainability is a fundamental and indeclinable task of the State and of society as a whole. Access to it is an inalienable right of every human being; d) Responsible administration. Water is a natural resource that must be protected and managed responsibly; its permanent and continuous access is a right intrinsically linked to life. Providing its supply for human consumption represents a maximum national priority; e) Integrated management. Water management is based on the integrated management of surface and underground watersheds, the multiple use of waters, and the interrelation that exists between the resource and the air, soil, flora, fauna, and biodiversity; f) Citizen Participation. The State must ensure the participation of all groups and stakeholders in the formulation and implementation of the national water policy and the corresponding plans and programs, through processes that place decisions as close as possible to those directly affected by them; g) Responsibility. Natural or legal persons who pollute water resources must assume the responsibility of paying the costs of restoring their quality; and those who make efficient and clean use of water will be entitled to incentives, including those of a fiscal nature; h) Harmonious Coordination. There must be harmonious coordination between state entities in order to strengthen and improve their own actions or functions, avoiding overlap and conflict of competencies; i) Precaution. Precaution shall prevail when there is reasonable doubt about the possible negative impact on the water resource or the watershed. The competent authority shall determine if there is sufficient cause to impose the preventive measures and sanctions it deems necessary to avoid damage; and j) Subsidiary Rigor. The principle of subsidiary rigor, which applies in cases where the measures for planning, administration, protection, and control of water, issued by regional or local entities within their sphere of competence, are more rigorous than those issued by the Water Authority. Chapter II Management Instruments Art. 14 The management instruments for water resources are: a) The National Water Resources Policy (PNRH). This is the master instrument for the integrated management of the water resource. This policy guides the other water management instruments; b) The legal framework. This includes all legal provisions, such as laws, regulations, technical standards, and administrative provisions, that regulate water resources; c) The system of concessions, licenses, and authorizations. Its objective is to ensure the quantitative and qualitative control of water use, as well as the effective exercise of the rights of access to water; d) The collection of fees for the use, exploitation, discharge, and protection of water resources. With the aim of giving the user and society 5667 4-09-07 LA GACETA - OFFICIAL JOURNAL clear indications of the real value of water and the ways its costs affect its price, the provision of water services, and its conservation, as well as to incentivize, through relevant processes and mechanisms, the rationalization of water use and reuse and to obtain economic resources for the financing of water planning; e) Payment for environmental services of the water resource. Its purpose is to develop the necessary economic, technical, legal, and environmental bases to implement a consistent and widespread system of payment for these environmental services that originate from the country's hydrographic watersheds; f) Social instruments. Used to secure access to the water resource for the benefit of agrarian communities and urban areas located in marginalized zones; g) The National Water Resources Information System. Composed mainly of geographic, meteorological, hydrological, and hydrogeological information, it includes the management of databases, the operation and maintenance of networks, and the dissemination of the information obtained; h) Economic and fiscal incentives. Intended to support the development and implementation of public and private plans, programs, and projects that contribute to the preservation, use, and exploitation of the national water resource, as well as for the improvement of water quality and its recirculation and reuse, including the promotion of research and sectoral technological development; and i) Social support. These allow access to the water resource for the benefit of agrarian communities and urban areas located in marginalized zones. Chapter III Water Planning Art. 15 Water planning and other planning instruments, also considered management instruments, are mandatory as they are fundamental for the most effective, productive, and rational management of water, the conservation of natural resources, and the environment. This planning must specify the national, regional, and local objectives of the National Water Resources Policy, the priorities for the use and exploitation of national waters, as well as the conservation of their quantity and quality, the parties responsible for their execution, and the origin and destination of the required resources. Art. 16 The formulation and integration of water planning shall additionally take into account the necessary criteria to guarantee the sustainable beneficial use and the integrated exploitation of the water resources of hydrographic watersheds and aquifers as management units. Art. 17 Water planning implies the development of a National Water Resources Plan by the national water authority, which will serve as the basis for the development of plans and programs by watershed, under the responsibility of the Basin Organizations. These plans will be approved by the National Water Resources Council (CNRH). The approved plans and programs will be an integral part of the water planning process. The National Water Resources Council (CNRH) will periodically evaluate the progress in the implementation of the National Plan and the plans and programs by watershed. Art. 18 The National Water Resources Plan and the plans and programs by watershed shall be published in La Gaceta, Official Journal, without 169 prejudice to the National Water Authority disseminating them widely and in their entirety through any national written social communication medium. These shall be reviewed and updated at least every three years. Chapter IV Declaration of Public Utility Art. 19 For the purposes of this Law, the Executive Branch, at the proposal of the National Water Authority, after consultation with the Regional Councils of the Autonomous Regions of the Atlantic Coast and the Municipal Councils, may declare of public utility: a) The acquisition or use of lands, real property, and communication routes required for the construction, operation, maintenance, conservation, rehabilitation, improvement, or development of public hydraulic works and their respective services; b) The comprehensive protection of the catchment areas of supply sources, prioritizing soil conservation and forest resources, which must be subject to reforestation programs; and c) The installation, modernization, and technification of irrigation or drainage districts and other areas under irrigation in order to optimize and permit the integrated management of water and land. Art. 20 The effects that may arise from the provisions of this chapter are subject to the terms indicated in the Law of Expropriation, Law No. 229, published in La Gaceta, Official Journal No. 58, of March 9, 1976.
