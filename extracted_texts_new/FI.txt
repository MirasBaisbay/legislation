General Provisions

Purpose of the Act

The purpose of this Act is to:

promote, organize, and coordinate the use of water resources and the water environment so that their use is socially, economically, and ecologically sustainable,

prevent and reduce nuisances caused by water or by the use of the water environment, and

improve the state of water resources and the water environment.

Scope of the Act and Relation to Other Legislation

This Act applies to water management matters. The Environmental Protection Act (527/2014) shall apply to water management matters that entail a risk of pollution of a water body and do not require a permit under this Act. (27.6.2014/531)

When this Act is applied, and also otherwise in proceedings under this Act, the Nature Conservation Act (9/2023), the Antiquities Act (295/1963), the Land Use and Building Act (132/1999), and the Building Act (751/2023) shall be observed. (21.4.2023/774)

Subsection 2 has been amended by Act 774/2023, which enters into force on 1 January 2025. The previous form reads:
When this Act is applied, and also otherwise in proceedings under this Act, the Nature Conservation Act (9/2023), the Antiquities Act (295/1963), and the Land Use and Building Act (132/1999) shall be observed. (5.1.2023/34)

Provisions on the prevention of environmental pollution are found in the Environmental Protection Act, provisions on water services in the Water Services Act (119/2001), provisions on dam safety in the Dam Safety Act (494/2009), provisions on the prevention of sanitary nuisances in the Health Protection Act (763/1994), and provisions on water resources management in the Act on the Organisation of Water Resources and Marine Management (1299/2004).

Definitions

In this Act, the following definitions apply:

water management matter means the implementation of a water management project and other use and care of water resources and the water environment,

water area means an area that is not only temporarily covered by water and is delimited as provided in § 5,

water body means lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and other natural water areas, as well as artificial lakes, canals, and other corresponding artificial water areas, but not rivulets, ditches, or springs,

river means a flowing water body with a catchment area of at least one hundred square kilometers,

stream means a flowing water body that is smaller than a river,

rivulet means a channel smaller than a stream, with a catchment area of less than ten square kilometers, where water does not flow constantly and fish cannot migrate to a significant extent,

groundwater means water found in the soil or bedrock,

groundwater body means groundwater stored as a cohesive body of water in the saturated zone,

water management project means a project where a measure is carried out or a structure is used in a water or land area in a way that can affect surface water or groundwater, the water environment, or water management, or the use of a water area,

project proponent means the applicant, permit holder, or any other person who, in a water management project, is responsible for the preparation, implementation, operation, or maintenance, or for carrying on the activity,

hydropower means the power calculated for a specific part of a water body based on the mean water flow and the corresponding head,

hydropower plant means a facility built for the utilization of hydropower in a water body, and the structures belonging to the facility,

public fairway means a fairway in a water body that has been established as a public fairway or a public local fairway in accordance with this Act,

private fairway means a fairway in a water body other than one referred to in point 13 and § 6,

area taken into special use means a plot, building site, garden, storage area or beach, a port area, or any other corresponding land or water area,

water services plant means a facility that manages a community's water services and is referred to in the Water Services Act, and

dredged material means soil substances and sludge removed from the bottom of a water area.

What is prescribed in this Act about fish and fishing also applies to lampreys and crayfish and their capture.

Territorial Waters and Economic Zone

What is prescribed in this Act about water bodies shall also apply to Finland's territorial waters and economic zone.

Boundary of a Water Area

For the application of this Act, the shoreline at the mean water level is considered the boundary of a water area towards land.

If the water level or the relative position of the water and land areas changes or has changed, the boundary of the water area is determined according to the water levels after the change.

The boundary between the sea and land areas is the boundary of Finland's territorial waters on the landward side as referred to in § 3 of the Act on the Limits of the Territorial Waters of Finland (463/1956).

King's Vein

At the deepest point in a river, there is a channel for the free flow of water, navigation, timber floating, and fish migration (king's vein). What is prescribed in this Act about the king's vein also applies to such straits or narrower channels in a water body where traffic is regularly conducted or where fish commonly migrate.

The king's vein is one-third of the river's width at the mean water level. If traffic or floating is regularly conducted in the water body, the king's vein is, however, at least seven meters wide.

The permit authority may, upon application, establish the width and location of the king's vein. If important reasons so require, it may be decided that the king's vein shall be wider or narrower or that it shall be located elsewhere than what is stated in subsections 1 and 2.

Authorities

The Regional State Administrative Agency is the permit authority referred to in this Act. Chapter 5 prescribes the competence of the municipal environmental protection authority and the drainage proceeding in drainage matters.

The Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (state supervisory authority) and the municipal environmental protection authority are the supervisory authorities referred to in this Act.

In this Act, fisheries authority means the area of responsibility within the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment that handles fisheries issues.

Chapter 2
General Rights, Obligations, and Restrictions

Ownership of and Control over Water

The water in a water cistern, well, or other water intake is owned by the person who owns the cistern, well, or water intake. The water in a spring or artificial pond is owned by the person who owns the land. Other open water and groundwater are controlled by the owner of the water or land area, with the restrictions prescribed in this Act and unless otherwise follows from the right of another.

When a river or stream belongs in equal parts to two separate properties or to two areas that are jointly owned by the properties, the owner of each side has the right to control an equal share of the flowing water.

Certain Rights and Obligations

The rights and obligations under this Act that are associated with a water or land area belong to the owner of the area, unless otherwise prescribed below or specifically.

Provisions on the right of partners in a joint property unit to make use of the joint property unit are laid down in the Act on Jointly Owned Areas (758/1989).

Moving in a Water Body

Unless otherwise prescribed by law, everyone has the right, without causing unnecessary damage, nuisance, or disturbance, to:

travel in a water body and on ice over a water body,

temporarily anchor in a water body,

float timber in a water body,

swim in a water body, and

temporarily move such fishing gear and other loose objects in a king's vein or public fairway that are an impediment to navigation or timber floating, and such loose objects outside the channel that cause unreasonable impediment to navigation or hinder timber floating.

What is prescribed in subsection 1 about water bodies also applies to an area outside the boundaries of a water area as referred to in Chapter 1, § 5, when the area is covered by water.

Abstraction of Water

Everyone has the right to take water and ice for personal use, other than permanently, from a water body or from an area outside the boundaries of a water area as referred to in Chapter 1, § 5, when the area is covered by water. Everyone also has the right to sporadically take water or ice in small quantities from a rivulet belonging to another or from a spring that is not in permanent use by the owner or with the owner's permission by another person. Chapter 4 prescribes other abstractions of water.

Water or ice may not be taken under subsection 1 in such a way that the owner of the area or other right holders are caused nuisance or other than minor disturbance.

Placement of a Structure in Another's Water Area

The owner or possessor of a shore has the right, for their own private needs, to place a mooring post or mooring buoy for a boat, or build a jetty, a boathouse, or another comparable structure in front of the shore in the water body, extending over a water area that the owner or possessor of the shore does not own or have a share in. This right requires that the construction or use of the structure does not require a permit under Chapter 3, § 2 or 3, and that it can be done without causing damage or significant nuisance to the owner of the water area. Such a right does not, however, exist in a water area that has been taken into special use.

(12.4.2019/505)
Placement of a Pipeline in Another's Water Area

The project proponent has the right to place a water, sewer, or power line, or a telecommunications cable, or any other pipeline with a corresponding effect that runs under a king's vein or a stream, also in another's water area, if:

the placement of the pipeline does not require a permit under Chapter 3, § 2,

the placement of the pipeline is not regulated in the Environmental Protection Act,

the placement of the pipeline does not cause other than minor nuisance to the owner of the area.

The project proponent shall notify the owner of the water area of a measure referred to in subsection 1 at least 60 days before the measure is carried out. Notwithstanding what is prescribed in § 26 of the Act on Jointly Owned Areas, an unincorporated partnership for a joint property unit may be notified of the measure by publishing information about the notification on the state supervisory authority's website, in compliance with § 62 of the Administrative Procedure Act (434/2003). Information about the notification shall also be published on the website of the municipality in whose area the pipeline is placed, in compliance with § 108 of the Local Government Act (410/2015). Provisions on the obligation to submit a notification to the state supervisory authority are in § 15 of this chapter.

Removal of Nuisance and Placement of Dredged Material

If siltation, a shoal, or a similar nuisance in the use of a water body is an impediment to someone, they may, without the consent of the owner of the water area, take measures necessary to remove the nuisance and which are intended to improve the state of the water body and the possibilities of using it. This right requires that the measures do not require a permit under Chapter 3, § 2 or 3, and that the work does not cause significant nuisance to the owner or such environmental pollution in the water area as is referred to in § 5, subsection 1, point 2 of the Environmental Protection Act. The same applies to the placement of dredged material in another's water area. (27.6.2014/531)

The placement of dredged material on another's land area requires the landowner's consent. The permit authority may, however, grant the right to place dredged material if the placement does not cause significant nuisance to the use of the area and if an environmental permit under the Environmental Protection Act is not required for the placement.

At least 30 days before a measure referred to in subsection 1 is carried out, the owner of the water area shall be notified of the measure and how the work will be performed. Notwithstanding what is prescribed in § 26 of the Act on Jointly Owned Areas, an unincorporated partnership for a joint property unit may be notified of the measure and how the work will be performed by publishing information about the notification on the state supervisory authority's website, in compliance with § 62 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Information about the notification shall also be published on the website of the municipality in whose area the project is carried out or to which its effects extend, in compliance with § 108 of the Local Government Act. Provisions on the obligation to submit a notification to the state supervisory authority are in § 15 of this chapter. (12.4.2019/505)

General Obligations regarding the Use of Water Resources and Water Areas

Water management projects shall be carried out and water resources and water areas shall otherwise be used in such a way that public or private interests are not infringed in a manner that can be avoided, if the purpose of the project or use can be achieved without an unreasonable increase in costs in relation to the total costs and the damage caused.

Sámi Rights

A water management project carried out within the Sámi Homeland or whose effects extend to it may not, to more than a minor extent, impair the opportunities of the Sámi as an indigenous people to exercise their rights to maintain and develop their culture and to practice their traditional livelihoods.

Maintenance and Removal of Structures

Anyone who owns a structure in a water body shall keep the structure in such a condition that it does not cause danger or harmful or detrimental effects that infringe on public or private interests.

Structures that affect the water level or the course of the water may not be removed without a permit from the permit authority. A prerequisite for a permit to be granted is that public or private interests are not significantly infringed if the structure is removed.

A decision to remove a structure shall be accompanied by the conditions necessary to safeguard public or private interests. Such loss of benefit that is due to the removal of the structure shall be compensated. A person who has not shared in the costs of the project does not, however, have the right to compensation for the loss of benefit that the structure has provided.

Altering the Course of Water in Rivulets and Ditches

The owner of a rivulet, a ditch, or a stream may not alter the free course of the water in the channel to the detriment of someone downstream without their consent. No consent is needed if the owner of the channel or stream has a need for use that requires the project to be carried out. If someone downstream takes water from the channel for household consumption on their property, those upstream may not, however, use the water for any other purpose to such an extent that it prevents access to water for household consumption on the property downstream. Chapter 5 prescribes drainage and measures related to drainage.

Protection of Certain Types of Water Environments

It is prohibited to endanger the natural conditions in lagoons or gloe lakes of at most ten hectares, or springs, or, elsewhere than in the province of Lapland, in ponds or lakes of at most one hectare, or in rivulets.

The permit authority may, in individual cases upon application, grant an exemption from the prohibition in subsection 1, if the objectives for the protection of the types of water environments mentioned in the subsection are not significantly endangered. If a project for which a permit under this Act has been sought has such consequences as are referred to in subsection 1, the question of granting an exemption shall be examined ex officio in connection with the permit matter. In the case of an exemption, what is prescribed about permits granted by the permit authority applies in applicable parts.

(8.9.2017/611)
Minor Right of Use to Another's Area

If the conditions under Chapter 3, § 4, subsection 1 are met, the applicant may be granted the right to:

erect a minor structure in water with constructions that reach land or place a device or a pipeline in another's area or a joint property unit in a water body without significantly altering the water body,

temporarily dam up water in another's area,

carry out clearing work in another's area,

straighten or widen a channel to a minor extent in another's area, or

deposit soil to be removed on another's land or water area, but not in an area that has been taken into special use.

(8.9.2017/611)
Right of Use to Another's Area or Building

The applicant may be granted a right of use to an area belonging to another and to the buildings or other structures on the area, if the implementation of a water management project means that the area is needed:

for a device, building, or other structure and for its use and maintenance,

as the bed for a new water area as referred to in Chapter 1, § 5, subsection 2, or as the bed for a new channel,

for the depositing of soil that is removed, or

for a device or structure needed to protect a public or private interest and for its use and maintenance.

A right of use to another's area or structure may be granted if:

the condition specified in Chapter 3, § 4, subsection 1, point 2 for a water management project is met, and

the applicant, based on ownership or a permanent right of use, possesses at least half of the required area or, if the area belongs to the applicant and others jointly, the area subject to the measure is not significantly larger than the area corresponding to the applicant's share in the joint property unit.

A right of use may not, however, be granted if:

the right concerns an area that is larger than minor and the right causes significant nuisance regarding the possibilities for the owner of the area to utilize the area to which the right pertains, or

the right concerns an area of minor extent and prevents the owner of the area from utilizing the area to which the right pertains and this causes significant nuisance regarding the owner's possibilities to utilize their other areas or their other property.

(8.9.2017/611)
Projects Required by a Public Need

An applicant may, for the implementation of a project that promotes a significant public interest, be granted the necessary right to another's area or to the redemption of another's area, if the conditions for granting a permit are met and the project can be considered required by a public need. Such a need may relate to:

securing the energy supply or water services, telecommunications, or transport connections,

promoting public recreation or nature conservation,

preparedness for extreme weather and water conditions or control of water management in a catchment area, or

any other significant public interest that can be equated with what is stated in points 1–3.

(8.9.2017/611)
Right to Another's Structure

If the implementation of a water management project is hindered by a building, facility, or other structure belonging to another and its removal is not included in a right granted under § 13 or 13 a, the permit authority may, under the conditions stated in those paragraphs, grant the applicant the right to remove, alter, or use the structure.

In a decision by which the applicant is granted the right to remove or alter a structure belonging to another, the owner of the structure shall, if they so demand, be given the opportunity to remove or alter the structure themselves within a certain time. The applicant shall then compensate the owner for the reasonable costs that the measure causes.

If the owner wishes to remove a structure that another has been granted a permit to use and which the user still needs, the permit authority may, upon application, grant the user the right to redeem the structure. The redemption price shall be determined according to the structure's current value, taking into account what has already been paid to the owner for the construction costs and the nuisance caused by the structure remaining on another's property.

(8.9.2017/611)
Granting of a Right

The right to another's area or structure is granted as a permanent right or, for special reasons, for a fixed term. An area may only be used for the purpose for which this right has been granted.

Matters concerning the granting of a right to another's area or structure are decided by the permit authority in connection with the permit matter or upon a separate application. Provisions on compensation for the loss of benefit as a result of such a right being granted are in Chapter 13.

(8.9.2017/611)
Duty to Notify

The project proponent shall submit a written notification to the state supervisory authority regarding:

a measure referred to in § 5 a and § 6, subsection 1,

the extraction of soil substances from the bottom of a water body, if the measure does not require a permit under Chapter 3, § 2 or 3,

the abstraction of surface water or groundwater, if the amount taken exceeds 100 cubic meters per day and a permit under Chapter 3, § 2 or 3 is not required for the abstraction.

A notification shall be made at least 30 days before a measure is initiated. In the case of a project as referred to in § 5 a, the notification shall, however, be made at least 60 days before the measure is initiated. If the project proponent is not a natural person, the notification shall be made electronically. The supervisory authority may, for special reasons, approve that the notification be submitted on paper. (12.4.2019/505)

The notification shall include information about the project, how it is implemented, and its environmental consequences. If the notification concerns an activity as referred to in § 6, subsection 1, it shall also include information about other corresponding projects planned within the project's area of influence and of which the project proponent is aware.

More detailed provisions on how the notification shall be made and what information it shall contain may be issued by Government decree.

(8.9.2017/611)
Requirements concerning the Placement of a Pipeline

In order to prevent the placement of a pipeline referred to in § 5 a from causing nuisance, more detailed provisions shall be issued by Government decree on:

the elevation and distance of the constructions and devices in relation to objects that may be adversely affected,

requirements to be placed on the constructions and devices in order to prevent nuisance to the environment,

the manner of implementing the project,

the time of the construction work,

how the construction is marked in the terrain,

the content of the notification about the project made to the authorities,

other such requirements on the implementation of the project that can be equated with the requirements in points 1–6.

Chapter 3
Water Management Projects Subject to a Permit

Scope

This chapter applies to all water management projects, unless otherwise specifically prescribed.

General Permit Requirement for Water Management Projects

A permit from the permit authority is required for a water management project if the project may alter the location, depth, water level, water flow, shore, or water environment of a water body or the quality or quantity of groundwater, and if the change:

entails a risk of flooding or a general water shortage,

causes a harmful change in nature and its function or deteriorates the state of a water body or a groundwater body,

significantly reduces the natural beauty, amenity, or cultural values of the surroundings or the suitability of the water body for recreational purposes,

poses a danger to health,

leads to a significant reduction in the abundance of an important or other suitable groundwater body for water supply, or impairs the possibilities of using it, or in some other way causes damage or nuisance to the abstraction of water or the use of water as household water,

causes damage or nuisance to fishing or the fish stock,

causes damage or nuisance to water traffic or timber floating,

endangers the preservation of the natural conditions in a stream channel, or

in some other comparable way infringes a public interest.

A water management project also requires a permit from the permit authority if a change as referred to in subsection 1 causes a loss of benefit to another's water area, fishing, water supply, land, property, or other property. A permit is not needed, however, if the loss of benefit only concerns a private benefit and the holder of it has given written consent to the project.

A permit from the permit authority is also needed for:

altering rivulets or ditches or the course of water in them in a way that causes damage to another's land, when the landowner has not given their consent to such changes and it is not a matter of drainage as referred to in Chapter 5,

using a structure to be erected in a water area, when the use of the structure disturbs the use of another's property and the owner of the property has not given their consent to such use.

A permit is also needed for amending a water management project for which a permit has been granted, if the amendment infringes public or private interests in a manner referred to in subsections 1–3.

Water Management Projects That Always Require a Permit

Regardless of the consequences referred to in § 2, a permit from the permit authority is always required for the following water management projects:

closing or restricting a king's vein or a public fairway or timber floating channel, or placing a device or any other obstacle that impedes the use of a channel,

abstracting water for the needs of a water services plant or for the needs of another, if the latter supplies water to a water services plant, or for conveyance for use elsewhere, as well as other abstraction of groundwater when it exceeds 250 cubic meters per day, and other measures that cause the groundwater body to decrease by at least 250 cubic meters of groundwater per day, other than temporarily,

infiltration of water into the ground for artificial groundwater formation or improvement of groundwater quality,

construction of a bridge or transport device over a public fairway or king's vein,

construction of a water, sewer, or power line or any other pipeline under a public fairway,

permanent change of a land area to a water area by raising the water level in a water body,

construction of a hydropower plant,

dredging of a water area, if the amount of dredged material exceeds 500 cubic meters and it is not a matter of maintaining a public fairway,

placement of dredged material in Finland's territorial waters for disposal purposes, if the amount is not so small that it is insignificant,

extraction of soil substances from the bottom of a water area for other than ordinary household use,

establishment of a permanent place of business for floating.

(8.9.2017/611)
A permit is also needed for altering a facility or structure for which a permit under subsection 1 has been granted and for altering the use of the facility or structure, if the alteration infringes public or private interests.

General Conditions for a Permit

A permit shall be granted for a water management project if the project:

does not significantly infringe public or private interests, or

brings such benefits to public or private interests that are considerable in relation to the losses it causes to such interests.

A permit may not, however, be granted if the water management project endangers public health or public safety, causes considerable harmful changes in the natural conditions of the surroundings or in the water environment and its function, or significantly deteriorates the residential or economic conditions in the locality.

The applicant must have the right to the areas required for the project. If the applicant does not own an area and does not possess it with the support of a permanent right of use, a prerequisite for a permit is that the applicant, in accordance with Chapter 2, is granted the right to use the area or presents a reliable account of how the right to the area will be arranged.

Relationship to Land Use Planning

When permit matters are decided, the detailed plan shall be taken into account. In addition, what is prescribed in the Land Use and Building Act regarding the legal effects of regional plans and master plans shall be taken into account. (21.4.2023/774)

Subsection 1 has been amended by Act 774/2023, which enters into force on 1 January 2025. The previous form reads:
When permit matters are decided, the detailed plan shall be taken into account. In addition, the provisions of the Land Use and Building Act regarding the legal effects of regional plans and master plans shall be taken into account.

When a permit matter is decided, it must be ensured that the permit does not to any significant degree impede the drawing up of plans.

Assessment of Public Benefit or Loss

When the conditions for granting a permit are assessed, the benefit or loss that the water management project causes with regard to public interests shall be assessed from a public point of view. If the extent of the benefit or loss can be measured in money, the monetary value may be used in the assessment.

In the assessment, consideration shall be given to the circumstances concerning the water status and water use within the project's area of influence according to the management plan and the marine management plan referred to in the Act on the Organisation of Water Resources and Marine Management. In the assessment, consideration shall also be given to what has been stated in the flood risk management plan referred to in the Act on Flood Risk Management (620/2010) about the flood risks and the objectives for managing the flood risks within the project's area of influence, as well as the measures aimed at achieving the objectives. (30.12.2013/1193)

Assessment of Private Benefit or Loss

When the conditions for granting a permit for a water management project are assessed, the increase in the use value of the property that follows from the improvement of the yield or usability of the land or water area or other property is considered as a private benefit of the project. The same applies to other benefits that can be immediately gained by implementing the project.

As a private loss due to the project is considered:

the rights of use or redemption granted to the applicant,

the costs for such damages and rights of use that the applicant has specifically agreed on with the person concerned in order to be able to implement the project, and the acquisition costs for such areas that have been voluntarily transferred to the applicant for a corresponding reason, and

other losses caused to those who are not participants in the project and, in this Act, intended passive partners in drainage.

Permit Validity Period

A permit is granted indefinitely or, for special reasons, for a fixed term.

In a permit that is valid indefinitely, it shall be stated within which time the water management project shall be implemented and initiated. The time for implementing the project may be at most ten years and the time within which it must be initiated at most four years.

For special reasons, the permit authority may extend the time prescribed in subsection 2 if the application is made before the end of that time. In the extension decision, the conditions in the permit may be reviewed or supplemented.

When a Permit Ceases to be Valid

A permit that has been granted for a fixed term ceases to be valid when the time expires, unless otherwise prescribed in the permit decision.

A permit that is valid indefinitely ceases to be valid if the measures required in the permit decision have not been substantially carried out or initiated within the time specified in the permit decision or within the extended time as referred to in § 8, subsection 3.

The rights of use to another's property that have been granted in a permit decision cease to be valid when a permit that is valid indefinitely ceases to be valid. The same applies to redemption, unless the ownership right has already been transferred to the permit holder.

General Permit Conditions

A permit decision shall be accompanied by the necessary conditions regarding:

the avoidance, in accordance with Chapter 2, §§ 7 and 8, of nuisances caused by the project or its implementation,

the restoration of the landscape and the removal of traces of the work otherwise, and

such measures and devices that are needed to preserve the conditions in the water body and the groundwater body.

If the project affects the water level or the course of the water in the water body, the permit decision shall also, where necessary, include conditions concerning the maximum or minimum level of the water and the regulation of the water flow.

If a project that is subject to a permit under this Act causes environmental pollution in a water area as referred to in § 5 of the Environmental Protection Act, or a risk of such pollution, the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act on the issuance of permit conditions shall also be applied when the permit conditions are issued. (27.6.2014/531)

When a permit is granted, the exercise of the right granted by the permit may be limited to a specific purpose.

Monitoring Obligation

In the permit, the permit holder shall, where necessary, be obliged to monitor how the project is implemented and what its consequences are. The permit authority or, by its order, the state supervisory authority or the fisheries authority may oblige several permit holders to jointly monitor the consequences of their activities (coordinated recipient monitoring) or to approve participation in monitoring within the area for the monitoring of the activity. The coordinated recipient monitoring may also apply to monitoring based on the Environmental Protection Act and this Act. In a decision on monitoring, a permit holder may be granted the right to carry out monitoring and place devices and structures required by the monitoring on another's area. Provisions on compensation for the loss of benefit as a result of the monitoring are in Chapter 13. (8.9.2017/611)

In the permit, the permit holder may be obliged to submit for approval to the permit authority or a authority appointed by it a monitoring plan for a more detailed organization of the monitoring referred to in subsection 1 in such good time that the monitoring can be initiated at the same time as the activity is initiated or at some other time that is appropriate with regard to the consequences of the activity.

The authority that has made a decision on coordinated recipient monitoring or on the approval of the monitoring plan may amend the decision even if the permit is in force. The matter may be initiated on the initiative of the authority or at the request of the permit holder, the supervisory authority, an authority that protects the public interest, the municipality, or a party who is caused nuisance. A decision on coordinated recipient monitoring shall always be amended if a new permit holder has been obliged to participate in the coordinated recipient monitoring.

What has been considered necessary for monitoring under the monitoring programme for the status of waters as referred to in the Act on the Organisation of Water Resources and Marine Management shall be taken into account when someone is imposed a monitoring obligation. The data from the monitoring of the project can be used in the monitoring and preparation of the management plan according to the Act on the Organisation of Water Resources and Marine Management.

(12.4.2019/505)
Imposing a Monitoring Obligation

A decision on coordinated recipient monitoring and a decision on the approval of the monitoring plan, as well as a decision on amending such a decision, shall be made in compliance with the applicable parts of the Administrative Procedure Act, unless the decision is made in connection with the permit being granted or amended. The decision is served and information about the decision is given in compliance with Chapter 11, § 22. Provisions on a request for a review of the decision are in Chapter 15, § 1, subsection 3.

Connections

If a project affects a king's vein or a public fairway, it shall be stated in the permit decision that the project shall be implemented in such a way that traffic can still be conducted in the water body without significant nuisance.

If the project is carried out in a water body that is of importance for floating, the project proponent shall be obliged in the permit decision to install the devices or structures needed to ensure that timber can be transported, and to protect the project structures from floating damage.

If the project leads to a connection that serves public or private use being interrupted or significantly impaired in a water area or on its ice or shore, the project proponent shall be obliged in the permit decision to build a road, pay the costs for building a road, or take other measures to arrange a connection that meets reasonable requirements for those who need the connection.

Fishery Conservation Obligation and Fishery Management Fee

If a water management project causes damage to the fish stock or to fishing, the project proponent shall be obliged to take measures to prevent or reduce the damage (fishery conservation obligation) or to pay the fisheries authority a fee corresponding to the reasonable costs of these measures (fishery management fee).

When a fishery conservation obligation, a fishery management fee, or a combination of them is imposed, the nature and effects of the project, other conservation measures to be taken in the area affected by the harmful effects of the project, and the regulation of fishing shall be taken into account. The measures included in the fishery conservation obligation may not cause such costs for the project proponent that are unreasonable in relation to the benefit that can be gained from them.

The fishery conservation obligation may consist of a fishway, a restoration measure concerning the fishing industry, fish stocking, or some other conservation measure concerning the fishing industry, or a combination of these measures. Where necessary, the fishery conservation obligation may include monitoring of the results of the measures in the water area affected by the harmful effects of the project.

The fishery management fee shall be used for planning and implementing measures according to subsection 1 and for monitoring their results in the water area where the project has harmful effects. The permit authority may issue instructions to the fisheries authority on how the fee is to be used.

Plan for Fulfilling the Fishery Conservation Obligation and Plan for Using the Fishery Management Fee

The project proponent shall draw up a detailed plan for how the fishery conservation obligation specified in the permit is to be fulfilled (plan for fulfilling the fishery conservation obligation). The fisheries authority shall approve the plan. No plan needs to be drawn up, however, if the fishery conservation obligation is minor and its content is specified in detail in the permit.

The fisheries authority shall establish a plan that specifies the measures to be financed with the fishery management fee (plan for using the fishery management fee). If several fishery management fees have been imposed for preventing nuisances in the same water area, a joint plan for the use of the fees may be drawn up.

A decision on the approval of a plan for fulfilling the fishery conservation obligation and the establishment of a plan for using the fishery management fee shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. The decision is served and information about the decision is given in compliance with what is prescribed in Chapter 11, § 22 about notification of and information about a decision on an application matter. Provisions on a request for a review of the decision are in Chapter 15, § 1, subsection 3. The decision may be amended ex officio or at the request of the project proponent, the supervisory authority, an authority that protects the public interest in the matter, the municipality, or a party who is caused nuisance. (12.4.2019/505)

Permit for Preparatory Work

For a justified reason, the permit authority may in its permit decision grant the applicant the right to take preparatory measures for the implementation of the project already before the decision has gained legal force (permit for preparatory work). The measures shall be specified as necessary in the permit decision. Another's area may be used for the above-mentioned measures only if such a right is established in the permit or if the right holders otherwise consent to it.

A permit for preparatory work may be granted if:

the preparatory measures can be taken without causing any significant nuisance to the other use of the waters or to nature and its function, and

the conditions after the measures have been taken can be substantially restored in the event that the permit decision is repealed or the permit conditions are amended.

A permit for preparatory work may, under the same conditions, be granted on a separate application made during the appeal period or within 14 days after the end of the appeal period. The supervisory authorities and those who have appealed a permit decision shall be heard on the application. Thereafter, a decision shall be made without delay. The administrative court and those who have appealed shall be immediately notified that a permit for preparatory work has been granted. A person who has appealed a decision made in the main case may, at the administrative court, demand the repeal or amendment of a decision concerning a permit for preparatory work without having to state special grounds for appeal.

Decision on a Permit for Preparatory Work

In a decision on a permit for preparatory work, applicants other than the state or a municipality or a joint municipal authority shall be obliged to provide an acceptable security before measures are taken, unless this is clearly unnecessary. The security shall cover compensation for the damages, nuisances, and costs that may arise if the decision is repealed or the permit conditions are amended. When security is released, Chapter 11, § 20 shall apply.

The permit authority shall decide that the compensation determined in the permit decision or a part of it shall be paid before the measures to which the permit for preparatory work pertains are initiated. The compensation may be collected against an acceptable security. A decision by the permit authority as referred to in this subsection may not be appealed.

A decision concerning a permit for preparatory work may be enforced even if it is appealed. The appellate court may order that the measures be interrupted or limited. An appeal concerning a permit for preparatory work shall be handled expeditiously.

Notification of Completion

The project proponent shall submit a notification to the permit authority and the state supervisory authority that a water management project has been completed or that a structure belonging to the project has been taken into use (notification of completion).

Discontinuation of a Project

A project aimed at changing the mean water level or regulating a water body shall be completed if measures have been taken to implement the project.

The permit authority may, upon application, grant a permit to discontinue a project as referred to in subsection 1. A prerequisite for a permit to be granted is that public or private interests are not significantly infringed if the project is discontinued.

In the decision to discontinue a project, the project proponent shall be obliged to take the necessary measures to prevent damages and nuisances from arising as a result of the project being discontinued and to pay compensation for the damages that the discontinuation causes.

Review of Permit Conditions within a Certain Time

In a decision on a permit that is valid indefinitely, it may be stated that the permit conditions concerning the water environment and its use in a project shall be reviewed within a certain time, if this is necessary to avoid the project causing significant nuisances.

In such a case, the permit decision shall state when the permit holder shall at the latest bring the matter of updating specified permit conditions to the permit authority for review and what reports shall then be submitted.

The permit authority shall handle the matter in applicable parts as a permit application. If the permit holder has not made an application within the set time, the permit authority may, upon application by the state supervisory authority or by someone who suffers damage or nuisance, decide that the permit shall cease to be valid and in connection with this issue necessary provisions.

(30.12.2013/1193)
Other Review of Permit Conditions and Issuance of New Conditions

The permit authority may, upon application, review the permit conditions and issue new conditions, if:

the implementation of the project in accordance with the permit conditions has harmful effects that were not foreseen when the permit conditions were issued and that cannot otherwise be reduced to a sufficient extent,

the implementation of the project in accordance with the permit conditions, as a result of changed circumstances, has harmful effects that cannot otherwise be reduced to a sufficient extent,

it is required for safety reasons, or

flooding or drought may cause a general danger to human life, safety, or health, great damage to public interests, or great and extensive damage to private interests, and these effects cannot otherwise be reduced to a sufficient extent.

Unless otherwise determined in the permit decision, an application for the permit conditions to be reviewed or new conditions to be issued on the basis of subsection 1, point 1, shall be made within ten years from the date a notification of completion under § 18 has been made.

The review of the permit conditions or the issuance of new conditions on the basis of subsection 1, points 2–4, may not to any significant extent reduce the benefit of the project. The applicant shall, in compliance with the applicable parts of Chapter 13, be obliged to compensate for other than minor loss of benefit that the review or the new conditions cause. If the permit conditions are reviewed or new conditions are issued on the basis of subsection 1, point 4, what is determined in Chapter 18, § 6, subsection 1 shall also be applied to compensation for the loss of benefit that this causes.

An application for the permit conditions to be reviewed or new conditions to be issued on the basis of subsection 1, points 1–3, may be made by a holder of a private benefit who is affected by harmful effects, by the municipality, by the supervisory authority, or by the authority that protects a public interest in the matter. An application on the basis of subsection 1, point 4, may be made by the state supervisory authority, taking into account what is prescribed in Chapter 18, § 3 a. The permit authority shall handle the matter in applicable parts as a permit application.

Review of Conditions concerning Fishery Conservation Obligation or Fishery Management Fee

The permit authority may, upon application, amend conditions concerning a fishery conservation obligation or a fishery management fee if the circumstances have changed significantly. An obligation that has proven to be inappropriate for the fishing industry may also be reviewed if the result, with regard to this industry, can be improved without the costs for fulfilling the obligation increasing significantly.

If a person has been charged an annual fishery management fee and the cost level on which the fee was based has changed, the fisheries authority shall collect the fee adjusted according to the increased cost level. The adjustment is made in whole tens of percent and otherwise according to the principles stated by the permit authority.

In case of disagreement about the adjustment of the fee, the matter may be referred to the permit authority by application. The fisheries authority shall without delay refund the part of the fishery management fee that exceeds the fee later imposed by a decision of the permit authority.

Amendment of Permit Conditions on Application by the Permit Holder

If, during the implementation of a water management project, it proves appropriate to amend the permit conditions, the permit authority may amend the conditions on application by the permit holder. This requires that the amendment is of minor significance and does not significantly infringe on the rights or interests of any other party. The permit authority shall, in applicable parts, handle the matter as a permit application.

Application for a Permit to Cease to be Valid

The permit authority may, upon application, decide that a permit shall cease to be valid, if:

the permit holder no longer exists or it cannot be ascertained without difficulty who the permit holder is,

the project has lost its original significance, or

the permit holder so requests.

In cases referred to in subsection 1, point 2, the permit holder shall, if they so demand, be given the opportunity to restore the structures included in the project or to take some other measure by which the benefit of the project that was the basis for granting the permit can be substantially restored. The permit holder shall be obliged to take the measure within a reasonable time under penalty of the permit otherwise ceasing to be valid and the obligations imposed under § 25 entering into force.

In cases referred to in subsection 1, points 1 and 2, what is prescribed in Chapter 14, § 14 regarding the right to initiate an application shall apply. With the consent of the permit holder, the applicant in cases referred to in subsection 1, point 3 may also be another party.

Decision for a Permit to Cease to be Valid

A decision for a permit to cease to be valid shall contain the necessary provisions for the removal of structures included in the project referred to in the permit, taking into account what is prescribed in Chapter 2, § 9, subsections 2 and 3, and in § 24, subsection 2 of this chapter. On orders for the removal of structures, Chapter 14, §§ 4, 5, and 8 shall also apply.

In cases referred to in § 24, subsection 1, point 1, the applicant may be granted in the decision a permit to preserve a structure or the right to redeem a structure without compensation. A corresponding permit to preserve a structure may also be granted in cases referred to in subsection 1, point 2, if the person who owns the structure has transferred it to the applicant.

In a decision for a permit to cease to be valid, it shall be stated that rights of use to another's property also cease to be valid. The same applies to redemption, if the ownership right has not already been transferred to the permit holder.

Chapter 4
Water Abstraction

Scope

This chapter applies to the abstraction of surface water and groundwater. In this chapter, abstraction of surface water means that water is taken from a water body or from a rivulet or a ditch.

In the case of abstraction of artificial groundwater, what is prescribed in this chapter about the abstraction of groundwater shall apply. When surface water is led into the ground for artificial groundwater formation, §§ 16, 17, and 28 of the Environmental Protection Act shall also be taken into account. (27.6.2014/531)

When water is taken from a water body for the needs of a community, what is prescribed in the Water Services Act and by virtue of it shall also apply.

Abstraction of Water from One's Own Area

Notwithstanding what is prescribed in Chapter 3, § 2, subsection 2, the owner or possessor of a water area may, without a permit from the permit authority, take surface water for ordinary use on their property.

If the water in a water body is not sufficient for all who need it for the purpose referred to in subsection 1, the municipal environmental protection authority may, upon application, by a decision, restrict the abstraction of water from the water area, taking into account the needs of those who use the water. The decision shall state whether the provisions apply indefinitely or for a fixed term. The provisions may be amended by a new decision if the circumstances change.

What is prescribed in subsection 1 also applies to the right of the owner or possessor of an area to take groundwater. A person who is a partner in a property or an area that is jointly owned has the right, with the restrictions prescribed in this Act, to take groundwater from this area in a way that does not cause nuisance or disturbances for other partners or prevent them from correspondingly using groundwater from the area.

(8.9.2017/611)
Abstraction of Surface Water from Another's Water Area

The owner or possessor of a property may take surface water from another's water area for ordinary use on their property and place a device or a pipeline required for the abstraction in the water area, provided that the abstraction does not have consequences as referred to in Chapter 3, § 2. In addition, it is required that the abstraction does not cause nuisance to those who take water from the same water area with a permit from the permit authority or based on ownership or possession of the water area.

The permit authority may, upon application, grant the right to other abstraction of surface water than what is referred to in subsection 1 and the right to place devices needed for that purpose in another's area.

Abstraction of Groundwater from Another's Area

The permit authority may, upon application, grant the right to take groundwater from another's area and to place devices needed for this purpose there, if the abstraction does not require a permit under Chapter 3, § 2 or 3.

The right to take groundwater may be granted for ordinary use on a property, for the arrangement of a community's water services or another public need, or for such industrial or economic activity for which it is particularly important to obtain groundwater. A prerequisite for the right to take groundwater to be granted is that the water still suffices for the needs of the owner or possessor of the area, those who are resident in the area, companies located there, and settlement that can be expected to arise there, and that the measure does not cause these unreasonable disturbances or nuisances.

The right to take water from another's well or water intake may be granted only with the owner's consent.

Reconciliation of the Needs to Take Water

When permit matters concerning the abstraction of water are decided, the needs to take water from a water body shall be reconciled.

If the water is not sufficient for all needs, the following order of precedence shall apply:

abstraction of water for ordinary use on a property in the vicinity of the abstraction site,

abstraction of water for the community's water services in the locality,

abstraction of water for industrial use in the locality or otherwise for use in the locality and abstraction of water for the community's water services outside the locality,

abstraction of water to be led or transported for use elsewhere for a purpose other than a community's water services.

Decision on Abstraction of Water

A decision concerning the abstraction of water shall state the purpose of the abstraction, the abstraction site, and the maximum abstraction.

In addition to the provisions on permit conditions in Chapter 3, the decision shall include necessary provisions on the placement of the water pipeline or the water intake, on the monitoring of how much water is taken, and on the measures that are permitted to secure water services in special situations within the water supply.

If the need to take water has ceased other than temporarily or has substantially decreased and another needs to be granted the right to take water from the same water body, the permit authority may review the provisions in the decision on the abstraction of water. The matter shall be handled in compliance with the applicable parts of what is prescribed in Chapter 11 on the application procedure.

Validity Period for a Permit to Take Water

In order to ensure that a community's water services are not disturbed, a permit to take water may be granted in whole or in part without a time limit as referred to in Chapter 3, § 8, subsection 2, within which the water abstraction must be initiated.

Placement of Water Pipelines and Devices

In a decision concerning the abstraction of water, a person may be granted the right to place a water pipeline in another's area if the pipeline serves the abstraction. A water pipeline shall be placed in another's area in such a way that it causes as little nuisance as possible. The area where the water pipeline is located may not be used in such a way that the pipeline may be damaged or its maintenance is made unreasonably difficult.

When it comes to placing water pipelines in cases other than in a decision on the abstraction of water, what is prescribed in § 132 of the Building Act shall apply. (21.4.2023/774)

Subsection 2 has been amended by Act 774/2023, which enters into force on 1 January 2025. The previous form reads:
When it comes to placing water pipelines in cases other than in a decision on the abstraction of water, what is prescribed in § 161 a of the Land Use and Building Act shall apply.

What is prescribed in this section about water pipelines also applies to minor devices and structures belonging to the pipelines, as well as such sewers and other pipelines for the abstraction of water or the discharge of wastewater that are placed in the same trench as the water pipeline at the same time.

Deviation from a Permit to Take Water

A person who has a permit to take water may, in special situations within the water supply, without a permit from the permit authority, temporarily supply water also for such use that is not referred to in the permit to take water, if this is necessary to ensure that a community's water services can function without disruption or for some other comparable compelling reason.

The state supervisory authority shall be notified of measures as referred to in subsection 1.

Limitation of Water Abstraction

If a prolonged drought or some other comparable cause leads to a significant reduction in the availability of water, the permit authority may, upon application, oblige the owner of a water intake to, for a certain period, limit the amount of water that may be taken from it in order to secure the supply of water for ordinary use on a property or the water services in a community.

If the limitation causes the owner of the water intake or the permit holder an unreasonable loss of benefit, the permit authority may, upon application, decide that the loss shall be compensated by the person who has applied for the limitation and by others who receive a significant benefit from it.

Protection Area for a Water Intake

The permit authority may, in a decision on the abstraction of water or by a separate order, direct that an area around a groundwater intake shall be a protection area. A protection area may be established if it is necessary to limit the use of the area to secure the water quality or the yield of the groundwater body. The protection area may not be made larger than necessary. A demand or application for a protection area to be established may be made by the project proponent, the supervisory authority, or a party.

Under the conditions stated in subsection 1, it may also be ordered that an area around a surface water intake shall be a protection area.

A decision to establish a protection area shall be observed even if it is appealed.

Protection Area Provisions

In a decision to establish a protection area, such provisions shall be issued on protective measures, other restrictions on the use of the protection area, and monitoring that the provisions are observed as are necessary to secure the supply of water (protection area provisions). The provisions may not be stricter than necessary. The owner or possessor of the water intake shall compensate for the loss of benefit that the provisions cause to another.

The permit authority may, upon application, grant an exemption from the protection area provisions in individual cases. Section 47, subsection 4 of the Environmental Protection Act prescribes the granting of an exemption in connection with environmental permit matters. (27.6.2014/531)

What is prescribed in Chapter 3, § 21 on the review of permit conditions applies in applicable parts to protection area provisions.

(8.9.2017/611)
Redemption Right in a Protection Area

The permit authority may, upon application, give the owner or possessor of a water intake that serves the arrangement of a community's water services or meets another public need the right to redeem an area that is located within a protection area, if the area is needed for devices or structures that serve the abstraction of water.

Chapter 5
Drainage

Scope

This chapter applies to drainage and to the use and maintenance of ditches. Drainage means that someone, with the intention of draining land or otherwise diverting water that hinders the use of an area:

constructs a ditch,

widens or straightens a ditch, a rivulet, or a stream, or

clears a rivulet or a stream that is not covered by Chapter 6.

This chapter also applies to the discharge of wastewater in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act.

Definitions

In this chapter, the following definitions apply:

drainage area means land for which joint drainage brings benefit,

benefit of drainage means the increase in the use value of the land for the purpose for which the land is used or for which it, taking the circumstances into account, can most closely be used,

beneficiary means the owner or owners of a property that benefits from the drainage,

joint drainage means drainage where the drainage area consists of properties belonging to different landowners,

active partner means a beneficiary who has demanded drainage or supported such a demand or who, with the aim of obtaining increased benefit, has demanded an amendment to a drainage plan, and

passive partner means a beneficiary who is not an active partner.

If water from the sewer network of a water services plant is discharged into a sewer of a water services plant whose purpose is to drain storm or drainage water, the area covered by the sewer network or a part of it shall be treated as a separate section of the drainage area. The water services plant is then considered a beneficiary.

Permit Requirement for Drainage

For drainage and for the use and maintenance of a ditch, a permit under this Act is required from the permit authority if the drainage, use, or maintenance may lead to:

pollution as referred to in § 5, subsection 1, point 2 of the Environmental Protection Act in a water area, or (27.6.2014/531)

consequences as referred to in Chapter 3, § 2, with the exception of altered water flow in a stream due to drainage that is only carried out in the area above the stream.

Need for a Drainage Proceeding

A drainage matter that, according to § 3, does not require a permit from the permit authority shall be handled at a drainage proceeding if:

the drainage leads to a floodplain disappearing or being reduced or to the drainage direction of the water being significantly changed,

point 2 has been repealed by Act 30.12.2013/1193. (30.12.2013/1193)

the ditch must be constructed under a public road, railway, cable, gas pipeline, water pipeline, heating pipeline, or a sewer, and the road keeper, railway keeper, or the owner of the cable, gas pipeline, water pipeline, heating pipeline, or sewer has not given their consent to the measure,

no agreement can be reached on joint drainage and there are at least three beneficiaries, or

it is a matter of amending a plan that has been decided earlier at a drainage proceeding or of forming or dissolving a drainage association or of the members' rights and obligations in the association.

What is prescribed in subsection 1, point 3 about constructing a new ditch also applies to the widening of an existing channel.

Competence of the Municipal Environmental Protection Authority in Drainage Matters

The municipal environmental protection authority handles such disputes in drainage matters that do not require a permit under § 3 or that are not to be handled at a drainage proceeding under § 4 and that are caused by:

the construction of a ditch on another's land or through another's private road,

a change in the course of a ditch,

the leading of water to a ditch or a stream on another's land, or

some other corresponding reason.

For the handling of matters concerning disputes, what is prescribed in Chapter 11 on the application procedure applies in applicable parts.

Notification of Drainage

The project proponent shall submit a notification to the state supervisory authority about any drainage other than insignificant drainage at least 60 days before the drainage begins. If the project proponent is not a natural person, the notification shall be made electronically. The supervisory authority may, for special reasons, approve that the notification be submitted on paper. A notification need not be made, however, if the drainage has been ordered in a decision under §§ 3–5, a road plan under the Act on the Transport System and Highways (503/2005), or a railway plan under the Railway Act (110/2007). The notification shall contain information about the project proponent and a description of the project, its environmental consequences, and its area of influence. More detailed provisions on the content of the notification may be issued by Government decree. (12.4.2019/505)

The state supervisory authority shall, where necessary, urge the project proponent to apply for a permit under § 3 from the permit authority or for a drainage proceeding under § 4.

Implementation of Drainage

During drainage, Chapter 2, §§ 7 and 8 shall be observed. The drainage shall also be carried out in such a way that another's area is not waterlogged or caused other loss of benefit. If the loss of benefit caused by the land becoming waterlogged or by other causes is, however, considerably less than the costs it would entail for the project proponent to prevent such a consequence, the project proponent may compensate for the loss of benefit with money.

The parties may agree to form or expand a wetland area that reduces drainage costs or promotes environmental protection or flood control, and on any compensation for loss of benefit as a result of these measures.

From an area belonging to an unincorporated partnership of a joint property unit or from a part of such an area, a wetland area or a part of such an area may be formed by a decision at a drainage proceeding, if the measure does not cause significant nuisance with regard to the use of the area.

Maintenance and Use of Ditches

The beneficiary or beneficiaries shall maintain a ditch in the manner prescribed in § 7. If a drainage association has been formed to manage the matters arising from the drainage, the association shall ensure that the ditch is maintained.

If a ditch as a whole can be considered to have transformed into a channel in a natural-like state, what is prescribed in this chapter about drainage shall apply to the maintenance and use of the ditch, regardless of what is prescribed in subsection 1.

The land around a pipeline for runoff or wastewater may not be used in such a way that the pipeline may be damaged or its maintenance is made unreasonably difficult.

Right to Drainage on Another's Land

If an agreement is not reached between the beneficiary and the owner of an area needed to carry out the drainage, the beneficiary may be granted the right to:

lead water into another's ditch,

construct a ditch or a protective embankment or pumping station on another's land that is needed for the drainage, or

clear a stream or rivulet on another's land.

A right as referred to in subsection 1 may be granted if it is needed for the appropriate drainage of the land or for preventing a consequence as referred to in § 7, subsection 1. The right to lead water into another's piped ditch may be granted only if it is not otherwise possible to divert the water without unreasonable costs. The municipal environmental protection authority shall decide whether this right is to be granted, unless the drainage requires a permit from the permit authority or a decision at a drainage proceeding.

In matters concerning the granting of such a right as referred to in subsection 1, point 2, in detailed plan areas, § 132, subsections 2 and 3 of the Building Act shall apply, unless:

the matter concerns a shore detailed plan area as referred to in Chapter 10 of the Land Use and Building Act,

the drainage serves the drainage of agricultural and forestry areas designated in the detailed plan,

the drainage largely takes place outside the detailed plan area,

the drainage causes nuisance or a need to divert water for a property owned by a third party, or

the drainage requires a permit from the permit authority or a decision at a drainage proceeding.

(21.4.2023/774)
Subsection 3 has been amended by Act 774/2023, which enters into force on 1 January 2025. The previous form reads:
In matters concerning the granting of such a right as referred to in subsection 1, point 2, in detailed plan areas, § 161 a, subsections 2 and 3 of the Land Use and Building Act shall apply, unless:

1) the matter concerns a shore detailed plan area as referred to in Chapter 10 of the Land Use and Building Act,

2) the drainage serves the drainage of agricultural and forestry areas designated in the detailed plan,

3) the drainage largely takes place outside the detailed plan area,

4) the drainage causes nuisance or a need to divert water for a property owned by a third party, or

5) the drainage requires a permit from the permit authority or a decision at a drainage proceeding.

Implementation of Drainage on Another's Land

A ditch constructed on another's land shall be located on the boundary between the properties or otherwise in a place that causes the property owner as little nuisance as possible. An open ditch that is not constructed on a boundary may not be constructed on another's land that has been taken into special use, unless the owner of the area consents to this, nor on another's tiled-drained area, unless it is necessary. The ditch is considered to include, on either side of the channel, a ditch bank with a width of one meter, unless it has been determined that it shall be wider or the nature of the ground requires a wider ditch bank.

The landowner has the right to make use of the soil that has been taken up from the ditch. If the landowner does not want to use the soil, the project proponent shall either place the soil beside the ditch or elsewhere where it does not cause the landowner nuisance and does not prevent water from flowing into the ditch or cause the ditch slope to collapse, or the project proponent shall remove the soil.

A ditch that serves the drainage of another's property may not be filled in or the flow of water in the ditch obstructed without reason. When a ditch has been constructed on another's land, the owner of the area may be granted the right to change the location and course of the ditch at their own expense, if the change does not reduce the benefit of the ditch or cause significant additional costs for the beneficiary.

Permanence of a Right concerning Drainage

A right to construct a ditch on another's land and to lead water into another's ditch that is based on a written agreement between the parties or on a decision as referred to in § 9 shall apply regardless of subsequent changes in the ownership of the properties.

If a ditch that was previously located on only one property's area comes to be located on several properties' areas as a result of a change in the property division and nothing else has been agreed upon or decided, the ditch is considered to have been constructed on another's land by virtue of an agreement. What is prescribed in subsection 1 shall apply to such a ditch.

In a new decision on drainage, changes may be made, by virtue of the provisions in this chapter, to a previous decision or otherwise to legal relations concerning drainage.

Compensation for Loss of Benefit and Liability for Water Diversion

A loss of benefit as a result of drainage or as a result of a right as referred to in § 9 shall be compensated in accordance with Chapter 13.

If water is led into a stream on another's land, the landowner has the right to compensation only for the area taken into use for a new stream channel or for a significant widening of the stream channel.

A person who leads water into another's ditch or into a stream that another has cleared is obliged to pay compensation for the costs of constructing the ditch or clearing the stream. A person who leads water into another's ditch is also obliged to participate in a necessary widening and necessary maintenance of the ditch. The compensation shall be determined taking into account the provisions on joint drainage in this chapter.

If a piped ditch needs to be widened for water to be led into the ditch by virtue of a right as referred to in § 9, the widening and any additional work shall be carried out by the person who leads water into the ditch.

Fairways and Pipelines

If, for drainage, it is necessary to construct a new ditch under a public road, railway, cable, or gas pipeline, to move a cable or gas pipeline, or to widen a stream or a ditch that runs through a road, the project proponent has the right to demand that the measure be carried out in such a way that the land above the road, railway, cable, or gas pipeline can be drained to the depth that has been established in accordance with § 15, subsection 2.

The project proponent shall, at their own expense, construct the ditch referred to in subsection 1 and widen the channel. The road keeper, railway keeper, or the owner of a cable or gas pipeline shall, however, at their own expense, construct and maintain bridges and culverts and their foundations or move the cable or gas pipeline.

If the costs referred to in subsection 2 are unreasonably high in comparison with the benefit of the drainage, the road keeper, railway keeper, or the owner of the cable or gas pipeline is not obliged to construct the bridge or culvert or move the cable or gas pipeline. They shall, however, compensate for the loss of benefit that follows from the prevention of a land drainage that is to be considered necessary. No compensation shall, however, be paid for a loss of benefit that has already been compensated.

If, for drainage under this chapter, it is necessary to construct a new ditch under a private road or to widen a stream or a ditch that runs through such a road, and a new bridge or culvert is therefore needed or an existing bridge or culvert must be altered, the work shall be carried out at the project proponent's expense in such a way that the bridge or culvert, after the work is completed, is in a condition that is at least equivalent to the previous one. The road keeper is responsible for the maintenance of the bridge or culvert.

Use of Another's Ditch for Purposes Other Than Land Drainage

If an agreement on the matter is not reached, the municipal environmental protection authority may, upon application, grant the right to lead water into another's ditch also when it is not a matter of diverting water that hinders the use of an area. If the matter is connected to an environmental permit matter, this right is, however, granted by the competent permit authority as referred to in § 34 of the Environmental Protection Act. (27.6.2014/531)

The right to lead water into another's ditch may be granted if this does not cause unreasonable nuisance. The right to lead water into a ditch that extends through an area belonging to another and which has been taken into special use may not, however, be granted.

A person who is granted the right to lead water into another's ditch is obliged to carry out such work to widen, restore, and maintain the ditch as is caused by the water being led into it and to ensure that the measure does not cause damage or nuisance that can be avoided at a reasonable cost. A decision as referred to in subsection 1 may, where necessary, be accompanied by necessary conditions on how the work is to be carried out.

If a measure as referred to in subsection 3 is of benefit to another, the provisions concerning their obligation to participate in the costs of the measures and concerning the procedure for ordering participation in the costs that are prescribed for drainage shall apply. If the benefit of leading water into the ditch has increased due to changes in the leading of the water, the distribution of maintenance responsibility among the beneficiaries may be reviewed so that it corresponds to the changed situation.

Preparation of a Drainage Plan

If the drainage requires a permit from the permit authority or a decision at a drainage proceeding, or if the nature or scope of the matter otherwise requires it, a drainage plan shall be drawn up.

The drainage plan shall contain information about the project, how it is to be implemented and the drainage depth, an account of the benefit of the project, and an assessment of its consequences. When the drainage depth is determined, the nature of the soil, the slope conditions, and the need for drainage shall be taken into account. More detailed provisions on the content of the drainage plan, the determination of the drainage depth, and the division of the drainage area into sections may be issued by Government decree.

The applicant or another beneficiary is responsible for ensuring that a drainage plan is drawn up. Before the drainage plan is established, the permit authority or the surveyor shall make the changes and additions to the plan that are needed under this Act. If, according to subsection 1, a drainage plan is to be drawn up and no plan has been submitted, the surveyor or the permit authority shall see to it that a drainage plan is obtained.

Establishment of a Drainage Plan

In a permit decision or the decision made at a drainage proceeding, a drainage plan, an associated cost estimate, and a distribution list for the costs shall be established.

When a drainage plan is established at a drainage proceeding, the decision shall be accompanied by the necessary conditions for the implementation of the project and for the monitoring of its consequences, in compliance with the applicable parts of Chapter 3, § 10, subsection 1, and § 11, subsection 1. What is prescribed in Chapter 3, § 8, subsections 2 and 3 about the time for implementing a project and about extending that time also applies in applicable parts to drainage plans to be established at a drainage proceeding.

Drainage may be carried out according to an established drainage plan. When the drainage is carried out, minor deviations from the established drainage plan may be made where necessary without amending the plan, if this does not significantly affect the costs and the benefit of the drainage.

Participation in Joint Drainage

All beneficiaries have the right to participate in joint drainage. Every beneficiary has the right to demand that the drainage be carried out in such a way that it brings the greatest possible benefit also to their land, but without the original purpose of the drainage being changed or the costs being unreasonably increased.

At the demand of a beneficiary, the other beneficiaries are obliged to participate in joint drainage.

Drainage Plan for Joint Drainage

A drainage plan for joint drainage shall be established to the extent necessary for the drainage to be carried out for the active partners.

After the final meeting at the drainage proceeding, the active partners do not have the right to withdraw from the project. The drainage plan may not, however, be established if all active partners withdraw from demanding drainage.

Liability for Costs

Drainage costs are considered to be the costs caused by:

the planning of the project, the handling of the matter, and the acquisition of funds,

the management of the drainage association's affairs while the project is being implemented,

the implementation of the project and compensation for the loss of benefit that the project leads to, and

other comparable measures in connection with the project.

Unless otherwise prescribed below, the beneficiaries shall, in proportion to the benefit they receive from the joint drainage, be liable for the drainage costs caused by the land being drained to the depth referred to in § 15, subsection 2 in a drainage area or on a section of a drainage area, or by water being led for some other purpose. The beneficiaries may agree that the costs shall be distributed in some other way than what is prescribed in this chapter.

The beneficiaries shall be liable for the maintenance costs in accordance with subsection 2, unless special reasons require a different distribution of the costs. A person who no longer has any benefit from a joint ditch as a result of a new ditch having been constructed or the circumstances otherwise having changed shall be exempted from participating in the maintenance costs. If the benefit of leading water into the ditch has increased due to changes in the leading of the water, the distribution of maintenance responsibility among the beneficiaries may be reviewed so that it corresponds to the changed situation.

If a drainage area has been divided into sections and a certain section is located so that a joint ditch does not need to be constructed on it to drain another section, it shall be determined in the distribution of the drainage costs to what parts and in what proportion the beneficiaries of the section where no ditch needs to be constructed shall be liable for the costs attributable to the drainage area.

Beneficiaries' Joint and Several Liability

If a beneficiary does not pay their share of the drainage costs, the other beneficiaries are obliged to pay this share. It shall be divided among the beneficiaries in the same proportion as the drainage costs.

If the share can be collected later from the person who has failed to pay their share, the funds shall be distributed according to the same principles among those who have paid the share.

Maximum Amount of Costs

An active partner is liable for the costs of joint drainage up to a maximum of the amount it would cost to drain this partner's area separately. If, in the distribution of costs among the beneficiaries, it turns out that someone's share is greater than the amount in question, this beneficiary's share shall be limited to that amount.

A passive partner is obliged to participate in the drainage costs up to a maximum amount corresponding to the benefit that the joint drainage brings to the partner's area. In a decision on drainage, a passive partner may be given the right to pay their share within a period of at most ten years. The partner is then obliged to annually pay interest according to § 3, subsection 2 of the Interest Act (633/1982) on the unpaid amount.

Drainage Association

For joint drainage, a drainage association shall be formed if the beneficiaries are at least three and:

a permit from the permit authority is required for the drainage,

no agreement can be reached on joint drainage, or

any of the beneficiaries demands that an association be formed and an association is considered necessary for the implementation of the drainage, the maintenance of the ditches, or the management of other matters related to the drainage.

An association may, under the conditions stated in subsection 1, also be formed at the request of the supervisory authority, if the beneficiaries have not taken measures to form an association and one is still considered necessary for the management of matters related to the drainage.

Members of a Drainage Association

The members of a drainage association are its beneficiaries.

A person who later wants to lead water into a joint ditch constructed by a drainage association and who can be considered to benefit from the drainage shall be admitted as a member by a decision of the association's meeting. The meeting shall determine the beneficiary's share of the drainage costs.

If the property division changes in the drainage area for joint drainage, the owner of a new property becomes a member of the drainage association to the extent that the property's area is part of the drainage area.

Formation of a Drainage Association and the Association's Bylaws

A drainage association shall be formed when a drainage matter is handled by the permit authority or at a drainage proceeding, unless the beneficiaries agree otherwise on the formation. If a drainage association is formed under § 22, subsection 2 at the request of the supervisory authority, the matter shall be decided at a drainage proceeding.

The authority that decides the drainage matter shall establish the association's bylaws, the members' voting rights and their shares of the drainage costs, and appoint the first representatives.

Decision-Making in Drainage Associations

In a drainage association, each member has a voting right that corresponds to the ratio between the drainage costs and the share that the member has been obliged to pay in the drainage plan.

A decision for a project to be abandoned can be made by the meeting only if it has been announced in the notice of the meeting that this matter will be considered and all the active partners present support the decision.

Dissolution of a Drainage Association

If the drainage association is dissolved, the ditches shall be restored to a natural-like state, taking the circumstances into account.

A matter concerning the dissolution of a drainage association shall be handled at a drainage proceeding. When handling the matter, the provisions in Chapter 12, § 19 on the dissolution of an association shall be observed in applicable parts.

Fees Collected from Members

The members of a drainage association are obliged to pay fees to cover the drainage costs according to what the association's meeting decides.

When the drainage has been carried out, the representatives shall present an adjusted calculation of the cost distribution for the association's meeting to approve. If it appears from the adjusted calculation that the distribution of the benefit that the members receive from the drainage deviates significantly from what was estimated when their share in the association was determined, the cost distribution shall be corrected accordingly. The procedure is the same if the drainage association admits a new partner.

An owner of such a new property as referred to in § 23, subsection 3 is obliged to participate in the drainage costs after the owner's partnership has been confirmed at the association's meeting. New property owners shall be specially notified that a meeting will be held. Regarding the lien for costs that have fallen due for payment before the change in the property division, § 30 shall, however, be observed.

The fees may be collected based on the distribution list that the association's meeting has approved. If a member does not pay their fee, the provisions in § 20 shall be observed.

Advance Fees

The drainage association's meeting may decide to collect advance fees from its members. Passive partners may not, however, be obliged to pay advance fees.

In case of delay in the payment of an advance fee, the partner is obliged to pay default interest according to § 4 of the Interest Act on the amount that has not been paid in time, unless the association's meeting decides on a lower interest rate.

Fees Collected from Other Beneficiaries

If completed drainage brings such significant benefit to someone other than a member of the drainage association that is due to something other than the conditions on the property having improved as a result of the drainage, the beneficiary is obliged to participate in the drainage costs with an amount that at most corresponds to the value of the benefit.

The decision to oblige such another beneficiary as referred to in subsection 1 to participate in the drainage costs shall be made at a drainage proceeding upon the application of the drainage association. Regarding the collection of a payment share, the provisions in this chapter on collecting fees from partners in the association apply in applicable parts.

Property Lien

The beneficiary's property constitutes a lien in accordance with Chapter 20 of the Land Code (540/1995) for:

the beneficiary's share of the costs according to an established drainage plan or according to a decision of the association's meeting,

the share of the costs that the beneficiary has been obliged to pay under § 29 and the beneficiary's share of the maintenance costs,

other cost shares that arise for the beneficiary after the handling of the drainage matter has been concluded and which are due to the drainage,

interest on cost shares as referred to in points 1–3.

When a decision on a drainage matter has been issued, the permit authority shall notify the registration authority of the payment shares referred to in subsection 1, points 1 and 2, and the interest on them for entry in the title and mortgage register.

If an appeal is lodged against a decision concerning a payment share, the permit authority shall without delay notify the registration authority of this. The permit authority shall also notify the registration authority of a decision in the matter after the decision has gained legal force. What is prescribed in this section about the permit authority shall apply to the state supervisory authority if the matter has been decided at a drainage proceeding.

The association's representatives shall without delay report the cost shares that the association's meeting has decided on and the interest on them, as well as the cost shares that have arisen as a result of the drainage after the drainage plan was established and the interest on them, to the registration authority for entry in the title and mortgage register. The representatives shall also report changes in the cost shares if the distribution of the costs has been adjusted or corrected under § 27, subsection 2 by the association's meeting or amended due to a complaint filed under Chapter 12, § 17.

How a Drainage Proceeding is Initiated

A drainage proceeding shall be applied for from the competent state supervisory authority. If the project proponent is not a natural person, the application shall be made electronically. The supervisory authority may, for special reasons, approve that the application be submitted on paper. The project proponent shall, at the request of the supervisory authority, submit the application documents on paper if it is needed for the handling of the matter. The authority shall appoint an employee within the environmental administration who acts under official responsibility and has sufficient expertise (surveyor) to hold the drainage proceeding. More detailed provisions on the qualification requirements for surveyors may be issued by Government decree. (12.4.2019/505)

The surveyor shall call two of the lay judges who have been appointed to be engaged in property proceedings in the municipality or municipalities where the project primarily has effects as lay judges at the proceeding. The drainage proceeding may be carried out without lay judges if, due to the nature of the matter, it is clearly unnecessary to engage lay judges and none of the parties demands that lay judges be engaged.

Drainage matters concerning several drainage areas may be handled at the same drainage proceeding if the matters can be handled at the same time without this leading to delay or other nuisances.

Drainage to be Handled by the Permit Authority

If a surveyor notices that the drainage or a measure to be taken in connection with it requires a permit from the permit authority, the surveyor shall urge the person who has applied for the proceeding to apply for a permit.

The proposal for a drainage plan that has been drawn up at the proceeding or presented at it shall be attached to the permit application.

Proceeding Meeting

At a drainage proceeding, a proceeding meeting shall be held where all matters belonging to the drainage proceeding shall be handled.

The surveyor shall summon those whose rights or interests the drainage matter may concern to the proceeding meeting. The surveyor shall give the state supervisory authority, the fisheries authority, and the municipal environmental protection authority the opportunity to give a statement on the drainage project.

Final Meeting

At a drainage proceeding, in addition to the proceeding meeting, a separate final meeting shall be held if a drainage plan is to be adopted at the drainage proceeding and the application for the proceeding does not contain a necessary plan, or if it is a matter of drainage as referred to in § 4, subsection 1, point 1.

The final meeting shall be held when the surveyor's and lay judges' proposal for a drainage plan is ready. On final meetings, what is otherwise prescribed about proceeding meetings shall apply.

(5.5.2017/257)
Announcement of a Meeting

The proceeding meeting and the final meeting at a drainage proceeding shall be publicly announced at least 14 days before the meeting on the state supervisory authority's website in compliance with § 62 a of the Administrative Procedure Act. Information about the announcement shall also be published in compliance with § 108 of the Local Government Act on the websites of the municipalities whose area the drainage affects. Within the same time, the drainage plan shall be submitted to the authorities mentioned in § 33, subsection 2, and be kept publicly available on the state supervisory authority's website. In addition, the landowners whom the drainage concerns shall be notified of the proceeding meeting and the final meeting by letter. The letter is sent to a known postal address. If the drainage concerns a stream on another's land where there is a power plant or some other structure, the owner of the power plant or structure shall also be notified of the proceeding meeting and the final meeting. (12.4.2019/505)

If the drainage concerns an unincorporated partnership for a joint property unit, the partnership shall be notified of the proceeding meeting and the final meeting in compliance with the applicable parts of Chapter 11, § 11, subsection 2.

In drainage matters of minor significance and in such drainage matters where service under subsections 1 and 2 is not needed due to the nature of the matter, the proceeding meeting and the final meeting may be announced in another way. In matters that do not affect the rights or interests of anyone other than the applicant, no announcement is needed.

Decision in Drainage Matters

When the proceeding meeting or the final meeting has been held, a decision shall be issued at the drainage proceeding. The decision shall contain:

the drainage plan that has been handled at the proceeding,

a decision on remarks or demands that have been made,

provisions on how the drainage is to be carried out and the ditch maintained,

an estimate of the drainage costs,

a distribution of the expenses,

provisions on compensation for loss of benefit as a result of the drainage, and

a calculation of the costs of the drainage proceeding and of the compensation for them to the state.

If the drainage requires an exemption as referred to in Chapter 2, § 11, subsection 2, no decision may be issued at a drainage proceeding until the permit authority has decided the question of granting an exemption.

On a decision that the permit authority issues in drainage matters, the provisions in subsection 1 on the content of a decision at drainage proceedings shall apply.

Service of a Decision at a Drainage Proceeding (12.4.2019/505)

The decision at a drainage proceeding shall be served on the state supervisory authority's website by public notice in compliance with § 62 a of the Administrative Procedure Act. The decision shall be issued within 30 days from the proceeding meeting or the final meeting, unless the state supervisory authority extends the time for special reasons. (12.4.2019/505)

Those whom the matter concerns shall also be notified of the decision to a known postal address. The decision shall be given to the applicant and a copy of the decision to other parties who have requested it. A copy of the decision shall also be sent to the environmental protection authorities in the concerned municipalities, the state supervisory authority, and the fisheries authority.

(13.12.2013/910)
Land Consolidation due to Drainage

If a land consolidation as referred to in the Act on Land Consolidations due to Water Body Projects (451/1988) may need to be carried out due to drainage, the person who made the decision in the drainage matter shall submit the drainage plan to the National Land Survey of Finland when the decision on the plan has gained legal force.

Costs for Drainage Proceedings

The costs for a drainage proceeding shall be paid by the applicant. Costs for a drainage proceeding are considered to be the costs for holding meetings and the fees for lay judges and assisting personnel. Daily allowances and travel expense reimbursements for surveyors are paid by the state.

If the permit authority or the surveyor obtains a drainage plan at the drainage proceeding, or if the plan that the applicant or another beneficiary submits requires significant additions, the applicant shall pay the costs that these have caused the state. Provisions on the amount are issued by a decree of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in accordance with the principles stated in the Act on Criteria for Charges Payable to the State (150/1992).

The applicant may be obliged to pay an advance fee for the costs of a drainage proceeding. When handling the matter, Chapter 18, § 12, subsection 3 shall be observed in applicable parts.

Chapter 6
Permanent Change of the Mean Water Level

Scope

This chapter applies to the permanent change of the mean water level in a lake or a pond by lowering the mean water level (lowering of the mean water level) or raising it (raising of the mean water level). Chapter 5 prescribes the draining of land by drainage, Chapter 7 prescribes water regulation, and Chapter 8 prescribes the change of the mean water level for the utilization of hydropower.

The provisions in §§ 2–4, 7, 10, and 11 of this chapter also apply to the embankment of shores and the clearing of rivers, even if the mean water level is not changed in connection with the embankment or clearing.

Private Benefit of Lowering or Raising the Mean Water Level

As a private benefit of lowering or raising the mean water level is considered in this chapter that the use value of a water area or a shore property increases with regard to the purpose for which the area or property is used or with regard to the conditions under which it can most closely be used.

Permit Applicant

A permit to lower or raise the mean water level may be applied for by:

a property owner who has such a private benefit from the project as is referred to in § 2,

an association that the beneficiaries have formed under this Act,

a partner or partnership of a joint water area,

a concerned state authority, or

a municipality.

Special Conditions for Changing the Mean Water Level

If it is not a project required by a public need, a permit may not be granted for such projects for raising or lowering the mean water level that lead to:

such a significant impairment of the possibilities to use a shore property that causes unreasonable nuisance or damage to the owner or possessor of the area, unless the owner or possessor has consented to the project, or

a significant impairment of a special nature conservation value.

Consent of the Area's Owners

If the intention of a project is to lower the mean water level in a lake or a pond, it is a condition for a permit to be granted that the owners of the water area that constitutes at least three-quarters of the surface area of the lake or pond give their written consent to the lowering.

If the intention of the project is to raise the mean water level in a lake or a pond, a permit may be granted if the owners of at least three-quarters of the land area that is submerged give their written consent to the raising. A permit may also be granted if the applicant, based on ownership or a permanent right of use, has control over more than half of the area that is submerged.

Consent of the area's owners is not required, however, if the change in the mean water level is required by a public need or another purpose that is important from a public point of view, such as the community's water supply, protection against floods, use of the water body for recreation, or nature conservation.

(8.9.2017/611)
Right of Use to Another's Area

Provisions on the granting of a right of use to another's area that is submerged are in Chapter 2, §§ 13 and 13 a. If the applicant is a water-law association founded by the beneficiaries, the areas belonging to the members of the association are also taken into account when the fulfillment of the conditions under Chapter 2, § 13, subsection 2, point 2 is assessed.

Participation in the Costs of Lowering the Mean Water Level

If those who support a project aimed at lowering the mean water level receive a benefit that corresponds to more than half of the value of the private benefit that the project brings, everyone who benefits from the project shall participate in the costs of the project.

In the distribution of the costs among the beneficiaries, what is prescribed about drainage in Chapter 5, §§ 19 and 20 shall be observed in applicable parts. Regarding the lien for the costs, Chapter 5, § 30 shall apply correspondingly.

If the lowering of the mean water level in a case as referred to in subsection 1, in addition to private benefit, also brings another significant benefit, the permit authority may, in connection with granting the permit, upon application, oblige the person who receives such a benefit to participate in the costs of the project. The amount that the beneficiary shall be liable for shall be reasonable and at most amount to the benefit that accrues to the beneficiary.

Participation in the Costs of Raising the Mean Water Level

The permit authority may, in its permit decision, upon application, oblige a person who has a private benefit from a project aimed at raising the mean water level to participate in the costs of implementing the project. The amount that the beneficiary is obliged to pay shall correspond to the beneficiary's share of the total benefit of the project. The amount may not, however, exceed the private benefit that the beneficiary has from the project.

Association Formed for Raising the Mean Water Level

If a permit to raise the mean water level is sought by more than one applicant, an association shall be formed in accordance with Chapter 12 to carry out the raising. The permit authority shall establish the association's bylaws with a permit decision in the manner prescribed in Chapter 12, § 5.

All who benefit from the project may become members of the association. If the property division changes, the owner of the new property is a member of the association to the extent that the property's area is part of the area that benefits from the project.

Association Formed for Lowering the Mean Water Level

If a permit to lower the mean water level is sought by more than one applicant, an association shall be formed in accordance with Chapter 12 to carry out the lowering.

Regarding the association, what is prescribed in § 9 about an association formed for raising the mean water level shall apply. All who have a private benefit from the project are, however, obliged to belong to the association as members, if those who support the project receive a benefit that corresponds to more than half of the value of the private benefit that the project brings.

Decision-Making in an Association Formed for Lowering the Mean Water Level

In an association that has been formed for lowering the mean water level, each member has such a voting right that corresponds to the ratio between the share that the member has been obliged to pay in the project plan and the total costs of the project.

Collection of Fees

On the collection of fees from the members of the association, what is prescribed about drainage associations in Chapter 5, §§ 27 and 28 shall apply.

Chapter 7
Water Regulation

Scope

This chapter applies to the continuous regulation of water flow and water level to other than a minor extent and to the continuous tapping of water from one water body to another or from one part of a water body to another (water regulation).

Regulation Permit

The benefit or loss that the regulation brings is assessed according to Chapter 3, §§ 6 and 7. The benefit of increased hydropower is, however, assessed according to Chapter 8, § 2, subsection 2.

In addition to what is prescribed in Chapter 3, §§ 10–14, a decision concerning a permit for water regulation shall include conditions on the tapping of water.

If conditions as referred to in subsection 2 or Chapter 3, § 10, subsection 2 have been issued for a project that has previously been carried out in the water body or the part of a water body that the regulation concerns, these may be amended. Regarding compensation, Chapter 3, § 21, subsection 3 shall apply correspondingly. (30.12.2013/1193)

Use of a Structure

In a permit concerning water regulation, the owner of a structure suitable for regulation may be obliged to use the structure in the manner that the regulation requires.

A loss of benefit that is due to the structure being used shall be compensated. At the request of the owner of the structure, the permit applicant may also be obliged to redeem the structure instead of paying compensation.

(12.4.2019/505)
Proposal for Participation in Water Regulation

If a regulation clearly brings benefit also to others, the person who applies for a permit for the regulation shall, by submitting a proposal on the matter to the permit authority, invite other beneficiaries to participate in the regulation. If the permit applicant is a state authority, no proposal for participation in the regulation needs to be submitted.

The proposal shall be accompanied by a project plan, information about the beneficiaries and how much benefit they are estimated to receive, as well as a cost estimate for the project.

The permit authority shall serve the proposal by public notice in compliance with § 62 a of the Administrative Procedure Act. The permit authority shall urge the beneficiaries to report their participation in the project to the permit authority. The proposal is not announced if it is clear from the plan attached to the proposal that a permit cannot be granted for a project that corresponds to the plan.

If the proposal for participation in the regulation has been made at a time other than in connection with a permit application, an application for a permit for the project shall be made within one year from the end of the announcement period, provided that the permit authority has not extended the time for the application.

Participation in a Regulation Project

A person who has a significant benefit from a regulation project that another has started has the right to participate in the regulation project. The beneficiary shall submit a written notification of participation to the permit authority within the time specified in the announcement.

If a beneficiary who, according to subsection 1, has the right to participate in the project has announced their intention to participate in its implementation, the permit authority shall, after the water regulation matter has been initiated, instruct the applicant to take measures under Chapter 12 to form a regulation association.

Regulation Association

If a permit for a regulation project is sought by more than one applicant or if a beneficiary, in accordance with § 5, subsection 1, announces their intention to participate in a project that another has started, a regulation association shall be formed for the project. The association shall be formed in the manner prescribed in Chapter 12. The permit authority establishes the association's bylaws through the permit decision in accordance with Chapter 12, § 5.

Members of a Regulation Association

The members of a regulation association are the permit applicants, those who in accordance with § 5 have announced that they are participating in the regulation, and the beneficiaries whom the association has later admitted as members. Even a drainage association or another water-law association may be a member of a regulation association if the permit authority finds it appropriate.

A beneficiary has the right to join a regulation association that has already been formed, if there are justified grounds for admitting the beneficiary as a member.

A member of a regulation association has the right to withdraw from the association if the benefit the member receives is considerably less than what the member was estimated to receive when the association was formed and if the association, despite the withdrawal, is able to meet its obligations.

Decision-Making in a Regulation Association

A member's share and voting right in a regulation association is determined in proportion to the benefit that the regulation brings to the member.

A Member's Liability for Regulation Costs

The liability that the members of a regulation association have for the costs that the regulation gives rise to is determined in proportion to the benefit that the regulation brings to each of them.

Regarding regulation costs and the fees that the members shall pay, what is prescribed about drainage in Chapter 5, §§ 19, 27, and 28 shall apply.

An Outsider Beneficiary's Liability for Regulation Costs

The permit authority may, in its permit decision, upon application, oblige a beneficiary who does not want to participate in a regulation project to participate in the costs of the project. The state is not considered a beneficiary unless the regulation brings a direct benefit to state property or to a state regulation project.

After a notice as referred to in § 4 has been issued, the permit applicant shall verifiably submit to the beneficiary their demand that the latter be obliged to participate in the costs, as well as a copy of the notice.

The permit authority may, upon application, oblige the project proponent to submit an account of how the amount referred to in subsection 1 has been used. The account shall be submitted to the state supervisory authority, where it shall be kept available for the person who has requested the report.

Determining an Outsider Beneficiary's Cost Share

An outsider beneficiary's cost share shall be determined so that it is in reasonable proportion to the beneficiary's share of the total benefit of the project. The cost share may not, however, exceed the benefit that the beneficiary receives from the project.

When the cost share is determined, the following costs shall be taken into account:

the costs of necessary work, devices, and structures for the regulation,

the costs of compensation for loss of benefits, and

a twenty-fold amount of the estimated annual expenses for the maintenance of devices and structures and for the implementation of the regulation.

It may be determined that an outsider beneficiary's share shall be paid as a lump sum or as at most twenty annual, equal amounts.

Chapter 8
Utilization of Hydropower

Scope

This chapter applies to the utilization of hydropower and the construction of hydropower plants.

The construction of a hydropower plant is also considered to include the clearing of water bodies, the establishment of a new channel for a power plant, and other measures aimed at the utilization of hydropower.

Conditions for Granting a Permit

For a permit to build a hydropower plant to be granted, it is required, in addition to what is prescribed in Chapter 3, § 4, that:

the applicant, as an owner or as a holder of a right of use, has the right to the hydropower to be utilized in the project, or

the applicant, in connection with the permit being granted, receives the right to utilize the hydropower in question.

When benefit and loss are assessed according to Chapter 3, §§ 6 and 7, the production value of the hydropower is taken into account as a benefit of utilizing hydropower. The value shall be at least twenty times the price of the average annual production of electricity. When the production value is determined, the benefit of water regulation at the power plant and other benefits that can be specified may also be taken into account.

Transfer of Right of Use to Hydropower

The right to utilize the hydropower or a part of the hydropower that can be extracted from a specific water area (right of use to hydropower) may be transferred to another for a fixed term or permanently. For the transfer agreement to have the effects intended in this Act, it must be made in writing, observing what is prescribed in the Land Code about the form for the transfer of real property.

The right of use to the hydropower on a property that has been transferred to another for a fixed term or permanently may be registered in accordance with Chapter 14 of the Land Code.

(8.9.2017/611)
Right to an Area for a Hydropower Plant

Provisions on the applicant's right to redeem an area belonging to another for a hydropower plant or for its operation are in Chapter 2, § 13 a.

(8.9.2017/611)
Utilization of Jointly Owned Hydropower

An initiative to build a power plant to utilize hydropower may be taken by a person who, on the basis of ownership, transfer of a share in a water area, or a permanent right of use to hydropower, has control over at least one-fifth of such hydropower in a part of a water body that can be appropriately utilized in the power plant. The initiative can also be taken jointly by partners who have control over at least one-fifth of the hydropower to be utilized.

If an agreement cannot be reached on the utilization of the hydropower, the initiator shall submit an invitation as referred to in § 8 to those who have control over at least one-hundredth of the hydropower to be utilized to participate in the project.

The initiator and those who have the right and wish to participate in the project may be granted a permit to build the power plant, if the conditions for granting a permit are otherwise met. The initiator and those who participate in the project may, in connection with the permit, be granted a permanent right to use, against compensation, the shares belonging to other partners in the hydropower, if the project is required by the public need to secure the energy supply.

Initiative when a Right of Use for a Fixed Term Expires

If a hydropower owner does not wish to renew, on previous terms or on new terms that can be considered reasonable, an agreement where a water area has been leased out for the utilization of hydropower or the right of use to the hydropower as referred to in § 3 has been transferred for a fixed term, the holder of the lease or right of use has the right to invite the person who owns the hydropower and other partners in the hydropower to participate in the project in the manner prescribed in this chapter. The holder of the lease or right of use has this right also when their share in the hydropower is less than one-fifth.

Formation of a Limited Company for the Utilization of Jointly Owned Hydropower

For the utilization of jointly owned hydropower according to § 5, a limited company shall be formed, unless otherwise agreed.

Those who participate in the project shall transfer the right of use to their shares in the hydropower to the company in exchange for shares. Each partner in the jointly owned hydropower shall receive shares in a proportion that corresponds to the ratio between the partner's hydropower share and the total hydropower belonging to those who have a share in the company. In the same proportion, the person who has a share in the company shall also subscribe for shares against the share of the share capital that is paid in cash.

If disagreement arises about the company's articles of association or the drawing up of the memorandum of association, a person participating in the project has the right to request the district court to appoint two arbitrators and a chairman for them to decide the dispute, observing in applicable parts what is prescribed in the Arbitration Act (967/1992).

(12.4.2019/505)
Invitation to Participate

The initiator shall invite others who, according to § 5, have the right to participate in the construction of the power plant to this opportunity. The proposal on the matter shall be submitted to the permit authority.

The proposal shall be accompanied by a project plan, an account of who has control over the hydropower to be utilized, and a cost estimate for the project with information on which part of the costs is intended to be financed by those who participate in the project. More detailed provisions on the content of the proposal and the reports to be attached to the proposal may be issued by Government decree.

(12.4.2019/505)
Public Notice of Participation in the Construction of a Hydropower Plant

The permit authority shall serve a proposal as referred to in § 8 by public notice in compliance with § 62 a of the Administrative Procedure Act. The permit authority shall urge those who have the right to participate in the project to, by the date specified in the notice, notify in writing their participation in the project to the permit authority and to present necessary proof of the right to participate. The proposal is not announced if it is clear from the account attached to it that a permit for the project cannot be granted.

After the notice has been published, the initiator shall without delay and verifiably send information about the notice to the other partners in the hydropower to be utilized, if the respective share of the partners is at least one-hundredth of the hydropower.

The partners in the hydropower who do not submit a notification according to subsection 1 within the set time forfeit their right to participate in the project. The same applies to partners who have reported their participation within the set time but who, within 60 days after a verifiably received request, have not signed the articles of association with the attached memorandum of association or do not submit a request according to § 7, subsection 3.

Permit Application

A permit for the project shall be sought within one year from the end of the time that has been specified in the notice as referred to in § 9. Otherwise, the initiative shall be considered to have lapsed. The permit authority may, upon application, extend the time limit.

If it has not been agreed otherwise, the permit application shall be made in the name of the limited company to be formed in accordance with § 7. In connection with the permit application, a report shall be submitted showing that an invitation to participate has been served in accordance with § 9.

Chapter 9
Timber Floating

Scope

This chapter applies to floating that is conducted by virtue of the right for all to use water bodies as regulated in Chapter 2, § 3, and to the places of business needed for floating.

Definitions

In this chapter, the following definitions apply:

floating means that timber is transported in water by being towed in bundles or rafts,

place of business for floating means a place that is needed during floating for tipping, storage, sorting, or bundling of timber, or a safe harbor,

floater means the person responsible for carrying out the floating,

private floating means floating that a timber owner conducts for their own account,

joint floating means floating that several timber owners conduct for a joint account, and

floating damage means such a loss of benefit that has arisen as a result of floating at a place of business for floating or elsewhere and that could not have been foreseen when deciding the permit matter concerning the place of business for floating.

Entirety of Places of Business for Floating

When a matter concerning a permit for a place of business for floating is decided, the significance of the place of business as part of the entirety formed by the places of business for floating shall be taken into account as such a benefit as is referred to in Chapter 3, § 6, subsection 1.

Changing the Purpose of Use for a Place of Business for Floating

The permit authority may, upon application by the floater, allow a place of business for floating to also be used for other transport of timber by waterway.

The decision on the permit for the place of business shall be accompanied by the necessary conditions for avoiding, in accordance with Chapter 2, §§ 7 and 8, nuisances that the use according to subsection 1 causes.

The Floater's Rights

A floater has the right to move fishing gear and other objects that are in a water body if they impede the floating. The fishing gear and objects shall be placed in such a place in the water body or on the shore where they can be easily discovered. They can also be taken into custody to be handed over to the owner.

A floater may temporarily, for floating, store timber on the ice, if the owner of the water area or of a shore that has been taken into special use has given their consent to it. The permit authority may, upon application, allow measures as referred to in this subsection.

A loss of benefit as a result of measures as referred to in this section shall be compensated as prescribed in Chapter 13.

Use of Areas and Constructions

Anyone who conducts floating in a water body has the right to use:

an area for which a right of use for floating has been granted under this Act,

the constructions on the area that, according to a decision, shall be constructed there for floating, and

devices that have been installed on the area for timber to be tipped into or lifted out of the water.

The user shall agree on the use in detail with the person who owns the constructions and devices. The user shall also, as compensation to the owner, pay such a share of the annual capital and maintenance costs that corresponds to the use and can be considered reasonable.

Joint Floating

Floating for timber owners' joint account shall be carried out as joint floating. The permit authority may, however, upon application, allow private floating in a specific area, if private floating, with regard to the costs of transporting the timber to be floated in the water body, is more advantageous than joint floating and floating of the timber as private floating does not cause nuisance to the organization of floating in general or to other use of the water body.

A timber owner always has the right to privately float timber for household needs.

Compensation for Floating Damage

A floating association shall compensate for floating damage that has been caused by floating carried out in its area of activity. Floating damage that has been caused by floating carried out elsewhere than in the floating association's area of activity shall be compensated by the floater.

A claim for compensation for floating damage shall be made in writing to the person liable for compensation by the end of the calendar year following the year in which the damage occurred. If the parties cannot agree on compensation for the floating damage, the matter may be initiated at the permit authority as a separate compensation matter.

Floating Timber that has been Left on the Shore or in the Water Body

After the floating, the floater shall collect floating timber that has been left on the shore or in the water body. Floating timber that, in connection with the floating, has been left on the shore or in the water body may be taken into custody by the owner or possessor of the shore or water area or by a partner in a joint water area. Floating timber that has sunk or is about to sink in the water body may be taken into custody by the person who has a nuisance from the floating timber.

A person who has taken into custody floating timber that has been floated the same calendar year shall, within one month of the taking into custody, notify the floater of this. If it is not necessary to notify the floater that floating timber has been taken into custody or if the floater does not, within three months of the notification, take possession of the timber, the person who has taken the timber into custody may keep it. If the floater takes possession of the timber, the floater shall compensate the person who has taken the timber into custody for the costs of the taking into custody and the notification.

The provisions in subsection 1 do not apply to timber that is stored in such a place for storage, sorting, or bundling of timber as is specified in the permit for the place of business for floating.

Removal of Sunken Timber that Causes Nuisance

The permit authority may oblige a floater to clear the water body of timber that has been left after the floating and has sunk or is about to sink or from floating equipment, if the timber or equipment causes nuisance to the use of the water body. If the floater no longer exists, the order may be directed to the person who last conducted floating in the water body. The state supervisory authority or someone who has a nuisance from the circumstances may apply for the floater to be obliged to clear the water body. When handling the matter, Chapter 14 shall be observed in applicable parts.

If the floating has ceased and there is no longer a functioning floating association, the state supervisory authority may, regardless of subsection 1, clear the water body of sunken timber and other floating remnants that cause danger or nuisance, provided that the measure does not give rise to such changes or have such consequences as are referred to in Chapter 3, § 2.

If the state supervisory authority has cleared the water body under subsection 1 or 2, the timber that is lifted out of the water body passes into state ownership.

The Floating Association and its Tasks

For the conduct of joint floating, a floating association shall be formed in accordance with Chapter 12, if there is not already a functioning floating association in the area. The floating association's task is to conduct joint floating in the area of activity specified in the association's bylaws, to manage the association's property, and to perform other tasks that fall to the association under this Act.

A floating association may also undertake to handle other tasks related to floating. The association may, for profit, use property acquired for floating, if the association's own tasks do not suffer from it. The association may not conduct other activities.

Members of the Floating Association

The members of a floating association are the timber owners whose timber is floated jointly.

The forest owners have the right to a joint representative in the floating association. The association shall ask each forest centre that sends timber from its area of activity for floating to the association to appoint its candidate for the position of representative for the forest owners. As the representative for the forest owners, the permit authority shall appoint the candidate who best represents the forest owners in the association's area of activity.

The person who represents the forest owners in the floating association has the right to reasonable compensation for their duties from the forest centre that appointed them as a candidate. If the floating timber originates from the areas of activity of several forest centres, the forest centres shall pay compensation in proportion to how the area from which the floating timber comes is divided among the forest centres' areas of activity. If disputes arise about the amount of the compensation or about the distribution of the compensation between the forest centres, a matter may be initiated at the permit authority in the manner prescribed in Chapter 11.

Bylaws of the Floating Association

In addition to what is prescribed in Chapter 12, § 4, the bylaws of a floating association shall also state:

what the association's area of activity is,

how the floating manager is employed, and

when and how the timber owners shall report the timber to be floated.

Meeting of the Floating Association

When matters concerning a specific year's floating are handled by the floating association's meeting, the members of the association who have reported timber for floating that year or whose timber has been floated by the association that year, as well as the forest owners' representatives, may participate.

At the floating association's meeting, with the exception of its constituent meeting, the forest owners' representatives have a number of votes that constitutes one-fifth of the total number of votes for the members who participate in the voting.

Board and Floating Manager of the Floating Association

The floating association shall have a board consisting of the members whom the association's meeting has elected and of the forest owners' representatives. Regarding the appointment of the forest owners' representatives and the representative's fee, the applicable parts of § 12 shall apply. The floating association shall also have a floating manager. Regarding the board and the floating manager, what is prescribed in Chapter 12, § 13 about the board and representatives shall apply.

Transfer and Seizure of Real Property

A floating association may transfer or, as security for a debt, mortgage real property belonging to it, if the permit authority, upon application, has granted a permit for it. The application shall be rejected if it is necessary for the floating association to continue to own the property with regard to continued floating.

The real property referred to in subsection 1 and the devices and structures belonging to the property may not be seized for any claim other than one that is mortgaged in the property in question.

Funds

A floating association may have funds that are managed according to established bylaws separately from the association's other assets and which are used for equalizing the costs of acquiring and maintaining property, for paying pensions, for other care of representatives and employees, for the aftercare of floating and the removal of sunken timber, and for paying taxes, compensations, and other payments that fall due after the end of the floating year.

The floating association shall apply for the permit authority's confirmation of the meeting's decision to establish a fund and to adopt bylaws for the fund. The permit authority may make such amendments to the bylaws as are necessary to secure the interests of the association members.

Fund assets may be seized only for such debts for whose payment the fund assets, according to the bylaws, are to be used.

Fees Collected from the Members of the Floating Association

The floating association covers the annual costs for joint floating with fees that the association collects from its members. The fees shall be fair and reasonable and be in proportion to the amount of the association's services that each member utilizes.

Dissolution of a Floating Association

A floating association shall be dissolved when joint floating is no longer conducted in a water body or a certain part of a water body. If the association's board has not, within five years after the floating has ceased, taken the necessary measures to dissolve the association, the state supervisory authority shall apply to the permit authority for the floating association to be dissolved and for the board to be obliged to take the necessary measures or for liquidators to be appointed. Even the board that is active or was last active for the floating association may submit an application for the association to be dissolved and liquidators to be appointed. The liquidators may be one or more depending on how extensive the task is. In their task, the liquidators have the same powers as the board of the floating association.

When measures to dissolve a floating association have been initiated, the association's board or the liquidators appointed for the task exercise the decision-making power that belongs to the meeting. If the matter concerns floating carried out during a certain year, the decision-making power that belongs to the meeting is, however, exercised by those who were members of the association that year.

Liquidation Measures

Movable and real property belonging to a floating association and not needed to be kept in the water body area for ongoing floating shall be realized. The person responsible for the liquidation measures shall present a proposal for the realization of the floating association's real property and submit an application for this to the permit authority. The permit authority shall decide which part of the real property is to be realized. The rest of the real property shall be transferred to the state.

The funds from the sale of the floating association's property shall be used to pay the association's debts. The remaining funds shall be used for the aftercare of the floating in the concerned water body areas. The permit authority may, upon the application of either the person responsible for the liquidation measures or the state supervisory authority, decide that the funds shall be transferred to the state supervisory authority, if the latter undertakes to arrange for the aftercare as referred to in § 21.

The liquidators' assignment ends when all the floating association's assets and liabilities have been settled or when the funds have been transferred to the state supervisory authority in accordance with subsection 2.

Aftercare

If the floating in a water body or a certain part of a water body has ceased and there is no longer a functioning floating association in the area, the state supervisory authority may apply to the permit authority for the permits granted for places of business for floating to cease to be valid.

The state supervisory authority shall take measures to remove or alter devices and structures that have been installed for floating that has been conducted earlier and which may cause danger or nuisance to the use of the water body, as well as measures to restore the conditions in a channel to what they were before the clearing. If the measures give rise to such a change or consequence as is referred to in Chapter 3, § 2, a permit for the measures shall be sought. The matter can be handled at the same time as the application referred to in subsection 1 or separately.

Chapter 10
Fairways and Other Maritime Traffic Areas

Scope

This chapter applies to public fairways and other maritime traffic areas.

For the establishment of a public fairway and for the construction and maintenance of the fairway, the applicable parts of what is prescribed about water management projects and permits for such projects shall apply, unless otherwise prescribed in this chapter.

Establishment of a Public Fairway

The permit authority may, upon application by the Finnish Transport Agency, decide that such a part of a water body that it is necessary to keep open for public ship or boat traffic shall be a public fairway.

The permit authority may, upon application, decide that such a part of a water body that does not belong to a public fairway, but which it is necessary to keep open for public ship or boat traffic, shall be a public local fairway. Public boat traffic also includes traffic with recreational boats.

A public fairway or a public local fairway may also be established in a water body that has a king's vein.

Conditions for the Establishment of a Public Fairway

The part of a water body that is established as a public fairway shall meet the requirements that, taking into account the traffic in the water body, can reasonably be placed on a public fairway. The permit authority's decision shall state the course of the public fairway. If the course of the fairway in some respect is determined so that it deviates from what is stated in the application, the applicant shall be given the opportunity to comment on this before the decision is made.

A decision to establish a fairway shall also contain provisions on dredging and placement of dredged material in the water area and on other measures needed for the construction of the fairway. The permit authority may, however, taking into account the scope of the matter or for some other reason, issue a separate decision on the fairway before a decision on the above-mentioned measures is made.

The permit authority shall, in the decision on the establishment of a fairway, determine when it is to be taken into use, if it is a public local fairway. The Finnish Transport Agency decides when public fairways are taken into use.

Amendment of a Decision on a Public Fairway

A legally binding decision on a public fairway may, upon application, be amended or the fairway withdrawn, observing in applicable parts the provisions on the establishment of a fairway. If the person who is the principal for the fairway opposes a demand for the fairway to be amended or withdrawn, it is also required that the fairway or its use has a harmful effect that was not foreseen when the fairway was established or that the circumstances have later changed significantly.

The person who is the principal for a public fairway may, notwithstanding what is prescribed in subsection 1, amend the course or dimensions of the fairway to a minor extent in order to maintain maritime safety or for other important reasons, if the amendment does not infringe public or private interests. The principal shall make a notification of the amendment to the state supervisory authority.

The principal for a public fairway may temporarily amend the fairway if it is necessary to maintain maritime safety or for other important reasons.

Placement of Safety Devices

The principal for a public fairway may, in another's water area, place edge and radar marks, floating safety devices such as buoys and beacons, and other comparable devices that are insignificant in their effects. The principal may likewise, in a water body or on its shore, attach auxiliary devices for maritime safety devices, such as alignment marks for beacons, bolts, posts, and other minor devices. Devices as referred to in this subsection shall be placed so that they do not cause the owner of the area or another right holder significant nuisance.

The permit authority may grant the principal for a public fairway a permit to place other maritime safety devices in a water body or on its shore than those referred to in subsection 1 and to remove obstacles that obscure the safety devices, if an agreement on the matter has not been reached with the owner of the area. In an area that has been taken into special use, a permit may not be granted without a compelling need.

The Finnish Transport Agency has, under the conditions stated in subsections 1 and 2, the right to place safety devices outside a public fairway that are needed to mark shoals or skerries or for a similar reason.

Regarding the construction of safety devices in a public fairway or on the shores of a public fairway, what is specifically prescribed about maritime safety devices shall also apply.

Safety Devices in a Private Fairway

A small safety device that is necessary for maritime safety may be placed in another's water area to mark a private fairway, if the placement does not cause significant nuisance to the owner of the area or to the use of the area in other respects. The owner of the water area shall be notified of the placement in advance. Regarding the marking of private fairways, what is specifically prescribed shall otherwise apply.

(8.9.2017/611)
Right to Another's Water Area in Certain Cases

The permit authority may grant an applicant a right of use or a right of redemption to another's water area for a public loading or anchoring area or a public harbor in connection with a fairway, if:

the project meets the conditions stated in Chapter 3, § 4, subsection 1,

the project secures access to port services or traffic or business activities that are to be considered important or meets some other corresponding public interest, and

the project can be considered to be required by a public need.

The permit authority may grant an applicant a right of use to another's water area for a private anchoring area in connection with a fairway, if the conditions stated in Chapter 3, § 4, subsection 1 are met. A shore owner may be granted a right of use to another's water area for a private loading place or harbor, if the conditions stated in subsection 1 of this section are met.

Certain Rights Necessary for the Duties of the Defence Forces and the Border Guard

The Defence Forces and the Border Guard have the right, for their official duties, to permanently place safety devices as referred to in § 5 in another's area, observing in applicable parts what is prescribed in that section about the rights of the principal in a public fairway. The same applies in applicable parts to bolts and comparable devices needed for temporary anchoring or mooring of vessels. If the device is insignificant, what is prescribed in § 5, subsection 1 about auxiliary devices for a safety device shall apply, except in the case of an area that has been taken into special use.

The permit authority may also, in cases other than those referred to in § 7, subsection 1, grant the Defence Forces or the Border Guard such a right of use or right of redemption for a loading or anchoring area or a harbor that is needed for their duties.

The applicant shall submit to the permit authority a sufficient report on the need for the right or measure that the application concerns.

Compensation for Loss of Benefit

Compensation shall be paid for such loss of benefit that is caused by measures taken in accordance with the provisions of this chapter on another's land or water area or by a right to use or redeem an area belonging to another.

The principal for a fairway is obliged to repair or compensate for a loss of benefit caused by the establishment of a fairway or by the customary use of the fairway, unless it is to be considered reasonable that the damage be tolerated. A decision to establish a fairway shall contain provisions on the repair or compensation for such losses of benefit that can be estimated in advance. The permit authority may also decide that the provisions on the repair or payment of compensation shall be reviewed separately at a time determined in the decision. If the losses of benefit cannot be calculated in advance, the permit authority may oblige the fairway's principal to, within a certain time, initiate an application proceeding for the determination of compensation for the losses of benefit that arise.

On compensation for a loss of benefit that could not have been foreseen, what is prescribed in Chapter 13, § 8, subsection 1 shall also apply.

Fee for the Use of a Fairway

No fee may be collected for the use of a fairway in a water body. The permit authority may, upon application, grant the principal for a private fairway, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications the principal for a public local fairway, the right to collect a fee from those who use the fairway as compensation for the construction costs, if these costs are very high. The decision shall state the amount of the fee and the grounds for the fee, as well as the period for which the right to collect fees is valid.

The owner of a lock or another device belonging to a private fairway has the right to collect a reasonable fee for services in connection with the use of the device. The owner or the person whose right or interest the matter may concern may apply for the permit authority to determine the amount of the fee and the grounds for the fee.

Regarding the collection of fees for the use of public canals and harbors and regarding fairway dues under the Act on Fairway Dues (1122/2005), what is specifically prescribed shall apply, regardless of subsection 1.

The State's Redemption Obligation

When a private fairway or a public local fairway is changed to a public fairway, the state shall redeem the devices belonging to the fairway at their value at the time in question, if the devices are needed for the use of the public fairway.

If the principal for a fairway has otherwise used funds to build or improve the fairway, the state shall pay the principal compensation for these costs to the extent that the costs have not been covered by the collection of fees under § 10 or to the extent that state funds have not been granted for the costs.

Maintenance Obligation

A person who, according to a decision on the establishment of a fairway, has the right to build or improve a fairway is obliged to maintain the fairway and the devices in it, observing in applicable parts Chapter 2, § 9.

Chapter 11
Application Procedure

Scope

The Administrative Procedure Act and the provisions of this chapter apply to the handling of application matters at the permit authority.

If an energy project of common interest under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 requires a permit for construction under Chapter 3, the said Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council and the Act on the Permit Procedure for Energy Projects of Common Interest within the European Union (684/2014) shall be applied to the handling of the permit matter in addition to this Act.

Special Information
Information about the notice shall be given separately to the parties whom the matter particularly concerns.
An unincorporated partnership for a joint property unit may, notwithstanding what is prescribed in § 26 of the Act on Jointly Owned Areas, be served an application by public notice in accordance with § 10. If the matter concerns the partners' rights to other than a minor extent, information about the publication of the notice shall be published in at least one newspaper with general circulation in the area of activity's influence.
(19.6.2019/766)
Hearing on the Permit Application and on the Supplementation of an Environmental Impact Statement
If a permit application and such a supplementation of an environmental impact statement according to § 27 of the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure that concern the same project are pending at the same time, the permit authority may, in connection with a hearing on the permit application, arrange a hearing on the environmental impact statement, observing § 20 of the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure. Opinions and statements on the environmental impact statement, as well as remarks and opinions on the permit application, shall be submitted to the permit authority at least 45 and at most 60 days after a date determined by the permit authority.
Joint Handling of Permit Applications
If a project includes measures that require a permit under both this Act and the Environmental Protection Act, what is prescribed in § 47 of the Environmental Protection Act on the joint handling of permit applications shall apply. (27.6.2014/531)
A permit application under this Act and an application under the Environmental Protection Act concerning the pollution of water and relating to the same activity shall be handled together and decided by the same decision, unless this is to be considered unnecessary for special reasons. Joint handling is not needed, however, if the project, in addition to an environmental permit, only requires a permit under Chapter 4 for the abstraction of water and there is no direct water management connection between the abstraction of water and the discharge of the water back into the water body.
If, during the handling of an application matter under this Act, it appears that the project also requires an environmental permit under the Environmental Protection Act, the permit authority shall oblige the applicant to submit an environmental permit application within a reasonable time. In other cases, the pending permit application may be dismissed without examination.
Joint Processing
If several applications have a close connection, the permit authority may handle the applications at the same time, provided that this is considered appropriate and joint processing does not cause unreasonable delay in the handling of the matter or cause other nuisance.
Inspection
The permit authority or an official employed by the authority may conduct an inspection according to § 39 of the Administrative Procedure Act. The inspection report shall be attached to the documents.
(26.6.2015/803)
Oral Evidence
The permit authority may hear a witness orally under affirmation and a party orally in connection with a site inspection according to § 38 of the Administrative Procedure Act or otherwise when necessary.
When a witness or a party is heard by way of oral evidence, parties affected by the hearing shall be given the opportunity to be present.
Obtaining a Special Report
After service, the permit authority may decide that a special report needed to decide the matter shall be obtained, unless the report can otherwise be obtained without difficulty. When obtaining the report, the parties shall, where necessary, be given the opportunity to be heard.
The report is prepared by a sufficiently expert person who is employed in the environmental administration. If the report is prepared by someone who is not employed by the permit authority, they shall be appointed for the assignment as a rapporteur in a secondary capacity at the permit authority.
The report is formulated as a statement. The statement and other documents shall be sent to the permit authority within three months after the permit authority has announced that a reporting procedure is being initiated. More detailed provisions on the procedure to be observed when a special report is obtained may be issued by Government decree.
Decision-Making
The authority that decides a matter shall examine the statements and remarks in the matter and, in permit matters, the conditions for granting a permit.
In permit matters, a permit is granted for a project that meets the requirements of this Act and of the regulations issued by virtue of it.
It is the person who has applied for a permit or a right who is granted the permit or the right. If an association has been formed to implement a project, the permit or the right shall be granted to the association.
Deciding a Certain Part of a Matter
For special reasons, the permit authority may, in an application matter, issue a decision on a certain substantive issue before the matter is decided in other respects. Compensation shall then be applied according to Chapter 13.
If a detailed report on the losses of benefits that the project causes unreasonably delays the decision of the matter and if it is obvious that there are conditions for implementing the project, the matter may be decided to the extent that it does not concern compensation for these losses. Compensation for the redemption of property or the granting of a right of use shall, however, be determined in connection with the permit being granted.
For special reasons, the permit authority may decide that the question of compensation for a damage caused by a certain measure referred to in the application shall be decided later. When the permit authority decides the matter, it shall oblige the project proponent to obtain the report needed for deciding the compensation issue and to, within a set time, initiate an application for supplementing the compensation decision. A decision that the compensation issue is to be decided separately does not prevent the injured party from applying for compensation in accordance with this Act.
Amendment of a Previous Decision
When the permit authority later issues its decision in the matter to the extent that it has not yet been decided, the authority may amend its previous decision only to the extent that it is necessary to remove contradictory or clearly inappropriate conditions.
If the permit authority has received new information about the grounds for a fishery conservation obligation or a fishery management fee imposed by a decision under § 18, subsection 2, the authority may, ex officio, handle a matter concerning the adjustment and supplementation of the obligation or fee. The permit decision may in this case be reviewed so that it corresponds to Chapter 3, § 14, regardless of what this Act otherwise says about the review of permit conditions.
Security
If an applicant other than the state, a municipality, or a joint municipal authority is granted a permit in accordance with § 18, subsection 2, the applicant shall provide acceptable security to compensate for the losses of benefits that the activity causes. Regarding the provision of security, the applicable parts of Chapter 3, § 17, subsection 1 shall apply.
The security is lodged with the regional state administrative agency, which shall monitor the interests of the compensation recipient when the security is provided and which, where necessary, shall take measures to realize the security or distribute the funds. The amount of the security shall be adjusted where necessary.
The security shall be released when the compensation obligation has been fulfilled, or when the compensation decision has gained legal force and the activity has not been initiated before that. If it is determined that the compensation shall be paid periodically, the security shall, however, be released when the compensation decision gains legal force, provided that all installments due up to that point have been paid or have been deposited with the support of another provision. The permit authority's decision to release a security may not be appealed.
(5.5.2017/257)
Content of the Decision
In the decision, the purpose of the application shall be explained or the parts of the application that are necessary shall be attached to the decision. The decision shall present the necessary provisions under Chapter 3, §§ 10–14 that concern the project, as well as other provisions on the implementation of the project. The decision shall address specified demands that have been made in statements and remarks. If the project causes such a loss of benefit that is to be compensated, the decision shall contain provisions on the compensation in accordance with what is prescribed in Chapter 13.
If the application concerns a project under the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure, the decision shall include the reasoned conclusion of the contact authority and a summary of the results of the hearings under §§ 20 and 29 of that Act. The decision shall show how the environmental impact statement, the reasoned conclusion, and any such documents concerning an international hearing on transboundary impacts as are referred to in § 29 of the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure have been taken into account.
The permit decision shall also show how the management plan and the marine management plan referred to in the Act on the Organisation of Water Resources and Marine Management, as well as the flood risk management plan referred to in the Act on Flood Risk Management, have been taken into account.
(12.4.2019/505)
Service of and Information about a Decision
The permit authority shall serve a decision on an application matter by public notice in compliance with § 62 a of the Administrative Procedure Act.
The decision shall be sent to the applicant. A copy of the decision shall be sent to those who have requested it, to the supervisory authorities, and to the authorities that protect public interests in the matter. Information about the issuance of the decision shall be sent electronically to a known address to the parties referred to in § 11, to the authorities referred to in § 9, and to those who have made remarks and expressed opinions in the matter.
Information about the notice shall be published in the municipalities within the project's area of influence in compliance with § 108 of the Local Government Act. Information that the notice is being made public shall be published in at least one newspaper with general circulation in the project's area of influence, unless the matter is of minor significance or it is otherwise unnecessary to publish the information.
Compensation for Interest Protection Costs
The parties are responsible for their own costs at the permit authority.
A party has the right to compensation for their costs if the party has been forced to take special measures to prove that the project causes them such a loss of benefit that is to be compensated or if there are otherwise special reasons to compensate the costs.
If, upon the application of the person who has suffered damage, it is determined that the person who caused the damage shall pay compensation or take some measure, the permit authority may oblige the person who caused the damage to compensate the injured party for the costs incurred in connection with the matter being investigated. If a party has been granted legal aid under the Legal Aid Act (257/2002), the permit authority shall, in connection with deciding the compensation matter, determine the counsel's fee and the legal aid recipient's own contribution and oblige the legal aid recipient to pay this own contribution to their counsel in accordance with what is prescribed in that Act.
Handling of Matters at the Municipal Environmental Protection Authority
On the handling of a matter at the municipal environmental protection authority, what is prescribed in §§ 1–11, 13, 14, 17, and 21–23 about the handling of matters at the permit authority shall apply.
(19.6.2019/766)
Application of the Act on the Coordination of Certain Environment-Related Permit Procedures
If the Act on the Coordination of Certain Environment-Related Permit Procedures (764/2019) is applied to the handling of a permit application, §§ 11, 14, and 15 of that Act shall be applied instead of §§ 10 and 22 of this Act.
Chapter 12
Water-Law Association
Water-Law Association
A water-law association as referred to in this chapter may be formed for the following joint water management projects:
drainage according to Chapter 5,
permanent change of the mean water level according to Chapter 6,
water regulation according to Chapter 7,
timber floating according to Chapter 9,
such restoration of a water body that requires measures under this Act or a water management project that is implemented for other corresponding purposes.
On water-law associations, what is prescribed elsewhere in this Act shall also apply.
The initiative to form a water-law association may be taken by anyone who can become a member of the association.
Membership in the Association and Membership List
Members of a water-law association are the owners of the properties that benefit from a project as referred to in § 1, the users of constructions belonging to the project, and other beneficiaries. Members of the association are also other parties in accordance with what is prescribed elsewhere in this Act.
The association's board or representative shall keep a list of the association's members to organize the association's activities. The members' identification and contact details shall be recorded in the list. Information about a member shall be removed from the list five years after the membership has ceased. Provisions on the processing of personal data are in the Personal Data Act (523/1999).
Personal Data Act 523/1999 has been repealed by the Data Protection Act 1050/2018.
Constituent Meeting
Before forming a water-law association, the initiator shall summon all known beneficiaries and other potential members to a constituent meeting. The constituent meeting may continue at the time the meeting decides, without a new notice being sent out. At the constituent meeting, bylaws for the association shall be adopted and one or more representatives or a board shall be appointed. At the constituent meeting, each member has one vote.
The notice of the constituent meeting shall be announced in at least one newspaper with general circulation in the locality and in a letter of notice sent to the known members. A notice may be given to an unincorporated partnership for a joint property unit in accordance with what is stated in § 26, subsection 3 of the Act on Jointly Owned Areas or by sending a letter of notice to the known partners. The notice has been duly served when the letters have been posted and the announcement has been published at least 14 days before the meeting.
Bylaws
The bylaws of a water-law association shall state the following information:
the name of the association and the municipality that is the association's domicile,
the purpose of the association,
how the members' voting rights at the association's meeting are calculated,
how many representatives or board members are appointed at the association's annual ordinary meeting and, where applicable, the number of deputies,
in what way the chairman and vice-chairman of the board are elected, how long their term of office is, and in what way their fees are determined,

when the association's ordinary meeting is to be held,
when and how the notice of the association's meeting and other notices are to be sent to the members,
the grounds for the distribution of the costs to be collected from the members,
how the activities are to be financed.
Establishment of the Bylaws
The bylaws of a water-law association are established by the permit authority, unless otherwise follows from Chapter 5, § 24. The bylaws shall be established if they are in accordance with the law and do not cause damage to any member. Minor amendments may be made to the bylaws if it is needed for the bylaws to be established.
The affairs of the association shall be managed according to the adopted bylaws even before the bylaws are established. The established bylaws shall be followed even if the establishment decision has not gained legal force.
When the bylaws are amended, the procedure regulated in subsection 1 shall be followed.
Register of Water-Law Associations
The water-law associations are entered in a register of water-law associations. The register is part of the environmental information system. The register is kept by the Ministry of the Environment.
The following information shall be entered in the register of water-law associations:
basic information about the association,
the association's bylaws,
information about the association's board and representatives.
The personal data about a water-law association are deleted from the register five years after the association has been dissolved.
More detailed provisions on the information to be entered in the register of water-law associations may be issued by Government decree.
Legal Effects of Registration
A registered water-law association sues and is sued in matters concerning the association's project. The association may acquire rights and enter into commitments in its own name for the purpose of carrying out the tasks that the association has under this Act.
Registration of an Association
An association that has been formed is entered in the register of water-law associations by the permit authority. If the association has been formed and its bylaws have been established at a drainage proceeding, the state supervisory authority that has decided that a drainage proceeding is to be held is responsible for the information being entered in the register.
Entry of Information
A water-law association shall notify the state supervisory authority of changes in the information referred to in § 6, subsection 2. The authority enters the changes in the register of water-law associations.
Entries that are based on a decision issued by the Vaasa Administrative Court or the Supreme Administrative Court are entered in the register of water-law associations by the state supervisory authority.
Right to Obtain Information
The register of water-law associations is public. Everyone has the right, in accordance with what is prescribed in the Act on the Openness of Government Activities (621/1999), to obtain information from the register and the documents that the register contains.
The permit authority, the state supervisory authority, and the municipal environmental protection authority have the right to, free of charge, obtain such information from the register as they need to perform their duties under this Act.
Meeting of the Association
A water-law association's decision-making power is exercised by the association's meeting. The meeting makes its decisions by a simple majority.
The association's ordinary meeting shall be held at the times determined in the bylaws. If a meeting has not been convened, every member has the right to demand that such a meeting be held.
The association shall hold an extraordinary meeting if members who together represent at least one-tenth of the total number of votes in the association demand it in writing for the handling of a specified matter.
If the association has ceased its activities, a member of the association or the supervisory authority may call a meeting to decide on the appointment of a board or one or more representatives to handle the association's obligations.
Matters to be Decided at the Association's Meeting
The meeting shall decide on:
the initiation and termination of membership,
the acquisition, transfer, and mortgaging of real property and the transfer of other property that is important for the association's activities,
the determination of fees that the members are to pay,
the election or dismissal of representatives, board members, and auditors,
the adoption of the financial statements and the granting of discharge from liability,
the amendment of the association's bylaws, and
the dissolution of the association.
The board or a representative may, regardless of what is prescribed in subsection 1, by virtue of a provision in the association's bylaws, decide on the sale, exchange, and mortgaging of the association's property.
Board and Representatives
The association shall have either a board or one or more representatives. The board shall have a chairman. A person who is legally incompetent or has been declared bankrupt may not be a board member or a representative.
The board and the representatives have the task of handling the preparation and execution of the association's decisions and other practical activities. They shall manage the association's administration with care and equally take into account the interests that the members of the association have.
The board and the representatives shall represent the association in court and also otherwise represent the association. A summons or another notice is considered to have come to the association's knowledge when the notice has been served in the prescribed manner on any of the association's board members or representatives.
Quorum and Decision-Making of the Board
Unless otherwise determined in the association's bylaws, the board has a quorum when more than half of the total number of board members are present.
The board's decision is the opinion that the majority of the votes have supported. The bylaws may, however, stipulate that a decision shall be made by a qualified majority or unanimously. If the votes are equal, the opinion that the chairman supports shall apply. If it is a matter of an election and the votes are equal, the election shall be decided by lot.
Bookkeeping
Documents relating to an association's income and expenditure, as well as the association's vouchers and its correspondence on business transactions, shall be kept for at least six years from the end of the year when the financial period ended. The accounting material shall be arranged so that the connection between vouchers and accounting entries can be established without difficulty.
If the association, according to the Accounting Act (1336/1997), is obliged to keep books for a business or profession, the bookkeeping shall be arranged in the manner prescribed in that Act.
A member has the right to inspect the association's bookkeeping and other documents relating to the association's activities. A member also has the right to use assistants and to receive copies of the bookkeeping and other documents. The association has the right to receive compensation from the member for what it costs the association to copy and send the documents.
Liability for Damages
The association's board members, representatives, and auditors are obliged to compensate for damages that they, intentionally or through negligence in their activities, have caused to the association. The same applies to damage caused to a member of the association through a violation of the provisions of this Act or the association's bylaws.
Provisions on the mitigation of damages and on the distribution of liability for damages between two or more persons liable for damages are in the Damages Act (412/1974).
Compensation for damage caused to the association or its member shall be claimed by an action brought in the district court.
Challengeable Decisions
A member may challenge a decision made by the association's meeting, board, or representative if the decision has not been made in the prescribed manner, if it is contrary to the law or the association's bylaws, or if it infringes the member's rights.
A matter as referred to in subsection 1 shall be initiated by an application to the permit authority within 60 days after the decision was made. If a request for rectification under § 18 has been made regarding the decision, the member has the right to initiate the matter within 30 days of receiving the decision made on the request for rectification.
The permit authority may, for special reasons, consent to the decision being enforced before the matter is finally decided, if the enforcement does not make it meaningless to seek amendment.
Request for Rectification
A member whose rights are affected by a decision made by the association's meeting, board, or representative may, regardless of § 17, request a rectification of the decision at the association's meeting. The request for rectification may be made on the grounds that the decision has not been made in the prescribed manner, that it is contrary to the law or the association's bylaws, or that it infringes the member's rights. If an establishment for the decision is to be sought from the permit authority, a request for rectification may not be made.
A request for rectification shall be made within 21 days from the date the decision was made. Within 30 days from the date the request for rectification was made, the association's board or representative shall convene the association's meeting to handle the request for rectification or decide that the request for rectification will not be brought to the association's meeting for handling. The board or a representative also has the right to, within the said time, decide on a request for rectification themselves if it is a decision that the board or the representative has made themselves.
Dissolution of an Association
An association cannot be dissolved if it has obligations or responsibilities that are based on a permit or a right granted for a water management project. An association that is a permit holder in a project as referred to in Chapter 3, § 19 may be dissolved if the permit authority has given permission for the project to be discontinued.
When an association has decided to dissolve itself, the association's board or representatives shall take the liquidation measures that the dissolution requires, unless the association has appointed one or more other liquidators for the task. An association that has decided to dissolve itself may continue with economic activities to the extent that an appropriate liquidation requires.
An association that has decided to dissolve itself shall pay its debts and fulfill the obligations that the permit authority has imposed on the association. If all the association's creditors are not known, the association shall issue a public summons to the unknown creditors. If the association's assets are greater than its debts and nothing else follows from the legal relations between the members of the association, the surplus shall be distributed among the members in proportion to their voting rights.
The person responsible for the liquidation measures according to subsection 2 or any of the members of the association shall notify the permit authority that the association has been dissolved within 45 days after the liquidation measures have been completed. The notice shall be accompanied by a final report showing that the obligations referred to in subsection 3 have been fulfilled. The permit authority shall examine the notice. If the liquidation measures upon the dissolution of the association have been taken as prescribed in subsection 3, the permit authority shall confirm that the association has been dissolved and register this in the environmental information system.
Chapter 13
Compensations
(8.9.2017/611)
Legally Caused Loss of Benefit
The project proponent is obliged, as prescribed in this chapter, to compensate for a loss of benefit resulting from a measure that has been or will be taken under this Act or a permit granted under this Act, if the loss of benefit is caused by:
a water management project implemented under a permit,
a right to use or redeem property belonging to another,
a measure that under Chapter 3, § 2 requires a permit, but for which a permit was not sought because the measure could not have been presumed to have such consequences as are referred to in that section,
measures as referred to in Chapter 2, §§ 5, 5a, and 6, Chapter 5, § 9, Chapter 10, § 9, and Chapter 18, § 5, or cases as referred to in Chapter 9, § 8, subsection 1.
Joint and Several Liability
If there are several project proponents, they are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation under this chapter. If any of the jointly and severally liable parties has paid more than their share of the compensation, they have the right to claim the excess amount from the other jointly and severally liable parties.
If any of the jointly and severally liable parties is clearly insolvent, their whereabouts are unknown, or they do not pay their share within one month after being required to do so by someone who has paid more than their own share of the compensation, the other jointly and severally liable parties are responsible for this share.
Loss of Benefit in Certain Special Cases
Loss of benefit resulting from a malfunction in a water pipeline, a sewer or any other such pipeline, a ditch, or a device or structure referred to in this Act that has been erected or is under construction in a water body or on its shore shall be compensated as prescribed in § 1, provided that the malfunction does not have an exceptional external cause.
The owner and the possessor of the structure or device referred to in subsection 1 are jointly and severally liable for compensating the loss of benefit, regardless of fault. However, any loss of benefit other than that which has directly affected property shall be compensated only if the owner or the possessor of the structure or device has acted intentionally or negligently.
Damage caused by the collapse of a structure or other unforeseen damage shall be compensated according to § 1, regardless of whether the permit decision has gained legal force.
If the loss of benefit referred to in subsection 1 results from an environmental damage as defined in the Act on Compensation for Environmental Damage (737/1994), hereinafter the Environmental Damage Act, that Act shall apply to the compensation for the loss of benefit.
Loss of Benefit as a Result of Navigation in a Water Body
Unless otherwise follows from the Maritime Act (674/1994), the owner of a vessel is liable for compensation for loss of benefit resulting from navigation in a water body, if the loss was caused by intentional or negligent conduct. The compensation shall be determined as prescribed in this chapter. The Maritime Act shall apply to the limitation of shipowners' liability and maritime liens.
Loss of benefit caused by an object unlawfully placed in a king's vein or public fairway shall not be compensated. The same applies to fishing gear in a water body, unless the loss of benefit was caused intentionally or by gross negligence.
If the poor condition or inadequate maintenance of the damaged property contributed to the occurrence of the loss of benefit, this shall be taken into account when the compensation is determined.
Loss of Benefit Caused by an Unlawful Measure
The Damages Act shall apply to compensation for loss of benefit resulting from a measure that is contrary to this Act, to provisions issued by virtue of it, or to conditions, stipulations, orders, prohibitions, or ordinances issued by virtue of it, and to compensation for personal injury resulting from a measure under this Act. The Environmental Damage Act shall apply to compensation for environmental damage.
Authorities and Courts Handling Compensation Matters
Matters referred to in this chapter concerning compensation for loss of benefit shall be decided by the permit authority, unless otherwise follows from subsections 2 and 3.
Compensation for loss of benefit resulting from a matter to be handled at a drainage proceeding shall be decided at the proceeding. The municipal environmental protection authority shall handle compensation matters related to a right it has granted and compensation matters related to matters as referred to in Chapter 5, § 5, unless otherwise follows from subsection 3 of this section.
The District Court shall handle:
matters concerning compensation for personal injury,
matters as referred to in § 3, subsection 1, unless the matter is to be handled by the permit authority under § 130 of the Environmental Protection Act,
matters as referred to in § 4, unless otherwise follows from the Maritime Act, and
matters as referred to in § 5, unless otherwise follows from § 7, subsection 2 or an administrative enforcement procedure as referred to in Chapter 14, § 4 has been initiated.
(19.12.2017/975)
Compensations in Connection with Application Matters
When an authority grants a permit or a right under this Act, it shall, ex officio, determine that losses of benefits resulting from the project shall be compensated, unless otherwise follows from Chapter 11, § 18.
When the authority decides a matter as referred to in subsection 1, it may also handle a claim for compensation for such a loss of benefit caused in the same activity before the permit matter was decided or as referred to in § 1, point 3.
The authority shall handle the claim referred to in subsection 2, unless this causes significant delay. If the claim cannot be handled in connection with the permit matter, compensation shall be claimed through a separate application to the permit authority. A decision on the separate handling of a compensation claim may not be appealed.
Separate Compensation Matters
Regardless of a prior decision, compensation for such losses of benefits that were not foreseen when the permit was granted may be claimed by application to the permit authority. If the loss of benefit is due to a matter handled at a drainage proceeding or by the municipal environmental protection authority, the matter shall be decided by the municipal environmental protection authority.
By separate application, compensation shall also be claimed for:
loss of benefit resulting from a measure that does not require a permit under this Act,
loss of benefit as referred to in § 3, subsection 1, when the matter is not to be handled by the District Court, and
loss of benefit as referred to in § 7, subsection 2, if the compensation claim cannot be handled in connection with the permit matter.
A matter as referred to in subsection 1 shall be initiated within ten years from when the notification of completion was made, unless a longer period has been specified in the permit. If the construction work has not been completed before the notification of completion, the period shall be calculated from when the construction work was completed. However, compensation may be sought regardless of the time limit for damage caused by the collapse of a structure and for other unforeseen damage.
Losses of Benefits to be Compensated
Unless otherwise prescribed elsewhere in this Act, the following shall be compensated as a loss of benefit as referred to in § 1:
loss of benefit resulting from a right of use or a right to redeem real or movable property that has been granted under this Act,
loss, damage to, or deterioration of real or movable property or a part thereof for a reason other than that mentioned in point 1, hindrance to or impairment of the possibilities to use the property, reduction of its yield, reduction in the value of the property due to the aforementioned circumstances, and loss of any other such benefit with property value that is based on the ownership right, including costs for moving property and converting it into property of another kind,
such reduction in the use value or the value of real or movable property, and such costs for moving or rebuilding a building or property of another kind, as are caused by a loss of benefit referred to in subsection 1 or 2 with respect to other property with the same owner,
loss of a servitude or right of use, right of use to hydropower, fishing right or other comparable special right, loss or impairment of the possibilities to exercise such a right, and loss of any other benefit with property value based on such a right; if a right referred to here is based on a lease, the loss shall be compensated only to the extent that the lessee is not entitled to a reduction of the lease payment under § 21,
loss that has occurred because a building or other structure, device, or material has become partially or wholly useless due to such a loss of benefit as is referred to in point 4,
loss or significant impairment for those who use the benefit in question of necessary access to water or of any other such important possibility to use a water area or its shore that is not based on an ownership right or a special right as referred to in point 4,
loss or impairment of the possibilities to conduct reindeer husbandry or professional fishing, also in cases other than those mentioned above, and
interruption in the operation of a business on the property that is the subject of the measure, and costs for moving from the property.
If a loss of benefit to be compensated under subsection 1 is caused by noise, vibration, radiation, light, heat, odor, or other similar disturbance, § 12 of the Environmental Damage Act shall apply.
The owner of an area is not entitled to compensation for water taken from the area. However, such impaired access to water that is caused by water abstraction and affects the owner or the person who uses the groundwater by virtue of another special right is considered a loss of benefit to be compensated, unless the impairment is minor. When determining compensation for a right of use, the increase in the value of the land resulting from the possibility of abstracting groundwater shall also be taken into account.
Hindrance to or Impairment of the Public Right to Use a Water Body
A loss or impairment of the possibilities for navigation or floating in a water body in accordance with what is prescribed in this Act about the public right to use a water body is not considered such a loss of benefit to be compensated under § 9, unless otherwise follows from § 9, subsection 1, point 6 or 7.
Amount of Compensation
The compensation for a loss of benefit as referred to in § 9, subsection 1, points 1–5 shall be determined at the full amount, unless otherwise follows from subsection 4 or § 12. Compensation for the transfer of real property or a part of such property or for the granting of a right of use to real property shall be determined in accordance with the Act on the Redemption of Real Property and Special Rights (603/1977), unless otherwise prescribed in this Act.
If the measure that caused the loss of benefit brings immediate benefit to property belonging to the person entitled to compensation, and the compensation recipient is not obliged to participate in the costs of the project on that basis, the benefit received by the compensation recipient shall be reasonably adjusted and taken into account when the compensation is determined.
For a loss of benefit according to § 9, subsection 1, points 6–8, compensation shall be determined according to the circumstances, also taking into account the benefit that the project immediately brings to the person entitled to compensation, if they are not to participate in the costs of the project.
When a right is granted whereby a land area belonging to another may be redeemed, taken into permanent use, or changed to a water area, the loss of benefit concerning the land and the existing buildings, structures, and devices thereon shall be compensated at one and a half times its value. A right of use to hydropower or a loss of hydropower shall also be compensated at one and a half times its value. However, a loss of benefit resulting from the right to use or redeem an area needed for a ditch, water pipeline, water intake, or sewer shall be compensated as prescribed in subsection 1.
Redemption Obligation
When land belonging to another is permanently submerged through a measure based on this Act, or another significant permanent nuisance is caused to the use of another's property or an area belonging thereto, it may be determined at the owner's request that the property, the joint property unit, or a part thereof shall be redeemed. If a part of such an area is redeemed or if the owner loses the possibility of using that part and this causes a significant permanent nuisance to the use of the remaining part, it shall be determined at the owner's request that the area affected by the nuisance shall be redeemed.
In the same way, it may be determined at the owner's request that real or movable property which becomes useless and for which the owner has the right to claim compensation under § 9, subsection 1, point 3 or 5, shall be redeemed if it cannot be considered reasonable for the owner to be satisfied with compensation for the loss of benefit.
The compensation paid under this section shall be one and a half times the value when the property is of the kind referred to in § 11, subsection 4.
Agreement on Compensation
The parties may agree on the payment of compensation, its amount, and other circumstances concerning the compensation. The agreement shall be made in writing.
If the agreement concerns mortgaged real property or property that is subject to a business mortgage, the consent of the right holder to the agreement must be obtained.
Prevention or Reduction of Loss of Benefit through Special Measures
The party liable for compensation shall, if deemed reasonable, instead of paying compensation, be obliged to take, at their own expense, the measures needed to prevent or reduce the loss of benefit that is to be compensated under this Act, if the costs of these measures do not unreasonably exceed the amount of the compensation to be paid for the loss of benefit.
Securing the Supply of Water
If a water management project requiring a permit prevents or significantly complicates the abstraction of water, the permit authority shall, at the request of the person entitled to compensation, determine that the party liable for compensation shall, instead of paying compensation, take the necessary measures to secure the supply of water.
The person entitled to compensation is responsible for the maintenance of devices and structures erected under subsection 1, unless the permit authority, taking the circumstances into account, determines otherwise.
If the loss of benefit under subsection 1 is due to a water intake being constructed or used, the permit authority may, instead of compensation, grant the person entitled to compensation the right to receive from the water intake a quantity of water not exceeding their previous consumption. This must not cause unreasonable costs nor jeopardize the intended use of the water intake. The right applies as long as the water intake is in use. For the water the right holder receives, they shall pay a price corresponding to the water's share of the water intake's operating costs. The party liable for compensation is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the necessary water pipeline.
If the benefit of a measure as referred to in this section is greater than the loss of benefit as referred to in subsection 1, the permit authority may, when it decides on the measure, oblige the person who has the right to compensation to, as deemed reasonable, contribute to the costs of the measure with at most a share that corresponds to the benefit that the measure brings them.
Payment of Compensation
A decision on liability for compensation shall state when and how the compensation is to be paid and that established compensation is to be paid as a lump sum, unless special reasons require that the compensation be paid periodically. At the request of the compensation recipient, it may be determined that a security approved by the permit authority shall be provided for compensation that is paid periodically.
The decision shall state when it is permissible to take such measures based on the decision for which compensation is to be paid.
It shall be determined that a lump-sum compensation shall be paid or duly deposited with the regional state administrative agency within a period determined by the permit authority and before the measure entailing liability for compensation is taken, unless the parties agree otherwise or something else follows from Chapter 3, § 17 or Chapter 11, § 18, subsection 2. The compensation shall, however, be paid no later than one year after the decision has gained legal force. The compensation shall be paid within 30 days of the decision on compensation being issued in situations under § 1, point 3 and in cases referred to in Chapter 11, § 18, subsection 2, if the activity referred to in the permit has been initiated.
It shall be stated that compensation for a loss of benefit as referred to in § 8, subsections 1 and 2 shall be paid within 30 days from the day the decision gained legal force. For compensations that are to be paid periodically, the 30-day time limit applies only to the payment installments relating to the period before the compensation decision.
Interest to be Paid on Compensation
When compensation for a loss of benefit as referred to in § 8, subsections 1 and 2 is determined, it shall at the same time be stated that six percent annual interest shall be paid from the day the compensation claim was made to the authority or the handling of the compensation issue otherwise became pending up to and including the due date.
If a measure that gives rise to liability for compensation may be taken before the compensation is determined, paid, or deposited, or if it has already been taken in the manner referred to in § 1, point 3, it shall be stated that six percent annual interest shall be paid on the compensation from the day the measure was taken up to and including the due date.
For compensations to be paid periodically, subsections 1 and 2 apply, however, only to the payment installments relating to the period before the compensation decision.
It shall be stated ex officio that default interest according to the Interest Act shall be paid on the compensation for the period after the due date.
Repayment of Compensation
If compensation has been paid without grounds or in an excessive amount, the payer has the right to claim repayment through an application to the permit authority. The permit authority or the appellate authority may, taking into account the amount of the compensation and the circumstances, decide that the compensation need not be repaid.
Compensation to be Paid for Mortgaged Property
If it is determined that a lump-sum compensation is to be paid for the transfer of a property or an area belonging to a property, for a right of use to real property, or for any measure that otherwise under this Act relates to real property in which a mortgage has been established, the permit authority shall at the same time order that the compensation, after the decision has gained legal force, shall be deposited with the regional state administrative agency and distributed as prescribed for the purchase price of seized property. The holder of a lien has the same right to the deposited compensation amount as they had to the pledged property.
It shall not be ordered that the compensation be deposited if the holder of the lien consents to the compensation not being deposited. Nor shall it be ordered that the compensation be deposited if the value of the security has not significantly decreased because the loss of benefit to be compensated is minor or for some other similar reason.
If the compensation for loss of benefit concerns mortgaged real property and is caused by a measure that benefits another property belonging to the same owner or a project that is independent in nature, a compensation corresponding to the loss of benefit shall be determined in connection with the granting of the permit for the measure, and it shall be determined that the compensation be deposited in accordance with subsections 1 and 2.
Compensation as a Benefit Belonging to the Property
If compensation to be paid periodically has been determined for a loss of benefit caused to real property or a facility in which a mortgage can be granted, the compensation is a benefit that belongs to the property and cannot be detached from it.
Reduction of Lease Payment
If a lessee of an area loses possession of or the possibility to use a part of the leased area as a result of a measure referred to in this Act, the lessee is entitled to a reduction of the lease payment corresponding to the loss. Matters concerning the reduction of a lease payment are handled by the district court.
Annulment of Liability for Compensation
If the permit holder is to pay compensation under § 16, subsection 3 or a part of the compensation before the measure is taken, and the permit holder then declares that they are refraining from a project that has not been initiated, the permit authority may, when it decides that the permit is no longer valid, upon the application of the permit holder, annul the liability for compensation imposed in the permit.

If the benefit of a measure as referred to in this section is greater than the loss of benefit as referred to in subsection 1, the permit authority may, when it decides on the measure, oblige the person who has the right to compensation to, as deemed reasonable, contribute to the costs of the measure with at most a share that corresponds to the benefit that the measure brings them.

Chapter 14
Supervision and Administrative Enforcement

Supervisory Authorities

The state supervisory authority and the municipal environmental protection authority shall supervise compliance with this Act and the provisions and regulations issued by virtue of it.

More detailed provisions on the procedures in connection with the supervision of compliance with the Act and the organization of supervision may be issued by a decree of the Ministry of the Environment.

Authority Measures in Unlawful Procedures

If this Act or any conditions, provisions, orders, prohibitions, or ordinances issued by virtue of this Act have not been complied with, the supervisory authority shall, taking into account the nature of the matter:

urge the person who is in breach of the conditions, provisions, orders, prohibitions, or ordinances to cease the procedure,

initiate an administrative enforcement matter at the permit authority as referred to in § 4,

report the matter to the police for preliminary investigation, unless the act, considering the circumstances, is to be regarded as minor.

Right to Obtain Information and Conduct Inspections

The supervisory authority or an official or office-holder appointed by it has the right, for supervisory purposes, to:

notwithstanding the duty of confidentiality under the Act on the Openness of Government Activities, obtain necessary information from authorities and operators,

move on another's property,

conduct inspections and investigations, carry out measurements, and take samples,

gain access to places where activities are conducted,

monitor the consequences of an activity.

The right referred to in subsection 1 is also held by persons assisting the supervisory authority in its task.

The supervisory authority may take the measures referred to in subsection 1 in spaces protected by domestic peace only if it is necessary to protect life, health, property, or the environment, or if the supervisory authority has a justified reason to suspect a crime under Chapter 16, § 1.

Measures in Case of Violations or Negligence

If someone violates this Act or any conditions, provisions, orders, prohibitions, or ordinances issued by virtue of it, the permit authority may:

prohibit them from continuing or repeating the violation,

oblige them to fulfill their obligation,

oblige them to rectify what has been done in violation of the conditions, provisions, orders, prohibitions, or ordinances.

If someone, during drainage or the use of a ditch, has acted contrary to the provisions of this Act or provisions issued by virtue of them, or has neglected the maintenance of a ditch, the municipal environmental protection authority may issue a prohibition or an order according to subsection 1. In the event that, when a prohibition or order is issued, it becomes necessary to determine whether a permit from the permit authority is needed or whether a permit is being complied with, it is, however, the permit authority that shall issue the prohibition or order. If it becomes apparent during the handling of a matter that it concerns a project requiring a permit or the compliance with a permit, the matter shall be transferred to the permit authority for a decision.

A prohibition or order may also be issued to the new owner or possessor of a property, even if they are not personally responsible for the unlawful situation that has arisen.

Procedure in Administrative Enforcement Matters

Before a prohibition or order is issued, the person to whom the prohibition or order applies shall be given the opportunity to be heard. Where necessary, other parties, supervisory authorities, and authorities that protect the public interest shall also be heard.

In the handling of such administrative enforcement matters as are referred to in § 4, the applicable parts of what is prescribed in this Act on the handling of application matters shall be observed. The decision shall be served on the person to whom the prohibition or order is issued by verifiable service in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.

Regarding compensation to a party for the costs that the handling of a matter has caused the party, the applicable parts of the Act on Court Proceedings in Administrative Matters (808/2019) shall apply. (5.7.2019/822)

Remedying of Damage to Nature

If a measure in connection with damming or water abstraction that is contrary to this Act or if a neglect of duties causes or entails an imminent threat of a significant negative change in a water body or groundwater or a damage to nature as referred to in Chapter 3, § 7 of the Nature Conservation Act, the permit authority shall, in addition to what is prescribed in § 4 of this chapter, oblige the person who caused the nuisance to take the necessary measures to prevent negative consequences or to limit them to be as minor as possible, or to take remedial measures as referred to in the Act on the Remedying of Certain Environmental Damages (383/2009). The matter shall be handled in the manner prescribed in § 5 of this chapter. (5.1.2023/34)

The provisions in subsection 1 also apply to damage to nature caused intentionally or through negligence by measures other than those mentioned in subsection 1 that are contrary to this Act or to provisions and regulations issued by virtue of it, or through negligence.

When assessing how significant the negative change in a water body and groundwater referred to in subsection 1 is, consideration shall be given, among other things, to the circumstances concerning the water status and water use within the project's area of influence as stated in the management plan referred to in the Act on the Organisation of Water Resources and Marine Management.

More detailed provisions on the assessment of how significant a negative change is and on the circumstances to be taken into account in the assessment shall be issued by Government decree.

Notification of Damage to Nature

The person who has caused nuisance or damage as referred to in § 6, or an imminent threat thereof, shall without delay notify the state supervisory authority of this and take the necessary measures to prevent the nuisance or damage or to limit them to be as minor as possible.

Penalty Payment and Threat of Coercive Measures or Interruption

Authorities shall, unless it is clearly unnecessary, combine a prohibition or order issued under § 4 or § 6 with a penalty payment or with a threat that the neglected measure will be carried out at the expense of the negligent party or that the activity will be interrupted. The supervisory authority may be granted the right to carry out the necessary measure.

In a matter concerning a penalty payment or a threat of coercive measures or interruption, the Act on Conditional Fines (1113/1990) shall apply, unless otherwise follows from this Act. Regarding the payment of the municipal environmental protection authority's costs when it has been granted the right to coercive measures, § 17 of the Act on Conditional Fines shall apply in the same way as in a matter where a decision on coercive measures has been made by a municipal authority.

Structures without an Owner

If the maintenance of a structure as referred to in Chapter 2, § 9, subsection 1 is neglected and it is not known or cannot be ascertained without difficulty who the owner of the structure is or who is otherwise responsible for it, the permit authority may, upon application, grant a supervisory authority the right to take, at the state's expense, the necessary measures to remove the nuisance or danger. The permit authority may, upon application by a supervisory authority, decide that the costs incurred by the state for the measures shall be collected in whole or in part from the person who neglected the maintenance, if it later becomes clear who that person is.

Regarding the handling of a matter concerning the removal of a nuisance or danger, the applicable parts of what is prescribed in Chapter 11 shall apply. Regarding the enforcement of a decision, Chapter 15, § 8 shall apply.

The Supervisory Authority's Immediate Measures

If a measure or neglect in violation of this Act or in violation of conditions, provisions, orders, prohibitions, or ordinances issued by virtue of it may cause immediate nuisance or danger to safety, health, or any other important public interest, or significant danger to another's property, the supervisory authority may take the necessary measures to remove the nuisance or danger.

The supervisory authority shall, after a measure as referred to in subsection 1, without delay initiate such a matter of administrative enforcement as is referred to in § 4, subsection 1, unless this is unnecessary.

Interruption of Activities

The supervisory authority may interrupt an activity as referred to in Chapter 2, § 15 if the activity is clearly unlawful. After the interruption, the supervisory authority shall without delay initiate such a matter of administrative enforcement as is referred to in § 4, subsection 1, unless this is unnecessary.

The supervisory authority may decide that an official or office-holder in its service shall issue the order referred to in subsection 1.

Official Assistance

The police are obliged to provide official assistance to ensure compliance with this Act and the conditions, provisions, orders, prohibitions, and ordinances issued by virtue of it. The same obligation is held by the customs and border guard authorities, each within its area of competence.

Measures Following a Notification of Completion

The state supervisory authority shall, by public notice in compliance with § 62 a of the Administrative Procedure Act, serve the notification of completion that has been submitted to it, if the project in question has significant or far-reaching environmental consequences. Information about the notice shall be published in the municipalities within the project's area of influence in compliance with § 108 of the Local Government Act. Information that the notice is being made public shall be published in at least one newspaper with general circulation in the project's area of influence, unless the matter is of minor significance or it is otherwise unnecessary to publish the information. (12.4.2019/505)

The supervisory authority may, on the basis of the notification, conduct an inspection according to § 39 of the Administrative Procedure Act or take other measures as referred to in § 3 of this chapter to investigate whether the project has been implemented in accordance with the permit conditions.

Right to Initiate Matters

If a matter as referred to in § 4 or § 6 has not been initiated on the supervisory authority's initiative, the matter may be initiated in writing by:

a party,

a registered association or foundation whose purpose is to promote environmental protection, health protection, or nature conservation, or the amenity of the living environment, and within whose statutory area of activity the environmental consequences in question occur,

the municipality where the water management project is located or another municipality within whose area the project's environmental consequences occur,

an authority that protects the public interest in the matter.

On a decision issued under this Act, what is prescribed in § 122, subsection 3 of the Act on Court Proceedings in Administrative Matters about the enforcement of a decision that has not gained legal force does not apply. (5.7.2019/822)
The Vaasa Administrative Court may, at the applicant's request, establish that the project may be initiated under the permit decision despite an appeal having been lodged. It may be ordered that the decision be enforced in whole or in part or at a certain time, if it is shown that there are justified grounds for initiating the activity, that the enforcement does not render the appeal meaningless, and that the applicant provides acceptable security for compensation for the losses of benefits and the costs that a repeal of the decision or an amendment of the permit conditions may cause. The security is lodged with the regional state administrative agency. The requirement to provide security does not apply to the state and its institutions, nor to municipalities and joint municipal authorities.

Chapter 17
Provisions Concerning Real Property Law
Notification of Redemption
A decision by which the right has been granted or the obligation imposed to redeem a property or an unseparated area of a property, a jointly owned area for several properties, or an unseparated area of such an area or a subsidiary area as referred to in § 2, subsection 2 of the Real Property Register Act (392/1985) shall be reported without delay by the permit authority to the registration authority for an entry in the title and mortgage register.
When the redemption decision has gained legal force and the compensation determined in the decision has been paid to the owner or duly deposited, the permit authority shall notify the registration authority of this.
Transfer of Ownership
The ownership right to an area that has been redeemed under this Act passes to the recipient when an entry of the completed redemption has been made in the title and mortgage register.
The registration authority shall notify the competent real property registrar that the entry referred to in subsection 1 has been made.
Property Formation regarding a Redeemed Area
A redeemed area that is an unseparated area of a property, a jointly owned area for several properties, or an unseparated area of such an area or a subsidiary area is formed into a property by partitioning in the manner prescribed in the Real Property Formation Act (554/1995).
The partitioning proceeding is initiated when the notification from the registration authority under § 2, subsection 2 has reached the real property registrar.
Liens and Other Rights
A redeemed area becomes free from encumbering liens at the time referred to in § 2, subsection 1. The registration authority shall make entries about which objects the mortgages apply to and from which they are removed.
If another right concerning a property cannot be maintained as a result of a project being implemented or if the exercise of the right is significantly impeded and the holder of the right demands that it be redeemed, the permit authority shall, in the redemption decision, establish that the right shall cease to be valid at the time the decision has gained legal force and the compensation for the loss of the right has been paid or duly deposited.
Entry of Information into the Real Property Data System
The permit authority shall ensure that an entry is made in the real property data system regarding a legally binding decision by which the right has been granted to:
construct a channel or erect another structure on another's land,
permanently place another's area under water,
use hydropower belonging to another's property or a jointly owned area,
otherwise continuously use another's real property.
An entry shall also be made in the real property data system regarding:
a legally binding decision by which an area has been set aside as a protection area or its use has otherwise been restricted,
an agreement necessary for a permit that concerns a private property and gives the applicant for the permit the right to permanently place another's area under water.
An entry shall also be made regarding a legally binding decision by which a right of use or a restriction on use has been amended.
If the right concerns the right to lay a ditch, water pipeline, or sewer on another's land, to maintain a minor device or structure on another's area, or another such right of use or restriction on use that relates to only a small part of a property, the decision is not recorded in the real property data system.
Decisions made by the municipal environmental protection authority and decisions made at a drainage proceeding may also be recorded in the real property data system. The state supervisory authority that has decided that a drainage proceeding is to be held shall ensure that the decision made at the drainage proceeding is recorded in the real property data system.
Real Property Proceeding
If the information referred to in § 5 cannot be recorded in the real property data system without a special investigation, the National Land Survey of Finland shall, upon application by the permit authority, order that a real property proceeding be carried out. The provisions on property determination in the Real Property Formation Act shall apply to the proceeding. (13.12.2013/910)
The costs of the proceeding are paid by the person who has been granted the right to be recorded in the real property data system or at whose application the use of the property has been restricted. If the real property proceeding is needed for an investigation that is important from a public point of view, the proceeding is carried out at the state's expense.
Rights and Obligations upon Change of Ownership
If a property or a project, for the benefit of which a permit or a right as referred to in this Act has been granted or for the account of which participation has been taken in a measure that has brought benefit to the property or the project, is transferred to another, the rights and obligations that belonged to the person who was granted the permit or the right or who participated in the measure also pass to the new owner.
Rights that have been granted under this Act and that concern a property or other property belonging to another remain in force despite a change of ownership.
If a permit or a right to water regulation or water abstraction is transferred to another, the acquirer shall notify the state supervisory authority of the transfer. A notification of the transfer shall also be made if the permit includes a fishery conservation obligation.
(8.9.2017/611)
Granting of a Right of Use
The permit authority may grant the applicant such a right as is referred to in Chapter 2, §§ 12, 13, 13a, and 14, if:
the applicant has been granted a permit under this Act,
the applicant, in a manner other than under this Act, has obtained the right to the area that the project requires, but the area, due to a dispute, bankruptcy, or seizure, or for another reason, has been lost by the person to whom the area was considered to belong when the permit was granted, and
the right of use is considered necessary, taking into account the nature and significance of the project.
If a right to hydropower that has been put to use for a power plant has been lost in the manner referred to in subsection 1, point 2, the permit authority may, upon application, grant the owner of the power plant a permanent right of use to the hydropower as referred to in Chapter 8, § 5. A permit to build a power plant remains valid even if the right to the hydropower or to an area to be used for the power plant has been wholly or partially lost in the manner specified above.
The person who is granted a right as referred to in subsection 1 or 2 shall pay compensation for the right as prescribed in Chapter 13.
Securing a Right Based on an Agreement
When the right to a measure for which a permit can be granted under this Act is based on an agreement between the parties, a permit may, however, be granted upon application to ensure that the right in question also remains in force against a new owner of the property.
Provisions on the establishment of servitudes are in the Real Property Formation Act.
Building or Facility on Another's Land
What is prescribed in this Act about properties applies in applicable parts also to such buildings or facilities on another's land that, together with the right of possession to the land, can be transferred without hearing the landowner.
Land Consolidation
The permit authority shall send a legally binding permit decision to the National Land Survey of Finland if:
a right of use as referred to in Chapter 6, § 6 is granted by the decision, or
the implementation of the project to which the decision pertains means that land parcels are fragmented or become smaller, that connections are broken or impeded, or that another similar nuisance is caused as referred to in the Act on Land Consolidations due to Water Body Projects.
(13.12.2013/910)
Subsection 2 has been repealed by Act 8.9.2017/611. (8.9.2017/611)
In handling the matter, the Act on Land Consolidations due to Water Body Projects and § 133, subsection 2, § 133a, and § 134 of the Real Property Formation Act shall be observed.
Chapter 18
Special Provisions
Information to be Recorded in the Environmental Information Data System and the Nature Conservation Data System (5.1.2023/34)
Information shall be recorded in the environmental information data system about decisions issued by the permit authority, the Vaasa Administrative Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court under this Act. Information shall be recorded in the nature conservation data system about the decisions referred to in Chapter 2, § 11, subsection 2, which have been issued, and exemptions granted by the permit authority, the Vaasa Administrative Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court. (5.1.2023/34)
In the environmental information data system, information may also be recorded about:
decisions issued by the municipal environmental protection authority under this Act,
decisions issued at drainage proceedings,
notifications to the supervisory authorities,
authority decisions issued under corresponding older legislation.
The identification and contact details of the parties may be recorded in the data system.
More detailed provisions on the information to be recorded in the data system may be issued by Government decree.
Entry of Information
The entry in the environmental information data system and the nature conservation data system is made by the authority that decided the matter. If a matter has been decided at a drainage proceeding, the entry is made by the state supervisory authority that ordered the drainage proceeding to be held. (5.1.2023/34)
The state supervisory authority shall also make an entry about such an amendment of a public fairway as is referred to in Chapter 10, § 4, subsection 2 in the environmental information data system.
For entries based on decisions issued by the Vaasa Administrative Court or the Supreme Administrative Court, the authority referred to in subsection 1 is responsible.
An Authority's Right to Obtain Information Free of Charge
The permit authority, the state supervisory authority, and the municipal environmental protection authority have the right, regardless of confidentiality provisions, to obtain free of charge from the environmental information data system such information as they need to perform their duties under this Act.
The Finnish Transport Agency has the right to obtain, free of charge from the principal of a public local fairway, the necessary information for nautical charts.
(30.12.2013/1193)
Account of Damming and Tapping Measures in a Catchment Area
The state supervisory authority shall, where necessary, compile an account of measures by which the harmful effects of flooding or drought can be reduced (account of damming and tapping measures in a catchment area). The account shall cover measures that affect the water level and water flow and which the project proponent can carry out when a water management project is implemented. The account shall also investigate the possibilities of coordinating the measures with other water management projects in the catchment area in such a way that the harmful consequences of flooding or drought, according to a holistic assessment, become as minor as possible. The account shall be compiled in sufficient cooperation with the project proponents and with the municipalities and other authorities.
Based on the account of damming and tapping measures in the catchment area, the state supervisory authority may submit an application to the permit authority for a review of the permit conditions or the issuance of new conditions for a water management project under Chapter 3, § 21, subsection 1, point 4.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry may order a Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment to perform the tasks referred to in subsections 1 and 2 within the area of activity of another Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment.
Measures for Averting Danger
If exceptional natural conditions or another overwhelming event leads to flooding or another such change in a water body or its water conditions that may cause a general danger to people's lives, safety, or health, great damage to public interests, or great and extensive damage to private interests, the permit authority shall order the state supervisory authority or the person responsible for the water management project to take the necessary temporary measures to avert the danger or limit the damage. The order may be issued regardless of what is prescribed in this Act or determined in a permit or decision issued by virtue of it. (30.12.2013/1193)
If, for the implementation of a water management project for which a permit has been granted, urgent temporary measures are required because drought, flooding, a landslide, ice, or some other exceptional circumstance threatens the project, the permit authority may, upon application, grant the person responsible for the water management project the right to take the measures needed to prevent negative consequences.
An application for the issuance of an order as referred to in subsection 1 may be made by the state supervisory authority. If the urgent nature of the matter or other compelling circumstances so require, an application as referred to in subsections 1 and 2 may be handled without observing the provisions on the handling of application matters in Chapter 11. Such a decision by the permit authority as is referred to in subsections 1 and 2 may be enforced even if it is appealed.
Prevention of Damage Caused by Ice
Owners of facilities or structures, floaters, and state authorities have the right, for the purpose of preventing damage or nuisance caused by ice formation or ice, to blast ice, set up temporary booms, and take other necessary measures.
When blasting ice jams, necessary caution must be exercised. The blasting must be carried out in such a way that public or generally used winter roads are not cut off without compelling reason or the fish stock is not significantly damaged. The police and the state supervisory authority shall be notified of the blasting.
Loss of Benefit as a Result of Averting Danger and Preventing Damage
Loss of benefit that has directly affected property as a result of measures as referred to in § 4, subsection 1 shall be compensated from state funds. Such loss of benefit caused by a loss of hydropower is not considered damage to be compensated. If the person entitled to compensation has benefited from an event as referred to in § 4, subsection 1 or from measures to avert danger, the compensation may be adjusted as is deemed reasonable.
Loss of benefit as a result of a measure as referred to in § 4, subsection 2 and § 5 shall be compensated upon application. The person who carries out the measure is liable for compensation.
Investigation Permit
If an agreement on the matter is not reached, the permit authority may, upon application, grant the right to carry out, in another's area, such investigations of the soil, water quantity, and other conditions as are needed to investigate the consequences of or the possibilities of implementing a project referred to in this Act or to ascertain the groundwater resources (investigation permit). More detailed provisions on the content of the permit application and the reports to be attached to the application may be issued by Government decree.
The investigations shall be carried out in such a way that they cause as little nuisance as possible to the owner of the area and the use of the area. Unless otherwise follows from special reasons, the owner or possessor of the area shall be notified of the investigation in advance.
The owner or possessor of the area that is the subject of an application for an investigation permit shall be heard on account of the application. An investigation permit is granted for a fixed term, and the permit shall include the necessary conditions to avoid nuisance. Loss of benefit as a result of the investigation work shall be compensated.
A decision on an investigation permit may be enforced even if it is appealed. The appellate court may order that the work be interrupted or limited. An appeal concerning an investigation permit shall be handled expeditiously.
Disputes to be Decided by the Permit Authority
The permit authority shall, upon application, decide disputes concerning the need for a permit, the application of permit conditions, the implementation of a project, the maintenance obligation, the removal of a facility or a structure, or the restoration of conditions, if the decision will obviously affect the rights or benefits of others than the plaintiff or the defendant.
If a matter as referred to in subsection 1 has been brought before the district court, the district court shall transfer the matter to the permit authority to the extent referred to in subsection 1. A compensation claim may not be decided by the district court before a dispute as referred to in subsection 1 has been decided by a legally binding decision.
Disputes concerning Right of Use or Ownership
If the parties disagree on the right of use or ownership that the granting of a permit or a right requires, the permit authority shall, if it cannot decide the question as a preliminary issue in connection with the handling of the application, by its decision, instruct the parties to, within a set time, bring an action in the district court or, if the matter is to be decided at a real property proceeding under § 281 of the Real Property Formation Act, to apply for such a proceeding.
A decision as referred to in subsection 1 does not prevent the continued handling of the application and the decision of the permit matter, unless the permit authority considers that there are compelling reasons to postpone the handling until the dispute has been settled.
Statement from the Permit Authority
If a general court is handling a civil or criminal case that cannot be decided without special insights into water management matters, the court shall obtain a statement from the permit authority within whose area of activity the water conditions are affected.
Enforcement of Decisions in Certain Cases
If, in a legally binding decision issued under this Act, it is determined about a right of use or a right of redemption or about compensations or obligations as referred to in Chapter 13, what is prescribed about the enforcement of a legally binding judgment in applicable parts shall apply to the enforcement of the decision.
Fees for the Handling of a Matter
A fee may be charged for the handling by the permit authority and the supervisory authority of a matter as referred to in this Act. No fee is charged for the handling of a matter that has been initiated on the initiative of an authority or on the initiative of a party who has been caused a nuisance. For the handling of a matter that has been initiated at the request of another, a fee may be charged if it is to be considered obvious that the matter has been brought without grounds. (8.9.2017/611)
The fee charged by the state is determined in accordance with the Act on Criteria for Charges Payable to the State and the Government decree issued by virtue of it. The fee charged by a municipality is determined according to the tariff that the municipality approves. The grounds for the tariff that the municipality has approved shall, in applicable parts, be consistent with the Act on Criteria for Charges Payable to the State.
The permit authority may decide that an advance fee shall be paid for the handling costs as referred to in subsection 1 and at the same time determine that the handling of the matter will not continue until payment has been made or acceptable security for the payment has been provided. The advance fee shall be based on a calculation made by the permit authority.
A fee for a decision under Chapter 3, § 11, subsection 3 and § 15 that an authority appointed by the permit authority issues may be charged in accordance with what is prescribed in subsection 1.
Collection of Certain Fees
The following fees are directly enforceable:
the fishery management fee,
fees collected under Chapter 5, § 27 from the members of a drainage association,
fees collected under Chapter 6, § 12 from the members of an association formed for the permanent change of the mean water level,
advance fees as referred to in Chapter 5, § 39, subsection 3 and § 12, subsection 3 of this chapter.
In the collection of the fees referred to in subsection 1, what is prescribed in the Act on the Enforcement of Taxes and Fees (706/2007) shall be observed. A basic appeal against the debiting shall, however, be lodged with the Vaasa Administrative Court.
Submission of Information concerning Marine Protection
The Ministry of the Environment or an authority appointed by the Ministry shall provide information about permits concerning marine protection that have been granted under this Act and about investigations concerning the permits in accordance with what is prescribed in § 13, subsection 1 of the Marine Protection Act (1415/1994).
When it concerns other notifications regarding Finland's territorial waters and economic zone, what is prescribed in § 13, subsections 2 and 3 of the Marine Protection Act shall apply correspondingly.
Measures under the Fish Waters Directive
For the implementation of Council Directive 78/659/EEC on the quality of fresh waters needing protection or improvement in order to support fish life, it is prescribed by Government decree on the grounds for the selection of waters for fish waters, the requirements for water quality in fish waters and monitoring of the quality, and the action programmes to be drawn up to improve the state of the waters.
The Ministry of the Environment selects which areas are to be regarded as fish waters, determines which analysis methods are to be used in the monitoring, and decides when the monitoring is to cease. The environmental administration is responsible for organizing the monitoring and drawing up the action programmes.
Council Directive 78/659/EEC has been repealed by EP Directive 2006/44/EC, see EP Directive 2000/60/EC.
Boundary Water Bodies
The provisions of this Act shall also apply to water bodies and waters at the national border, unless otherwise is prescribed by virtue of an agreement with a foreign state.
Consequences that a water management project has on water bodies or groundwater in another state shall, in the application of this Act, be taken into account as corresponding consequences in Finland, unless otherwise follows from an agreement with the state in question.
Exchange of Information between Authorities
When the state supervisory authority receives a notification as referred to in Chapter 2, § 15, the authority shall notify the municipal environmental protection authority within whose area the measure is taken or to whose area the effects of the measure extend.
Determination of the Boundaries of a Water Area
If the boundary against land for a water area as referred to in Chapter 1, § 5 is difficult to determine as a result of such fluctuations in the water level that have been caused by the regulation of the water body, the permit authority may, in its permit decision or upon separate application, where necessary, determine where the boundary is to be considered to run.
If it is permitted to keep the water at a certain highest level during a significant part of the growing season, the boundary of the water area against land may be determined in accordance with this level. In other cases, the permit authority shall, when it determines the boundary, appropriately take into account the time and duration of the highest permitted water levels during the regulation period.
(27.11.2020/907)
Information Service for Water Management Matters
After the prescribed time for lodging an appeal has expired, the permit authority shall publish on its website its decision on a water management matter, if publication, taking into account the significance of the matter, is not to be considered unnecessary (information service for water management matters). The decision may state the name of the project proponent and the names and property identifiers of the properties within the project's area of influence. The information may be made public, unless otherwise follows from confidentiality provisions, and it may be made public despite the provisions in § 16, subsection 3 of the Act on the Openness of Government Activities. Personal data in the decision shall be deleted from the website after the project has been completed.
In the information service for water management matters, information may be searched by a limited search using the matter's identification data, the project proponent's name, the project type, or the current municipality or the time of the decision as search criteria.
(22.6.2022/491)
Publication of Old Decisions
A decision concerning a water management matter that has been issued before 1 May 2019 may be published on the website of the authority that has issued the decision or on the joint website of the environmental administration. The decision may state the name of the project proponent and the names and property identifiers of the properties within the project's area of influence.
The information may be made public if nothing else follows from confidentiality provisions, and it may be made public despite the provisions in § 16, subsection 3 of the Act on the Openness of Government Activities. Personal data included in the decision shall be deleted from the website after the project has been completed.
Chapter 19
Entry into Force
Entry into Force
This Act enters into force on 1 January 2012.
Measures required for the enforcement of this Act may be taken before the Act enters into force.
Previous Enactments
This Act repeals the Water Act (264/1961), hereinafter the old Water Act.
The decisions issued by the Government and the Ministry of the Environment and the regulations issued by virtue of the old Water Act remain in force until otherwise is determined by virtue of this Act.
If another Act refers to the Water Act that was in force at the entry into force of this Act, this Act shall be applied instead.
Pending Matters
On matters that are pending at administrative authorities or courts when this Act enters into force, the provisions that were in force at the time of entry into force shall be applied, unless otherwise is prescribed in this chapter.
If an appellate court repeals a decision to which provisions that were in force at the entry into force of this Act are to be applied and refers the matter back to be handled in its entirety anew, the matter shall be handled and decided according to the provisions of this Act.
Application of Older Provisions
On a project or a measure as referred to in this Act, the implementation of which has been lawfully initiated before the entry into force of this Act, the corresponding older provisions and regulations shall be applied, unless otherwise is prescribed in this chapter.
A permit for a project or a measure as referred to in this Act that is valid at the entry into force of this Act shall be complied with. On the implementation of the project or measure and the review of the permit, the permit conditions and corresponding older provisions and regulations shall be applied, unless otherwise is prescribed in this chapter. On the maintenance and removal of projects and measures, Chapter 2, § 9 shall apply.
What is prescribed in subsection 2 about permits shall also apply to other such authority decisions on a project or a measure that were valid at the entry into force of this Act. On the maintenance and use of ditches, Chapter 5, § 8 shall apply.
Review of Permit Conditions
If, in a permit granted before the entry into force of this Act or in another authority decision equivalent to a permit concerning a water management project, it has been determined about a review of the permit conditions, what is prescribed in Chapter 3, § 21 shall apply to the review.
Unless otherwise follows from this chapter, the permit authority may, upon application, review the conditions in a permit that has been granted before this Act has entered into force or issue new conditions, observing in applicable parts what is prescribed in Chapter 3, § 21. What is determined in this subsection about permits also applies to other authority decisions that can be equated with a permit.

Supervision and Administrative Enforcement
The provisions on supervision and administrative enforcement in Chapter 14 shall also apply to such water management projects for which a permit or right has been granted or which have been initiated before the entry into force of this Act.
Water Regulation
If a water regulation project based on a permit granted before 1 May 1991 has significant detrimental effects on the water environment or its use, the competent state supervisory authority shall investigate the possibilities of reducing the detrimental effects of the regulation. The investigation shall be carried out in sufficient cooperation with the permit holder, those who benefit from the regulation, the municipalities within the area of influence, and the concerned authorities. The state supervisory authority shall, where necessary, also hear other parties.
When an investigation as referred to in subsection 1 has been carried out, the state supervisory authority, the fisheries authority, or the municipality may apply for the permit conditions to be reviewed or for new conditions to be issued, if the detrimental effects cannot otherwise be sufficiently reduced.
A prerequisite for the review is that it, taking the circumstances into account, brings significant benefit to public interests. The review may also not significantly reduce the total benefit that the water regulation brings or substantially change the original purpose of the regulation, unless it has already lost its original purpose. If it is obvious that there are grounds for a review, the permit authority may, if the application documents do not contain sufficient information, also oblige the permit holder to submit necessary supplementary information to the permit authority. An appeal against such a decision by the permit authority may not be lodged separately. If the permit holder does not submit supplementary information within the set time, the information may be obtained at the permit holder's expense. For the review, the applicable parts of what is prescribed in Chapter 3, § 21 shall apply.
The applicant shall be ordered, observing the applicable parts of Chapter 13, to compensate for losses of benefits that the review leads to, if the losses are not minor. The compensations are, however, paid from state funds, unless the review is mainly of local significance. Compensation for a loss of benefit that the water regulation has brought may be adjusted, taking into account the benefit and the losses of benefits that the review leads to and the time during which the beneficiary has been able to utilize the regulation.
Permit Conditions Affecting the Water Level or the Flow of Water
Such permit conditions that affect the flow or the level of the water and which have been issued in a permit for a water management project other than regulation before the entry into force of this Act may be reviewed or new conditions may be issued, observing the applicable parts of § 7.
Monitoring Obligation
The permit authority may, upon the application of the state supervisory authority, impose a monitoring obligation according to Chapter 3, § 11, even when it concerns a project that has been granted a permit in accordance with provisions that were in force before the entry into force of this Act. Regarding the imposition and amendment of a monitoring obligation, the applicable parts of Chapter 3, § 11 shall apply.
Fishery Conservation Obligation and Fishery Management Fee
The permit authority may, in accordance with Chapter 3, § 22, upon application, also amend such conditions concerning a fishery conservation obligation or a fishery management fee that have been issued under older legislation corresponding to this Act.
The amendment may be made provided that it is considered necessary with regard to a public interest or an important private interest. The permit authority shall in its decision take into account how long a time has passed since the fishery management fee was imposed and other circumstances that affect the matter.
Fairways
What is prescribed in Chapter 10, § 4 shall, in applicable parts, also apply to a legally binding decision on a public fairway that has been issued before the entry into force of this Act.
Such decisions on the establishment of public fairways that the National Board of Navigation has issued before 1 September 1992 remain in force. On these fairways, what is prescribed in this Act about public fairways shall apply.
Previously Built Structures
If a permit to build in a water body has been granted under provisions that were in force before the entry into force of the old Water Act, the permit authority may, upon application, oblige the owner of a structure erected under the permit to allow the construction of necessary devices for the preservation of the fish stock, the securing of traffic, the conduct of floating, or the securing of the state of the water body, and to release the necessary amount of water for their use.
A loss of benefit that has been caused to the owner of the structure as a result of the order under subsection 1 shall be compensated, unless it is minor. If the owner of the structure, however, according to the legislation referred to in subsection 1, was obliged to remove it without compensation and does not wish to remove it, the permit authority may oblige the owner to erect the necessary devices and structures at their own expense.
Water-Law Associations
The provisions on water-law associations in this Act also apply to water-law associations formed before the entry into force of this Act.
If an association's bylaws contain provisions that are contrary to this Act, the provisions of this Act shall apply in their place.
(27.6.2014/531)
Discharge of Wastewater
If a measure as referred to in Chapter 10 of the old Water Act has been taken before the entry into force of this Act or if a channel or facility for the discharge of wastewater has been taken into use before 1 April 1962, § 158 of the Environmental Protection Act shall apply.
Application for a New Permit
A person who, before the entry into force of this Act, has received a permit to implement a water management project or who has otherwise legally implemented a measure under older corresponding provisions may, upon application, be granted a permit under this Act.
A permit that is granted may be combined with conditions that are necessary to protect public or private interests and that do not significantly reduce the benefit of the project or lead to costs that are unreasonable in relation to the benefit of the project.
Clarification of a Previous Decision
If, for a water management project under older legislation corresponding to this Act, a permit or a right has been granted by a decision of an authority and there is uncertainty regarding the content of the permit or the right or the permit or right holders, the permit authority may clarify the decision or replace it with a decision under this Act.
In the decision, such necessary conditions shall be issued as prescribed in Chapter 3, §§ 10–14 for the purpose of ensuring public or private interests, to avoid nuisances that are based on or specify the previous decision. The conditions may not significantly reduce the benefit of using the permit or the right, and they may not lead to costs that are unreasonable in relation to the benefit of the project.
An application in a matter as referred to in subsection 1 may be made by the permit or right holder, the supervisory authority, the person who owns an area that is directly subject to the project, or the holder of another right that relates to the area. The permit authority may, on its own initiative, take up the matter for consideration if it is necessary on account of another matter pending at the permit authority.
What is prescribed above in this section applies in applicable parts also to other measures that have been legally implemented under older legislation corresponding to this Act.
Determining that a Previously Granted Permit or Right shall Cease to be Valid
It may be decided that a permit or a right that is based on a decision issued under older legislation corresponding to this Act shall cease to be valid, observing Chapter 3, §§ 24 and 25.
Right of Use to Hydropower
A power plant owner who, in accordance with the legislation that was in force before the entry into force of the old Water Act, has been granted a permit to build a power plant and, in connection with the permit, the right for a fixed term to utilize hydropower belonging to another, may, as an initiator, invite the other partners in the hydropower to participate in the project in the manner determined in Chapter 8, § 8. This right is held by the owner of the power plant even when their share in the hydropower is less than one-fifth.
The application for a public notice shall be made before the right granted for a fixed term has expired, when at least four-fifths of the time limit has passed. The initiator and those who have the right to participate in the project and wish to do so may be granted a new permit and a permanent right of use to hydropower belonging to others, observing what is prescribed in Chapter 8, §§ 2, 5, and 7.
Utilization of Hydropower Belonging to Another
If, at a power plant for the construction of which a permit has been granted under the legislation that was in force before the entry into force of the old Water Act, hydropower belonging to another is also utilized and it has not been ordered or, to one's knowledge, agreed upon regarding the power plant owner's right to the hydropower, the power plant owner has such a right as is referred to in § 18.
A person who can prove their right to hydropower that has been put to use for a power plant as referred to in subsection 1 may, by application, request that the permit authority set a time within which the power plant owner shall initiate the procedure specified in Chapter 8, § 5. Regarding the handling of the matter, the applicable parts of what is prescribed in Chapter 14 on administrative enforcement shall apply.
Right to Participate in the Construction of a Power Plant
A person who, by virtue of a partner's share in a joint property unit before the entry into force of the Act, has obtained a permanent right of use to hydropower has, despite the Act on Jointly Owned Areas, the right to participate in the construction of a power plant in accordance with Chapter 8, § 5.
Water Decisions Register
The water decisions register as referred to in Chapter 12, § 11 of the old Water Act becomes a part of the environmental information data system.
