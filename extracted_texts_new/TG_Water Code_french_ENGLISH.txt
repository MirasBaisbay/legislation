5.  **Principle of sustainable development**, according to which the development and management of water resources must, from an environmental perspective, meet the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own;
6.  **Principle of water management by river basin**, considered, instead of administrative units, as the framework for planning and participation (preparation of IWRM master plans) and for the management/protection of water resources, coherently integrating all components of the natural water cycle and all its uses, including upstream/downstream relationships;
7.  **Principle of cooperation**, according to which public authorities, international institutions, development partners, non-governmental organizations, and individuals contribute in an organized manner to managing and protecting water resources at all levels;
8.  **Precautionary principle**, which refers to preventive measures taken to avoid or reduce any risk of pollution of water resources or any danger that could affect water resources during the planning or execution of activities likely to have an impact on this environmental medium and the populations that depend on it. The absence of complete scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing measures that would prevent the danger or mitigate its effects;
9.  **"Polluter-pays" principle**, according to which the polluter should be charged the expenses related not only to combating water pollution but also to the preventive measures undertaken by public authorities;
10. **"User-pays" principle**, a set of defined rules that allow for the pricing of water use according to the type of use, and the quality and quantity of water used.
11. **Principle of responsibility**, which determines how society and individuals must assume their powers and duties with regard to the water resource. This responsibility must be exercised by ensuring that current and future uses do not cause harm to the resource.

**Art. 4:** The use of water resources shall be in accordance with the general provisions of this code and subject to respect for the rights of third parties.
