under para. 1 are determined by the river basin management plans.
(3) In cases where more than one of the objectives under para. 1 are set for a single water body, the most stringent one is adopted.

**Art. 156b.** (New - SG, No. 65 of 2006, in force from 11.08.2006) (1) A surface water body may be designated as artificial or heavily modified when:

status within the period under item 3, a schedule for their implementation, as well as the reasons for any significant delay;

**Art. 156d.** (New - SG, No. 65 of 2006, in force from 11.08.2006) The environmental protection objectives may be less stringent for specific water bodies when, during the analysis and review under Art. 156h, items 1 and 2, it is established that they have been significantly affected by human activity or that their natural conditions are such that the achievement of the environmental protection objectives under Art. 156a, para. 1 is impossible or economically unreasonable and when the following conditions are met:
1. the ecological and socio-economic needs provided by such activity cannot be met by such means, guaranteeing a significantly better environmental protection at comparable costs;
2. there are impacts that could not have been avoided due to the nature of the human activity or pollution and have been achieved:
a) the best possible ecological and chemical status for surface waters;
b) the smallest possible changes in the good status of groundwaters;
3. no further deterioration in the status of the waters in the affected water body occurs;

(2) In the cases under para. 1, it is required:
1. that all practical measures be taken to reduce the adverse impact on the status of the water body;
2. the reasons for the established changes or deviations to be explicitly stated and explained in the river basin management plan and the objectives to be reviewed every 6 years;
