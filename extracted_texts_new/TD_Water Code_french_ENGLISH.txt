Article 29.- Legal persons under public law, and in particular decentralized authorities, are required to make available to the State the installations, equipment, and generally the assets that are part of their domain and are necessary for the operation of the public hydraulic domain. These assets shall benefit from the protection regime of the public domain. In the absence of an amicable agreement between the State and the concerned decentralized authority, the terms for making assets available as referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be established by a decree issued by the Council of Ministers after consultation with the Regulatory Body. Article 30.- When a private person holds rights to a piece of land whose use is necessary for the operation of the public hydraulic domain, the State may, in the absence of an amicable agreement and at the request of the delegate, resort to an expropriation procedure for reasons of public utility, subject to just and fair compensation. Chapter 2.- 6 Use of the Public Hydraulic Domain Article 31.- The operators of the Public Drinking Water Service shall benefit, under the delegation agreement, from a title of occupation of the public domain which authorizes them to use the appurtenances of the public hydraulic domain and to abstract water from specified sites and in specified volumes under the conditions provided for in Article 52. This right may only be exercised within the limits of what is necessary for the proper execution of the Public Service. Article 32.- The holder of the right to use the public domain and to abstract water may, for the duration of this right, hold a real property right over the permanent works, constructions, and installations that they build for the exercise of the activity for which they are authorized to occupy the domain. The specifications of the delegation shall specify the legal nature of the existing and future works, constructions, and installations and shall determine the basis of the delegate's real right, taking into account the needs of the Public Service. Article 33.- The property right mentioned in the preceding article is assignable and transferable. The works, constructions, and installations may only be mortgaged to guarantee loans contracted by the holder of the right to use the domain, for the purpose of financing the creation, modification, or extension of the permanent works, constructions, and installations located on the occupied public domain appurtenance. Mortgages on the said works shall be extinguished no later than upon the expiration of the right to use the public hydraulic domain. The works, constructions, and installations may be financed through leasing. The permanent works, constructions, and installations may only be assigned or transferred in the context of transactions between living persons or of company mergers, acquisitions, or demergers, for the remaining duration of the right to use the public hydraulic domain, including in the event of the realization of the security or the completion of the leasing operation relating to the said assets, to a person approved by the domain authority, for a use compatible with the purpose of the public hydraulic domain. Article 34.- Upon the expiration of the right to use the public hydraulic domain, the permanent works, constructions, and installations existing on the occupied domain appurtenance must be demolished, either by the beneficiary of the right of use, or at their expense at the request of the competent authority, unless their preservation in their current state has been expressly provided for by the right of use of the domain or unless the domain authority waives their demolition in whole or in part. The permanent works, constructions, and installations whose preservation upon the expiration of the right to use the public hydraulic domain has been accepted shall become the property of the State by right and against compensation, free and clear of all privileges and mortgages. In the event of the withdrawal of the right to use the public hydraulic domain for a reason other than the non-performance of its obligations by the holder of the right, the holder of the right shall be compensated for the direct, material, and certain prejudice resulting from the early termination. The rules for determining the compensation must be specified in the agreement constituting authorization to use the public hydraulic domain. The rights of creditors duly registered on the date of the early withdrawal shall be transferred to this compensation. In the event of early withdrawal for non-performance of the clauses and conditions of the authorization, the domain authority shall inform the duly registered creditors two months before the notification of the withdrawal decision so that they may be able to propose the substitution of a third party for the defaulting occupying delegate. 7 The right to use the public hydraulic domain and to abstract water is renewable in favor of its delegate, subject to modifications that may be made in the public interest. Article 35.- Persons benefiting from the right to use the public domain and to abstract water from the public hydraulic domain referred to in Article 31 are required to: use water in a rational and economical manner; ensure that water quality is maintained; respect the rights of other persons benefiting from an abstraction right pertaining to the same waters; refrain from damaging the natural environment. The rights to use the public hydraulic domain referred to in Article 31 are personal and may not be transferred. They are precarious and may be withdrawn or limited at any time by a decision of the Minister in charge of Water, particularly in the event of scarcity due to climatic factors. The domain authority may oblige the delegate to accept a temporary limitation of the rights inherent in the right to use the public hydraulic domain and to abstract water in order to carry out, after modification and in such a way as to minimize the damage caused to the interested party, works of general interest on the public hydraulic domain.

Chapter 4.- Delegation of Public Service Section 1 10 Delegation Contracts Article 48.- The exploitation of mineral waters constitutes a public service. In addition to direct state management, the State may delegate by contract to any legal person under Chadian law the execution of this mission for which it is responsible, and in particular, the maintenance, operation, and development of the drinking water supply systems referred to in Articles 38 and 39. This delegation may take the form of a concession of public works and services, a lease (affermage), a management contract (gérance), a management contract with incentive payments (régie intéressée), and more generally, any agreement that has the effect of entrusting all or part of the execution of the public service mission to the public or private legal persons referred to above.

Article 53.- A decree shall establish the principles applicable to the relationship between the operator and the users of the Public Drinking Water Service, particularly with regard to access to the network. Article 54.- The delegation contract is concluded in consideration of the person of the operator. The operator may not assign the contract to a third party except with express authorization by decree. The operator may subcontract a part of the obligations for which it is responsible. It shall then remain fully responsible for the proper execution of the delegated service vis-à-vis the State. Furthermore, subcontracting is only authorized if its scope is not so extensive that the operator effectively loses operational control of the delegated service. Article 55.- The delegation contract is concluded for a limited duration which may not exceed thirty (30) years. 11 Upon the expiration of a delegation contract, the State may only conclude a new delegation contract relating to the Public Water Service under the conditions provided for in this chapter and in particular following a call for tenders. Article 56.- The State and the operator may at any time, by mutual agreement and after consultation with the Regulatory Body, modify the clauses of the delegation contract and/or its annexes, in particular to govern the conditions under which the operator may serve or use sites not initially provided for in the specifications. These modifications shall be made by means of addenda signed under the conditions referred to in Article 51. Article 57.- The State may also impose unilateral modifications to the conditions of the delegation contract in the interest of the Public Service. The modifications imposed by the administration may not have the purpose of charging the operator with a Public Service distinct from the Public Drinking Water Service or of extending the duration of the delegation contract by more than one year beyond the term initially set. If these modifications, due to the new burdens they impose on the operator, significantly alter the financial equilibrium of the contract, the operator has the right to be compensated for the amount of its potential loss of earnings or may request an extension of the duration of the delegation contract. Article 58.- The operator's activity relating to the Public Water Service is subject to the ordinary legal and tax regime applicable in the Republic of Chad, without prejudice to the application of the provisions of this Code. As such, it shall pay all taxes, duties, fees, and charges of any nature whatsoever. In particular, the operator is authorized to deduct from its profits, tax-free, obsolescence depreciation annuities on the installations that must be handed over to the State without compensation at the end of the delegation contract. It may be admitted to one of the preferential regimes of the Investment Code. Section 2 Legal Regime of Works Article 59.- In accordance with Article 32 of this Code, the schedule of specifications of the delegation agreement shall specify the legal nature of existing and future works, constructions, and installations and shall consequently determine the basis of the delegate's real right, taking into account the needs of the public service. Article 60.- Assets necessary for the functioning of the Public Water Service that are part of the public hydraulic domain, once they have been specially developed for this purpose, may only be transferred under the conditions provided for other appurtenances of the public domain. These assets, constituting "return assets" (biens de retour), include the assets that the delegate undertakes to create and which are specifically assigned to the public service, the object of the delegation, as well as the assets made available to the delegate by the delegating authority. These assets may be made available to the operator for a duration not exceeding that of the delegation contract. No provision of assets may be granted unless the operator has previously subscribed in the delegation contract to commitments of a nature to guarantee the proper maintenance of the assets. The operator may not grant any real right or security of any nature whatsoever to a third party over the assets made available to it under this paragraph. 12 During the period of provision, the assets shall remain the property of the public entity to which they belong. Assets not made available to the delegate by the delegating authority but created by the delegate shall be incorporated into the public domain upon their completion and shall be the public property of the Delegating Authority. The delegate may not hold any real property right over the said assets. The schedule of specifications annexed to the delegation contract shall determine the assets referred to in the preceding paragraph and may require the operator to rehabilitate certain assets made available to it. Article 61.- Works that are useful without being specifically assigned to the functioning of the Public Water Service, which the operator may be required to create, are classified as "buy-back assets" (biens de reprise) and are intended to revert to the State upon the expiration of the delegation contract. During the validity period of the delegation agreement, these assets are held in full ownership by the delegate under the conditions set out in Articles 32 to 34 of this Code. The schedule of specifications annexed to the delegation contract shall determine the works that will or may revert to the State upon the expiration of the delegation contract and shall specify the cases in which a buy-back indemnity may be due from the State to the operator. Article 62.- Other assets that do not belong to one of the categories referred to in Articles 60 and 61 are the property of the delegate, who may exercise this real right under the conditions set out in Articles 32 to 34 of this Code. Section 3 Control of the Operator's Activity Article 63.- To ensure control over the proper execution of the delegation contract, agents of the Regulatory Body, mandated according to procedures fixed by decree, shall have a right to inspect the operator's installations. They may obtain any document necessary for this control. Article 64.- In the event of an operator's failure to meet its obligations, the Minister in charge of Water may, at the request of the Regulatory Body or on his own initiative, after having given the operator the opportunity to present its observations, take the following measures, depending on the seriousness of the failure: 1- An injunction to comply with the provisions of the delegation contract and its annexes; 2- Contractual penalties and damages; 3- Authorization given to a person other than the operator to manage the part of the Public Service that is not being executed by the operator in accordance with the specifications; 4- Direct management by the State, at the operator's expense, of the part of the Public Service that is not being performed by the operator in accordance with the specifications; 5- Termination of the delegation contract. The measures referred to in this article may be the subject of an action for annulment before the competent court under the legislation in force. 13 Section 4 Development Fund for the Drinking Water and Sanitation Sector Article 65.- The development of drinking water and sanitation shall be financed by the National Water Fund (FNE) provided for in Title VIII.
