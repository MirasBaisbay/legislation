#### **TITLE THREE**
#### **Water Use Rights**

**Article 21** - Water ownership rights, particularly in the southern oases, existing at the date of promulgation of this Code and determined by the Water Rights Settlement Committee under the conditions specified below, shall be converted into water usufruct rights, the volume of which shall be equal to the volume of the ownership rights.

**Article 22** - The water usufruct right entitles its holder to dispose, under all circumstances, of a specific annual volume of the total available water resources, subject to the provisions set forth below.

**Article 23** - The water usufruct right remains attached to a specific parcel of land, within the framework of use focused on the maximum valuation of the cubic meter of water. The holder of the water usufruct right may not, except in cases of imperative necessity and with the approval of the National Water Committee, use the water to which they are entitled for the benefit of another parcel of land.
In the event of a transfer of the land, the water usufruct right is obligatorily transferred to the new owner, who must declare the said transfer within six months from the date of the land transfer.
Any transfer of a water usufruct right that takes place separately from the land for which the right was granted shall be considered null and void. In the event of a subdivision of the land, the distribution of water among the resulting parcels shall become the subject of new water usufruct rights that replace the original usufruct right.

**Article 24** - Water usufruct rights may be revised taking into account the total available water resources, based on actual needs and the objective of maximizing the value of each cubic meter of water.

**Article 25** - Usufruct rights may, in particular, be modified due to a comprehensive program for the revitalization of irrigation in the concerned area, within the framework of maximizing the value of each cubic meter of water, with priority given to meeting drinking water needs.
The aforementioned revitalization program, initiated by the administration or the beneficiaries, shall be subject to an administrative inquiry for a period of thirty days after the observations or objections have been examined by the relevant Water Interest Group and then by the National Water Committee.
The program, revised as necessary, becomes binding on all parties upon approval by the Minister of Agriculture. Disputes concerning the modifications made to the said usufruct rights shall be brought before the competent courts, which may only award indemnities to the aggrieved parties.

**Article 26** - Within the framework of the program provided for in Article 25 of this Code, if meeting water needs requires the construction of water infrastructure, the resulting expenses shall be borne by the State. The related operating expenses shall be divided proportionally to the volume of water actually distributed.
However, the State shall bear the operating expenses for the quantities corresponding to the water rights established as of the date of promulgation of this Code, until the complete cessation of artesian flow and the drying up of the springs that were the source of the said rights.

**Article 27** - If the construction and use of the water infrastructure provided for in the preceding article allow for an increase in the available water quantities, the related operating expenses shall be divided per cubic meter of additional water obtained, after deducting the expenses borne by the State pursuant to Article 26 of this Code.

**Article 28** - Owners and beneficiaries who claim to have acquired water rights must, within one year from the date of promulgation of this Code, submit a request to the Minister of Agriculture to establish their rights, accompanied by all useful supporting documents; otherwise, their right shall be forfeited. The Minister of Agriculture shall rule on these rights, unless an action is brought before the courts.
The establishment of these acquired rights to waters belonging to the public water domain is subject to the conditions set out in the following articles.

**Article 29** - The Minister of Agriculture shall determine the established and recognized water rights after obtaining the opinion of the Settlement Committee. The organization and functioning of the said Settlement Committee shall be determined by decree.
If rights that were the subject of a declaration within the specified time limits are not recognized, persons who consider themselves aggrieved by the decision of the Minister of Agriculture may bring their case before the courts within one year from the date of notification of the decision. Such persons may only claim an indemnity.

**Article 30** - Acquired usufruct rights over springs originating on private land may be established by the Minister of Agriculture, upon submission of a request by the beneficiary of the said rights, provided that the usufruct rights do not conflict with the public interest or harm the water supply of any population center, and without prejudice to all rights of third parties.

**Article 31** - If the waters of a spring, upon leaving the property where they originate, form a watercourse having the character of running water, the owner of the land may not divert the said waters from their natural course to the detriment of downstream users.

**Article 32** - Private water installations intended to supply private rural holdings are not considered to be of public interest. However, the construction, operation, maintenance, and renewal of said installations shall be regulated by decree.

**Article 33** - Every landowner has the right to use and dispose of the rainwater that falls on their land.
For this purpose, they may benefit from a right of passage through lower-lying lands by the most appropriate and least damaging route. If the use of this water or the direction given to it increases the natural servitude of water flow, an indemnity must be paid to the owner of the lower-lying land.
Disputes arising from the establishment and exercise of the above servitudes and from the payment of indemnities due to the owners of lower-lying lands, where applicable, shall be brought before the civil courts.

**Article 34** - The owner of a lower-lying property is obliged to receive on their land the waters that flow naturally from the higher land, especially rainwater, snowmelt, or un-channelled springs.
No neighbor may obstruct this natural flow to the detriment of another neighbor.

**Article 35** - The owner of a lower-lying property must accept water resulting from the drainage of a higher-lying property if it flows onto their land naturally.
In the event of damage, they may demand that the owner of the higher-lying property, at the latter's expense, construct a channel across the lower-lying land.

**Article 36** - Any natural or legal person who, for the benefit of their holdings, wishes to use water for which they have obtained a usufruct right may obtain passage for this water in underground conduits through intermediate lands, under the most appropriate conditions and those least damaging to the current and future use of the lands, provided that a fair and prior indemnity is paid to the owners of the intermediate lands.
Disputes that may arise from the establishment of servitudes or that result from determining the route, size, and shape of the water conduit, and the indemnities to be paid, whether to the owner of the crossed land or to the owner of the land that receives the water, fall under the jurisdiction of the courts. Such disputes concerning indemnities shall suspend the works.
The same servitudes may be claimed, under the same conditions, for water used for irrigation and for drainage and sanitation canals.
Houses, courtyards, enclosed gardens, parks, and pens adjoining dwellings are exempt from these rights.

**Article 37** - Used water from dwellings and holdings supplied with water may be directed via an underground conduit towards treatment or disposal facilities under the same conditions and reservations as for water conveyance.

**Article 38** - Any landowner wishing to drain their land by means of water discharge or by any other drying method may, under the same conditions and reservations as stipulated in Article 37 of this Code, direct groundwater or surface water across the lands separating this land from a watercourse or from any other means of flow.
Houses, courtyards, enclosed gardens, parks, and pens adjoining dwellings are exempt from this servitude.

**Article 39** - Owners of land adjacent to or crossed by water are entitled to use the works carried out in accordance with the preceding article for the flow of water from their lands.
In this case, they shall bear:
1.  A proportional share of the value of the works from which they benefit.
2.  The expenses resulting from the modifications that this diversion may necessitate.
3.  For the future, a contributory share in the maintenance of the works that have become common in nature.

#### **TITLE FOUR**
#### **Servitudes**

**Article 40** - The banks of wadis, lakes, and salt flats designated by decree are subject to a servitude known as the free bank servitude, within a width of three meters from the bank. This right is intended solely to permit the free passage of administration personnel and their equipment and does not confer any right to indemnity.
No new construction, fencing, or planting shall be carried out within the areas subject to the servitude without prior authorization from the Minister of Agriculture.

**Article 41** - If the free bank servitude proves insufficient for the establishment of a path along the watercourse, the administration may, in the absence of express consent from the adjacent landowners, acquire the necessary land through expropriation for public utility.

**Article 43** - It is prohibited for any owner to erect any construction within the limits of the free banks. However, structures existing prior to the date of the decree provided for in Article 5 of this Code concerning the boundaries of the free banks may be maintained and repaired, provided that their volume is not increased and that the materials used are the same as those previously employed.

**Article 44** - The right-of-way for the operation and maintenance of conveyance aqueducts and conduits shall be determined by the Minister of Agriculture.
This zone, the boundaries of which shall be clearly marked on site, may be subject to expropriation for public utility or to temporary occupation.
In the latter case, the concerned landowners are required to allow the installation of conveyance aqueducts, pipes, canals, or drains on their lands in return for global compensation for the damage caused to them, if these works cannot be executed otherwise and without excessive expense.

**Article 45** - Except with authorization from the Ministry of Agriculture, it is prohibited to carry out any planting within the right-of-way of canals and conveyance aqueducts or to undertake any cultivation in the same area if it concerns unfenced land.

**Article 49** - The servitude obliges the owners and their successors to refrain from any act likely to compromise the proper functioning, maintenance, and preservation of the installations.

**Article 50** - Landowners adjacent to irrigation or drainage canals declared to be of public utility by the administration are obliged to allow the free passage and use of mechanical equipment intended for maintenance work on their lands, within a width of four meters from the bank of the drainage or irrigation canal. They must also allow the deposit of cleaning materials in certain places.
The area subject to the servitude may, in said places, reach double the width between the free banks of the irrigation or drainage canal. In the absence of an amicable sale, the expropriation of lands subject to the servitude of deposit becomes mandatory.
New constructions, the erection of permanent fences within the areas subject to the servitude of passage or deposit, as well as plantings, are subject to prior authorization from the Minister of Agriculture.

**Article 51** - Any owner of land subject to a servitude of deposit may at any time demand that the beneficiary of the said right purchase the land.
If this request is not met within one year, the owner may bring a legal action before the courts to obtain a judgment ordering the transfer of ownership and determining the amount of the indemnity.
The indemnity shall be calculated in the same manner as for expropriation for public utility.

Buildings, courtyards, and enclosed gardens adjacent to dwellings are exempt from these servitudes.

**Article 77** - The execution of works of public utility by the State confers the benefit of the servitudes provided for in the preceding article without the need for a concession document.

**Article 78** - In the absence of an amicable agreement with the landowners, the concession holder may be authorized by an order from the Minister of Agriculture to benefit from the servitudes specified in Article 76 of this Code, after the said landowners have been heard.
The landowners shall be notified of the authorization order by an extrajudicial act by the concession holder. In all cases, the landowner is entitled to a prior indemnity, the calculation of which, in the absence of an amicable agreement, shall be determined according to the following provisions:
*   If the works performed are of a temporary nature, the indemnity shall be paid as an indivisible annual amount, which must not exceed double the rental value of the occupied lands at the time of their occupation.
*   If the occupation lasts for more than three years, or if the occupied lands are no longer suitable, after the completion of the works, for the purpose for which they were previously intended, the owner may demand that the concession holder purchase the land.
*   Parcels that are severely damaged, spoiled over a large part of their area, or of which only a very small area remains unoccupied, preventing their use, must be purchased in their entirety if the owner so demands.
The purchase price shall be determined by agreement between the parties. In the absence of an amicable agreement, the said price shall be determined by the court, which, in its assessment of the price, must take into account the increases in value from which the remaining parts of the occupied property directly and specifically benefit or have benefited.
The judgments rendered in this matter are always enforceable with the deposit of a provisional sum, regardless of appeal. The occupation may take place as soon as the amount of the determined indemnity has been deposited.
However, the concession holder may, through summary proceedings, request immediate occupation of the lands indicated in the authorization order in return for depositing a provisional sum on account of the amount of the disputed indemnity.
