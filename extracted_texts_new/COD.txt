PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC

Law No. 15/026 of 31 December 2015 on water

Statement of Reasons

The Democratic Republic of Congo is rich in significant potential in water resources and aquatic ecosystems, the management, protection, and development of which are subject to new challenges posed by sustainable development, the fight against poverty, and climate change.

Furthermore, the population's access to potable water remains a challenge to be addressed. It is therefore necessary to establish new policies and efficient management schemes at both the resource and public water service levels, in order to develop water not only as an economic resource but also to consider it as a social good, as one of the essential roles of water remains the preservation of life.

To date, the legal framework for the water sector consists of disparate texts, the majority of which deal with the management of waters, lakes, and watercourses, the protection of springs, watercourses, and lakes, and the delimitation of the territorial sea. These texts are ill-suited and have shortcomings regarding their applicability in relation to the provisions of the Constitution in force.

This law is based on Articles 9 and 48 of the Constitution. It also includes the provisions of Articles 203, point 16, and 204, point 26, relating to concurrent and exclusively devolved constitutional powers of the provinces, while also respecting the universal principles of water resources management and public water service.

Its objectives are as follows:

To respond to the obligation prescribed to the State by Articles 9 and 48 of the Constitution as recalled above;

To establish the rules for the sustainable and equitable management of water resources;

To establish the rules of responsibility relating to the public water service and sanitation by adapting them to the current requirements of the country's economic and social development;

To determine the necessary instruments for the rational and balanced management of the water heritage, according to a multisectoral approach that takes into account present and future needs;

To resolve the problem of an inadequate legal and institutional framework as well as the low rate of access to potable water;

To protect the water resource and regulate its use;

To make the sector more efficient;

To attract, through security measures, investors to the sector and promote a national water emergence by resorting to the public-private partnership formula.

In addition, it specifically reinforces the requirements for an environmental and social impact assessment prior to the concession and withdrawal of water resources. It establishes a legal regime based on declaration, authorization, and concession. It also institutes the principle of prior consultation of the Congolese people by referendum for any transfer of fresh water outside the national territory.

The legislation in force in the Democratic Republic of Congo advocates the principles of decentralization, equitable access for all to natural resources, the disengagement of the State, and the transformation of public enterprises. It consequently encourages private initiative in the socio-economic sector. These new dimensions allow the Democratic Republic of Congo to redeploy its responsibilities, in accordance with the new institutional landscape provided for by this law.

The important innovations introduced within the framework of this law include, in particular:

The emphasis on the priority uses of water and taking into account the option chosen by the government to further develop high-growth sectors;

The coverage of the water needs of all categories of consumers;

The creation of a framework establishing clear tariff rules according to the principles of price truth, equality, equity, and non-transferability of charges;

The establishment of a mechanism for settling disputes in the classification of certain acts as special criminal offenses and their subsequent repression with a view to the effective application of the law;

The protection of consumers with regard to the potability of water;

The obligation of environmental protection for all projects in the development of the sector.

This law is structured around 10 titles, namely:

Title I: GENERAL PROVISIONS

Title II: SOVEREIGNTY, OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE, AND THE PUBLIC WATER DOMAIN

Title III: MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

Title IV: WATER USES

Title V: THE PUBLIC WATER SERVICE

Title VI: PROTECTION OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS

Title VII: DISASTER MANAGEMENT

Title VIII: CONFLICT RESOLUTION MECHANISMS

Title IX: PENAL PROVISIONS

Title X: TRANSITIONAL, REPEALING, AND FINAL PROVISIONS.

Such is the general structure of this law.

Section 3: Protection of Continental Waters

Paragraph 1: Easements (Servitudes)

Article 40
The riparian properties of a watercourse or a lake are encumbered, on each bank, with a public utility easement of a width of 100 meters from the banks, known as the free access easement, intended to allow the mobility of dredging and maintenance equipment and for the water administration to install means of signaling, measurement, and survey.

Article 41
The holder of a real property right or any person having the enjoyment of a property encumbered with easements is required to refrain from any act that could harm the object for which the easement was established.

Article 42
The lower properties, known as servient properties, are required, towards the higher properties, known as dominant properties, to receive the waters that flow naturally from them.

The holder of a real property right on the servient property may not erect any obstacle that prevents this flow.

The holder of a real property right on the dominant property may not do anything that aggravates the easement of the lower property.

Article 43
Any person may, to evacuate the waters found on their property, conduct them underground or in the open air through the lands that separate this property from a lake, a watercourse, or any other drainage channel.

In the case where the passage could be made through different properties, the choice shall fall on the one that would cause the least possible damage.

Article 44
When, by drilling or underground works, an occupant causes water to spring up from their property, the holder of the right on the lower property is required to receive it.

However, the latter is entitled to compensation in case of damage resulting from the easement of flow, in accordance with the law.

Article 45
A joint order of the ministers responsible for land affairs and urbanism in their attributions shall establish the conditions and modalities for the establishment of the easements above, the rights of the State or the concessionaire of the property to which the easement is due, as well as the causes and modalities for the extinction of these easements.

Paragraph 2: Protection Areas and Perimeters

Article 46
Protection areas are established around springs, watercourses or parts of watercourses, dam reservoirs, lakes, ponds, groundwater abstraction zones and, in general, bodies of water intended at least partially for human or animal consumption.
These areas are also established to protect the recharge zones of groundwater tables.

For the purpose of water abstraction for consumption, protection perimeters, as a measure of public health, are mandatory.

Article 47
There are three types of protection perimeters:
a) The immediate protection perimeter;
b) The close protection perimeter;
c) The remote protection perimeter.

The limits of these perimeters are determined, as the case may be, by a provincial order deliberated in the Council of Ministers or by a decision of the executive board of the decentralized territorial entity.

They may be modified if new circumstances so require.

Article 48
The immediate protection perimeter corresponds to the environment close to the place where the abstraction is carried out.
Its main function is to prevent the deterioration of the works and to avoid any discharge of polluting substances in the immediate vicinity of the abstraction.

Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 38 of this law, the properties forming part of this perimeter fall within the domain of the State.

Article 49
Within the close protection perimeters, any deposit, installation, or activity of a nature to directly or indirectly harm the quality of the water or to render it unfit for consumption is prohibited.

The prohibition concerns, in particular, the drilling of exploitation wells, the extraction of mineral substances, and the deposit or spreading of any substance presenting risks of toxicity, such as chemical products, pesticides and fertilizers, garbage, filth, detritus, manure, and hydrocarbons.

Article 50
Remote protection perimeters are established around the points of water abstractions and within which deposits or activities are regulated in order to prevent the dangers of pollution that they present for the abstracted waters.

Section 4: Water Transfer

Article 51
Any transfer of surface or groundwater within the limits of the national territory or outside of it is subject to a prior environmental and social impact assessment, accompanied by its duly approved management plan.

Article 52
Within the limits of the national territory, the transfer of water is integrated into the master plan of the entire hydrographic system or into the master plans relating to the concerned systems prior to its approval by order of the minister responsible for the management of water resources within his attributions.

Article 53
Any transfer of fresh water outside the national territory to the territory of another State is subject to the prior agreement of the Congolese people consulted by referendum in accordance with Article 214, paragraph 2, of the Constitution.

CHAPTER 3: MARITIME WATERS

Article 54
Any immersion of noxious and/or radioactive substances likely to endanger human health, harm biological resources, marine fauna and flora, impair amenities, or hinder any other legitimate uses of the sea and territorial waters is prohibited.

Article 55
For the purposes of Article 54 of this law, immersion means any deliberate disposal into the sea and territorial waters of substances and materials from or by means of any installation or vessel, other than:
a) Discharge that is incidental to or results from the normal operation of ships, vessels, and aircraft or their equipment;
b) Discharge that results from industrial activities at sea;
c) The deposit of substances and materials for purposes other than their mere disposal, provided that it is not incompatible with the provisions of this law and its implementing measures.

Article 56
The prohibition referred to in Article 54 of this law does not apply:
a) To discharges at sea in the context of operations to combat marine pollution by hydrocarbons carried out by the competent national authorities or by any person authorized by them;
b) To discharges caused as a result of a case of force majeure.

CHAPTER 4: TRANSBOUNDARY WATERS

Article 57
The State shall conclude with the riparian States of watercourses and transboundary waters bilateral or multilateral agreements or other arrangements in order to define mutual relations regarding the use, development, and protection of water resources and aquatic ecosystems in an equitable manner.

This cooperation aims in particular at:
a) The exchange of information and data;
b) The integrated and sustainable management of transboundary waters;
c) The implementation of joint programs and projects and of bi- or multilateral structures for the management of shared waters;
d) Capacity building;
e) The coordination of actions aimed at serving common objectives and interests in regional and international forums relating to the management and protection of water resources.

These agreements also cover the course of action to be taken in emergency situations or for the prevention, control, and reduction of any pollution that may have a transboundary impact.

TITLE V: THE PUBLIC WATER SERVICE

CHAPTER 1: GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Article 70
The public water service falls under the authority of the central government, the province, and the decentralized territorial entity, each within the limits of its powers and attributions.

Article 71
The government defines the national policy for the public water service. It ensures its implementation with the provincial government and the executive board of the decentralized territorial entity.

This policy conforms to the principles of equality and equity among users, continuity, and adaptation of services to the evolution of needs.

Article 72
The provincial government and the executive board of the decentralized territorial entity assume, within the limits of their respective powers and attributions, the responsibilities of the contracting authority.

The contracting authority is responsible for the development, rehabilitation, and extension of the installations and services.

It ensures that all necessary measures for their protection, proper functioning, and maintenance are implemented.

Article 73
In the case of autonomous public water supply service networks, developed water sources and points, and single-point abstraction installations, particularly wells and boreholes with or without a hand pump, the responsibility of the contracting authority is devolved to users' associations or local water committees.

A provincial order deliberated in the Council of Ministers shall establish the modalities of execution.

CHAPTER 2: MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR THE PUBLIC WATER SERVICE

Article 78
The province, as the decentralized territorial entity and contracting authority, is not authorized to operate the public water service under direct management.

Public or private companies and establishments, or users' associations, as project managers, ensure the provision of services, the management, and the maintenance of the installations within the framework of management agreements.

The province and the decentralized territorial entity, each within the limits of its powers and attributions, may delegate the project management for the development of the installations within the framework of management agreements.

Article 79
The management agreements for the public water service cover different modes: concession, leasing (affermage), or management contract (gérance), as well as any variant or combination of these three modes.

The management agreement for the public water service defines its object, its duration, its territorial scope, and the mutual obligations. A set of specifications is attached to it.

A provincial order shall specify the modes of conventional management, the procedures and conditions of attribution, as well as the modalities of regulation and control of the public water service, in conformity with the national policy on the matter.

Article 80
Any natural or legal, public or private person, responsible for the supply of potable water, shall ensure that the water is in conformity with potability standards. It shall put in place adequate internal means for monitoring its quality.

An order of the ministers responsible respectively for public health and the determination of standards within their attributions shall establish the potability standards for water.

Article 81
In rural and peri-urban areas, the management of the public water service may be ensured by a users' association endowed with legal personality.

Article 82
The management associations of a public water service shall collect the fees for the provision of services, the surveillance, maintenance, and use of the works and installations for which they take the initiative and/or ensure the management.

Article 83
In the event of the failure of the manager, the contracting authority shall take measures to replace them.

In the absence of a replacement, the contracting authority may, on an exceptional basis, proceed with the operation under direct management, the duration of which may not exceed twelve months.

CHAPTER 3: THE PRICE OF THE PUBLIC WATER SERVICE

Article 84
The public water service is accessible to all.
It is not free of charge.
Its price is determined by a tariff.

Water consumption tariffs are calculated in a transparent manner, in order to cover all the costs borne by their managers, without, however, exceeding the authorized costs.

Article 85
Water tariffs are established according to the principles of price truth, equality, equity, and non-transferability of charges, which may be subject to an audit.

Price truth consists in the tariffs reflecting all costs, including the operating costs incurred for the supply of consumers with water. These costs are accounted for in a clear and transparent manner and are verified by the regulatory authority.

Equality consists in the tariffs representing, for each category of consumers, the costs incurred for their water supply.

Equity consists in the tariffs being deemed acceptable for each category of consumers.

Non-transferability consists in the tariffs reflecting the structure of the costs incurred according to the different levels of consumption.

Article 86
A joint order of the ministers responsible respectively for the public water service and the economy within their attributions shall determine the rules and modalities for setting and revising the tariffs applicable by the operators of the water service.

Article 87
The new tariffs are proposed by the operator to the regulatory authority of the public water service which, after analysis and opinion, submits them, within a period of fifteen days, to the ministers responsible for the economy and the public water service within their attributions.

In the absence of a duly motivated contrary opinion, and after this period, the tariffs proposed by the operator are submitted directly to the ministers for decision.

The inter-ministerial decision is deemed acquired, unless there is a duly motivated opposition from one of the ministers within a period of thirty days following the reception of the proposals from the regulatory authority of the water sector, or directly from the operator, as the case may be.

The authorized tariffs are published in the official journal by the regulatory authority of the public water service.

Article 88
Any sale of water is invoiced on the basis of the actual consumption recorded by calibrated and properly functioning meters.
Any flat-rate invoicing is prohibited.

Article 89
The provincial government and the executive board of the decentralized territorial entity shall implement the tariffing as defined in Article 86 of this law.

CHAPTER 4: SANITATION OF AGGLOMERATIONS

Article 91
The sanitation of agglomerations includes the works, structures, and measures aimed at ensuring the rapid and complete evacuation of rainwater as well as domestic and industrial wastewater likely to cause nuisances.

It also includes their eventual treatment and recycling under conditions that can satisfy the requirements of public health, the preservation of the water resource, and the environment.

Article 92
In agglomerations equipped with a collective sanitation network, the connection to the sewer of any dwelling or establishment discharging water is mandatory.

The conditions and deadlines for the application of the provisions of this article are established by regulation.

In the case where, in their raw state, the residual waters are likely to affect the proper functioning of the public sanitation network and the purification installations, their pre-treatment, before discharge, is mandatory.

Article 95
In areas where housing is dispersed or in agglomerations not equipped with a collective sanitation network, the evacuation of wastewater and rainwater is carried out by means of individual evacuation installations.

The standards relating to these installations and the monitoring measures are defined by a provincial order deliberated in the Council of Ministers.

Article 96
The management of the public sanitation service may be entrusted in whole or in part to any natural or legal, public or private person according to the conditions defined in Articles 78 and 79 relating to the management agreement for the public potable water service.
