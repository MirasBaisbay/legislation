**Explanatory Memorandum**
**For Law No. (42) of 2014**
**Concerning the Issuance of the Environmental Protection Law**

Despite the efforts made to protect the environment and preserve its natural resources in the State of Kuwait, there is an ambition to continuously develop and improve performance for the optimal use and conservation of resources, especially after the damage they sustained as a result of the brutal aggression from military operations and other factors. To limit environmental pollution, conserve various natural resources, address different environmental problems, achieve continuous development, and integrate the environmental element into organizational structures, this law concerning environmental protection has been prepared. It addresses general provisions in its first chapter. The law has adopted the definition of environmental protection as the measures and policies...

The Committee approved the observations made regarding the preliminary chapter on some technical terms, so it approved the addition of several terms to the text of the first article as follows: Indoor Environment, Work Environment, Ozone Layer, Ground-Level Ozone, Ozone-Depleting Substances, Greenhouse Gases, Climate Change, Integrated Coastal Zone Management, Natural Resources, Biodiversity, The Competent Minister, Environmental Inspection, Sewage, Sewage Treatment Plants, Sludge, Industrial Effluent, Solid Municipal Waste, Landfills, Hazardous Waste, Medical Waste, Nuclear Waste, Radioactivity Level, Hazardous Substances.

In the second chapter, it addressed the scope of application and objectives of the law, while the third chapter outlined how to manage environmental affairs by establishing a Supreme Council for the Environment chaired by the Prime Minister or one of his deputies, with the membership of a number of ministers chosen by the Chairman of the Supreme Council, in addition to establishing a public authority concerned with environmental affairs with an independent legal personality called the (Environment Public Authority), as well as establishing an Environment Protection Fund. In the first part of the law, it addressed development and the environment, explaining in its first chapter the environmental impact of development projects, and in the second chapter, it spoke about the work environment and the indoor environment.

The second part dealt with the protection of the terrestrial environment from pollution, and the third part spoke about the protection of the external air from pollution through the Environment Public Authority carrying out continuous monitoring and evaluation operations and preparing research and studies to preserve the quality of the external air from the harmful effects resulting from the emission of polluting gases.

The fourth part dealt with the protection of the marine and coastal environment from pollution by imposing penalties on anyone who commits or causes any act that pollutes the marine environment with harmful substances, with the exception of warships and means of transport in their service.

The fifth part spoke about biodiversity, as Article (100) stipulated a ban on hunting, killing, catching, collecting, harming, possessing, or transporting endangered wild terrestrial and marine species, whether alive or dead, or interfering with their young, eggs, or nests. Article (101) stipulated a ban on trafficking in endangered species or any part thereof. In the second chapter of this part, it spoke about natural reserves.

The sixth part dealt with environmental management, and the seventh part dealt with penalties for those who violate the application of this law.
