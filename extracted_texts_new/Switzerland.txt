Art. 5  
Exemptions for reasons of national defence or emergencies 
If required in the interests of national defence or in the event of emergencies, the Fed-
eral Council may, by ordinance, provide for exemptions from the provisions of this 
Act.  
Title 2 
Prevention and Remediation of Detrimental Effects 
Chapter 1 
Maintaining the Quality of Waters 
Section 1 
Discharge, Introduction and Infiltration of Substances 
Art. 6  
Principle 
1 It is prohibited to introduce into a body of water, either directly or indirectly any 
substances which may pollute it; the infiltration of such substances is also prohibited. 
2 It is also prohibited to store or spread such substances outside a body of water if 
there is a genuine risk of water pollution. 
Art. 7 
Disposal of waste water 
1 Polluted waste water must be treated. It may only be discharged or infiltrated into a 
body of water with the authorisation of the cantonal authority. 
2 Non-polluted waste water must be discharged by infiltration according to the instruc-
tions of the cantonal authority. If local conditions do not permit this, such non-polluted 
water may be discharged into surface waters; in this case retention measures must be 
taken if possible so as to ensure a steady discharge in the event of high inflow. The 
discharge of water that is not shown on a communal drainage plan approved by the 
canton requires the consent of the cantonal authority.6 
3 The cantons shall arrange the drawing up of communal and, if required, regional 
drainage plans.7 
Art. 88 
Art. 9 
Federal Council regulations on the discharge and infiltration of 
substances 
1 The Federal Council shall specify the water quality requirements for surface and 
underground waters.

2 It shall enact regulations on: 
a. 
the discharge of waste water into bodies of water; 
b. 
the infiltration of waste water; 
c. 
substances which may according to the method of their use enter into water 
and which, by reason of their properties or the quantities used, risk polluting 
waters or impairing the operation of waste water treatment plants. 
3 An authorisation for plant protection products and biocidal products (pesticides) 
must be reviewed if: 
a.  the limit value of 0.1 µg/l for pesticides or their degradation products is re-
peatedly and widely exceeded in waters used or intended for use for drinking 
water; or 
b.  the ecotoxicological limit values for pesticides are repeatedly and widely ex-
ceeded in surface waters.9 
4 The new decision on authorisation must ensure compliance with the limit values.10 
5 If it is not possible to achieve compliance with the limit values by imposing condi-
tions of use, the authorisation for the pesticides in question or, in the case of plant 
protection products, the approval of their active substances must be withdrawn.11 
6 If a measure under paragraph 5 would seriously reduce domestic supplies of im-
portant agricultural crops, the Federal Council may refrain from withdrawing author-
isation or approval for a limited period of time.12 
 
Section 2 
Treatment of Waste Water and Use of Farm Manure 
Art. 10 
Public sewers and central waste water treatment plants 
1 The cantons shall be responsible for the construction of public sewers and central 
plants for the treatment of polluted waste water: 
a. 
from building zones; 
b. 
from existing groups of buildings outside building zones for which the special 
procedures for the disposal of waste water (Art. 13) provide insufficient pro-
tection for waters or are not economically viable.

1bis They shall ensure that these plants are operated economically.13 
2 In isolated or sparsely inhabited regions, polluted waste water must be treated by 
systems other than central waste water treatment plants provided that the protection 
of surface and underground waters is guaranteed. 
3 If private sewers also serve the public interest, their status is equal to that of public 
sewers.

Art. 11 
Duty to connect to sewers and to accept polluted waste water 
1 Polluted waste water which originates in an area served by public sewers shall be 
discharged into such sewers. 
2 The areas served by public sewers shall include: 
a. 
building zones; 
b.  other zones as soon as they are connected to the public sewers (Art. 10 para. 
1, let. b); 
c.  other zones where connection to the public sewers is expedient and reasona-
ble. 
3 The person responsible for the sewers is obliged to accept waste water and convey 
it to the appropriate central waste water treatment plant. 
Art. 12 
Special cases in areas covered by public sewers 
1 Those responsible for waste water which does not meet the requirements laid down 
for discharge into the drainage system must subject such waste water to pre-treatment. 
Such pre-treatment shall be regulated by the cantons. 
2 The cantonal authorities shall decide on the appropriate way to dispose of waste 
water which is not suited for treatment by a central water treatment plant. 
3 Non-polluted waste water with permanent flow shall not be passed through a central 
waste water treatment plant either directly or indirectly. The cantonal authorities may 
authorise exceptions to this rule. 
4 In a farm comprising a substantial stock of cattle or pigs, domestic waste water may 
be used agriculturally together with the liquid manure (Art. 14) provided that: 
a. 
residential or industrial buildings and their adjoining land are situated in an 
area classified as an agricultural zone or the communal authority is taking the 
necessary measures, particularly in the field of area planning, to classify the 
buildings and their adjoining land in an agricultural zone;

b.  storage capacity is sufficient for domestic waste water too and the waste water 
is used on land which is either owned or leased by the farm in question. 
5 If the residential or industrial buildings and their adjoining land in accordance with 
Art. 4 are not allocated to an agricultural zone within five years, domestic waste water 
must be discharged into the public sewers. 
Art. 13 
Special procedures for the disposal of waste water 
1 Outside areas covered by public sewers, waste water shall be disposed of by state-
of-the art methods. 
2 The cantons shall ensure that water quality requirements are respected. 
Art. 14 
Animal husbandry farms 
1 All animal husbandry farms must attempt to balance their use of manure. 
2 Farm manure shall be used in agriculture and horticulture in an environmentally 
compatible way and according to the state-of-the-art. 
3 The farm must have storage facilities with a capacity for at least three months. How-
ever, the cantonal authorities may require a higher storage capacity for establishments 
situated in mountain areas or in areas with unfavourable climatic or special crop grow-
ing conditions. Lower storage capacities may also be authorised for buildings which 
are occupied by livestock for only short periods of time. 
4 A maximum of three livestock units of manure may be spread on 1 ha of agricultural 
land. If part of the farm manure is used outside the normal local farming area, the 
number of animals kept must be such that at least half the manure produced by the 
farm may be used on the agricultural land owned or leased.15 
5 Farms that provide manure must record each delivery in the information system in 
accordance with Article 165f of the Agriculture Act of 29 April 199816.17 
6 The cantonal authorities shall reduce the number of livestock units of manure per-
mitted per hectare if the pollutant-bearing capacity of the soil, the altitude and topo-
graphical conditions so require. 
7 The Federal Council may authorise exceptions to the requirements for agricultural 
land in cases of: 
a. 
poultry and horse-stabling farms, as well as other already existing small or 
medium-sized animal husbandry farms; 
b. 
farms serving the public interest (waste recovery, research, etc.). 
8 One livestock unit of manure corresponds to the average annual production of liquid 
and solid manure by one cow weighing 600 kg.

 Art. 18 
Exceptions 
1 In the case of small buildings and installations in an area served by public sewers 
but which for overriding reasons cannot be immediately connected to such sewers, a 
building permit may be granted where it is possible to provide the connection in the 
short term and that in the meantime the waste water may be disposed of in another 
satisfactory manner. Before the authority grants a building permit in such circum-
stances, it shall consult with the cantonal water protection agency. 
2 The Federal Council may define the exceptions in greater detail. 
 
Section 4

Art. 19 
Water protection areas 
1 The cantons shall divide their territory into water protection areas according to the 
risks of pollution to which surface and underground waters are subject. The Federal 
Council shall enact the required regulations. 
2 In areas which are particularly vulnerable, the construction and conversion of build-
ings and installations as well as operations such as excavations, earthworks and simi-
lar works may take place only provided that a cantonal permit has been granted if they 
may pose a risk to the waters.20 
Art. 20 
Groundwater protection zones 
1 The cantons shall determine protection zones for groundwater wells and recharge 
installations serving the public interest; they shall lay down any limitations on prop-
erty rights which may be required to this effect. 
2 The persons responsible for groundwater wells must: 
a.  carry out the surveys necessary to establish the boundaries of protection 
zones; 
b.  acquire the necessary rights in rem; 
c.  bear the cost, where applicable, of compensation paid in respect of limitations 
on property rights.

Section 5 
Handling Liquids which may pollute Water 
Art. 2221 
General Requirements 
1 The persons responsible for installations for handling liquids which may pollute wa-
ter must ensure that the structures and equipment required for the protection of the 
waters are provided, regularly inspected and properly operated and maintained. Stor-
age installations that require a permit (Art. 19 para. 2) must be inspected at least every 
ten years; depending on the risk of pollution to the waters, the Federal Council may 
stipulate inspection intervals for other installations. 
2 Losses of liquid must be prevented at storage installations and transhipment areas 
and leaks of liquid shall be easily detected and retained. 
3 Installations with liquids which may pollute water may only be constructed, modi-
fied, inspected, filled, maintained, emptied and decommissioned by persons who due 
to their training, equipment and experience guarantee compliance with the state of the 
art. 
4 Any person who manufactures parts for installations must test whether these parts 
correspond to the state of the art and document the results of the test. 
5 If installations with liquids which may pollute water are constructed, modified or 
decommissioned, the persons responsible must report this to the canton in accordance 
with cantonal regulations. 
6 If the person responsible for an installation with liquids which may pollute water or 
any person entrusted with the operation or maintenance thereof detects a leak, they 
shall report this immediately to the waters protection inspectorate. They shall, on their 
own initiative, take all reasonable measures to prevent the related pollution of waters. 
7 Paragraphs 2–5 do not apply to installations that do not pose a risk of pollution to 
waters or only do so to a negligible extent  
Art. 2322 
Art. 24 
Storage in man-made caverns 
Liquids which may pollute water may not be stored in underground caverns if they

Section 6 
Soil Use and Measures applying to Waters 
Art. 27 
Soil use 
1 Soils shall be used according to the state of the art, in such a way that waters are not 
adversely affected in any way, in particular avoiding both washing away and leaching 
of fertilisers and plant treatment products. 
1bis In the area of contribution of drinking water wells, only plant protection products 
whose use does not lead to groundwater concentrations of active substances and deg-
radation products exceeding 0.1 µg/l may be used.24 
2 The Federal Council may enact the necessary regulations. 
Art. 28 
Measures applying to waters 
If the measures contained in Articles 7–27 prove insufficient to maintain the water 
quality requirements (Art. 9 para. 1) for a specific body of water, the cantons shall 
ensure that additional measures shall be applied to the body of water itself. 
 
Chapter 2

Art. 29 
Permits 
A permit is required by any person who, over and above normal public use: 
a.  withdraws water from a watercourse with permanent flow; 
b.  withdraws water from lakes or groundwater resources in such a way as to af-
fect substantially the discharge rate of a watercourse with permanent flow. 
Art. 30 
Conditions for the permit 
Such withdrawal may be permitted provided that: 
a.  the requirements contained in Articles 31–35 are complied with;

20 per cent and total withdrawal amounts to not more than 1,000 litres per 
second; or 
c.  for the supply of drinking water, at most 80 litres per second from a spring 
and at most 100 litres per second from groundwater, based on the annual av-
erage, is withdrawn. 
Art. 31 
Minimum residual flow 
1 When withdrawal takes place from a permanently flowing watercourse, the mini-
mum residual flow must be as follows: 
 
up to a flow rate Q347 of 60 l/s  
50 l/s 
   and for each further 10 l/s of flow rate Q347 
8 l/s , 
for a flow rate Q347 of 160 l/s  
130 l/s 
   and for each further 10 l/s of flow rate Q347  
4.4 l/s more, 
for 500 l/s of flow rate Q347

150 l/s more, 
from 60,000 l/s of flow rate Q347
10,000 l/s . 
 
2 The minimum residual flow calculated according to paragraph 1 above shall be in-
creased if the following requirements are not complied with and cannot be complied 
with as a result of other measures: 
a.  The prescribed water quality of the surface waters must be maintained in spite 
of the water withdrawal and existing waste water discharges. 
b.  Groundwater resources must continue to be replenished such that the drinking 
water supply dependent on them remains available to the required extent and 
the water balance of soils used for agriculture is not substantially impaired. 
c.  Rare habitats and biocoenoses which depend directly or indirectly on the type 
and size of a body of water must either be maintained or where possible be 
replaced by others of a similar value unless overriding reasons prevent this. 
d.  The depth of water necessary for free fish migration must be maintained. 
e.  In the case of watercourses with a flow rate Q347 of up to 40 litres per second 
below an altitude of 800 metres above sea level which serve as spawning 
grounds or habitats for juvenile fish, the continuation of these functions must 
be guaranteed. 
Art. 32 
Exceptions 
The cantonal authorities may lay down lower minimum residual flow rates in the fol-
lowing circumstances:

a.25 if the flow rate Q347 of the body of water is lower than 50 l/s: over a 1,000 m 
long stretch below a point of withdrawal from a body of water situated at an 
altitude higher than 1,700 m above sea level or from a body of water not suit-
able as a habitat for fish and situated at an altitude between 1,500 and 1,700 
m above sea level; 
b. 
in the case of water withdrawals from bodies of water not suitable as habitats 
for fish provided that the residual rate of flow represents at least 35 per cent 
of the flow rate Q347; 
bbis.26 on a 1000 m long stretch below a place of withdrawal in sections with neg-
ligible ecological potential, provided the natural functions of the body of wa-
ter are not substantially impaired; 
c. 
in the framework of a protection and utilisation planning for a limited area 
forming a topographical whole, in so far as an appropriate balance can be 
achieved in the same area by specific measures such as refraining from further 
withdrawals; such protection and utilisation plan shall require the approval of 
the Federal Council; 
d. 
in cases of necessity, for withdrawals limited in time, in particular for the sup-
ply of drinking water, for fire-fighting or for agricultural irrigation. 
Art. 33 
Increase of the minimum residual flow 
1 The authorities shall increase the minimum residual flow to the extent which is 
deemed necessary after weighing up the interests for and against the planned water 
withdrawal. 
2 Interests in favour of a water withdrawal are as follows: 
a.  public interests which may be served by the water withdrawal; 
b.  economic interests of the area in which the water originates; 
c.  economic interests of those wishing to withdraw the water; 
d.  energy supply which may be served by the water withdrawal. 
3 Interests against a water withdrawal are as follows: 
a.  the significance of the waters as an element of the landscape; 
b.  the significance of the waters as a natural habitat and for the conservation of 
the diversity of the dependent fauna and flora, in particular of the fish fauna, 
the income derived from fishing and the natural reproduction of fish; 
c.  maintaining a rate of flow sufficient to satisfy the quality requirements of wa-
ters in the long run;

d.  maintaining a balanced groundwater regimen which guarantees future sup-
plies of drinking water, land use customary to the area and vegetation suited 
to the location; 
e.  ensuring agricultural irrigation. 
4 Anyone wishing to withdraw water shall provide the authorities with a report on: 
a.  the consequences of the water withdrawal, calculated at various rates of flow, 
on the interests served by the withdrawal, with particular regard to the pro-
duction of electric energy and its costs; 
b.  the interests which are likely to be adversely affected by the water withdrawal 
and measures which might be taken to prevent such impairment. 
Art. 34 
Water withdrawal from lakes and groundwater resources 
If water is withdrawn from lakes or groundwater resources and the rate of flow of 
watercourses is thereby substantially affected, the watercourses in question must be 
protected as provided for in Articles 31–33. 
Art. 35 
Decision of the authorities 
1 The authorities shall decide in each individual case on the required water endowment 
and any other measures which may be necessary to protect waters below the point of 
withdrawal. 
2 They may specify temporally variable required water endowments. Residual flows 
shall not fall below those specified in Articles 31 and 32. 
3 The authorities shall consult the competent agencies before making their decision; 
in cases where the withdrawals in question concern hydropower plants with gross pro-
duction in excess of 300 kW, they shall also consult the federal government. 
Art. 36 
Control of the required water endowment 
1 Anyone withdrawing water from any body of water shall be required to prove to the 
authorities by means of measurements that he will maintain the required water en-
dowment. If the cost of such a procedure is unreasonable, evidence may be provided 
by a calculation based on the water balance. 
2 If he proves that the effective rate of flow is temporarily lower than the required 
water endowment, he is only obliged to maintain a required water endowment equal 
of the effective rate of flow during the period in which such a situation exists.

c. 
the use of the waters. 
2 The Federal Council shall regulate the details. 
3 The cantons shall ensure that that space provided for waters is taken into account in 
structure and land use planning and that it is developed and exploited extensively. The 
space provided for waters does not constitute arable land. In the event of a loss of 
arable land, this must be compensated for as specified in the federal sectoral plan in 
accordance with Article 13 of the Spatial Planning Act of 22 June 197929. 
Art. 37 
The artificial reinforcement and correction of watercourses 
1 Watercourses may be channelled or straightened only provided that: 
a.30 the protection of persons or substantial material values requires it (Art. 3 para. 
2, of the Federal Act of 21 June 199131 on Hydraulic Engineering); 
b.  it is necessary for the provision of navigable passage or for the use of hydro-
power in the public interest; 
bbis.32 it is necessary for the construction of a landfill that can only be constructed 
at the planned location and in which only unpolluted excavation material, 
quarried material or spoil is deposited; 
c.  the condition of an already channelled or straightened watercourse may be 
improved in terms of this Act. 
2 The natural course of the body of water must wherever possible be preserved or 
restored. Waters and the space provided for waters must be developed in such a man-

Art. 38a34 
Rehabilitation of waters 
1 The cantons shall ensure that waters are rehabilitated. In doing so, they take account 
of the benefits to nature and the landscape as well as the economic consequences of 
the rehabilitation. 
2 They shall plan the rehabilitation measures and specify the time schedule therefor. 
They shall ensure that these plans are taken into account in the structure and land use

3 The embankments created shall be as natural as possible, and all bank flora destroyed 
shall be replaced. 
Art. 39a36 
Hydropeaking 
1 Those responsible for hydropower plants must prevent or eliminate by means of civil 
engineering measures short-term artificial changes in the water flow on a body of wa-
ter (hydropeaking) that cause serious harm to the indigenous flora and fauna as well 
as their habitats. At the request of the person responsible for a hydropower plant, the 
authority may order operational instead of civil engineering measures. 
2 The measures are determined by: 
a. 
the degree of harm caused to the body of water; 
b. 
the ecological potential of the body of water; 
c. 
the proportionality of the cost; 
d. 
the interests of flood protection; 
e. 
the energy policy goals relating to the promotion of renewable energy sources. 
3 Within the catchment area of the body of water concerned, the measures must be 
coordinated with each other after hearing the persons responsible for the hydropower 
plants concerned. 
4 Retention basins constructed in application of paragraph 1 may be used for pumped 
storage without modification of the licence. 
Art. 40 
Flushing out and emptying of impoundments 
1 The person responsible for a dam shall as far as possible ensure that in flushing or 
emptying an impoundment or when inspecting drainage and flood overflow structures, 
downstream fauna and flora are not harmed. 
2 Flushing and emptying shall take place only with the authorisation of the cantonal 
authority. The licensing authority shall consult interested specialist agencies. If peri-
odical flushing and emptying are required in order to maintain operational safety, the 
authority shall fix only the times and types of such operations. 
3 If a person responsible is obliged to lower the water level of a reservoir on safety 
grounds as a result of exceptional events, he shall immediately inform the responsible 
authority. 
Art. 41 
Flotsam at dams 
1 Anyone who dams up a watercourse may not put any flotsam which he may have 
removed for operational reasons back into the water. The authority may grant excep-
tions.

2 The person responsible for a dam must periodically collect the flotsam near his in-
stallation according to the instructions of the authority. 
Art. 42 
Withdrawal and discharge of fresh water or used water 
1 If water is withdrawn from or discharged into a natural lake, the stratification and 
flow conditions in the lake may not be substantially modified, and no water-level fluc-
tuations potentially harmful to the riparian zone may be allowed to occur. 
2 In the case of watercourses, the type and location of the discharge of fresh water or 
waste water must be selected in such a way that as little artificial reinforcement and 
correction as possible is required. 
Art. 43 
Conservation of groundwater resources 
1 The cantons shall ensure that over the long term no more water is withdrawn from 
groundwater resources than flows into them. In the short term, more water may be 
withdrawn unless this impairs the quality of groundwater or the vegetation. 
2 If a groundwater resource is impaired as a result of excessive withdrawal or through 
reduced recharge, the canton shall ensure that the situation is remedied as far as pos-
sible, either through reducing the rate of withdrawal or by artificial recharge or by 
underground storage of drinking water. 
3 Different groundwater resources may not be connected to each other on a permanent 
basis if such a connection may impair the quantity or quality of the groundwater. 
4 Storage volumes and flows of usable groundwater resources may not be substantially 
reduced on a permanent basis as a result of new installations of any kind. 
5 Low dams shall not substantially impair the groundwater nor the vegetation which 
depends on the groundwater level. The authority may grant exceptions for existing 
installations. 
6 Drainage of a zone which results in a lowering of the groundwater table over a large 
area shall be permitted only if agricultural utilisation cannot be ensured in any other 
way. 
Art. 43a37 
Bed load budget 
1 The bed load budget in the body of water may not be changed by installations to the 
extent that they cause serious harm to the indigenous flora and fauna, their habitats, 
the groundwater regimen and flood protection. The persons responsible for the instal-
lations shall take suitable measures to this end. 
2 The measures are determined by: 
a. 
the degree of harm caused to the body of water; 
b. 
the ecological potential of the body of water;

Extraction of gravel, sand and other materials 
1 Anyone wishing to extract gravel, sand or other materials or to carry out preparatory 
excavations for such extraction requires a permit. 
2 Permits for such work may not be granted: 
a.  in groundwater protection zones; 
b.  below the groundwater table of groundwater resources whose amount and 
quality are suitable for water supply; 
c.  for watercourses where the bed load budget may be negatively affected. 
3 For groundwater resources whose amount and quality are suitable for water supply, 
extraction may be permitted above groundwater level, provided a protective layer of 
material is left above the maximum groundwater table possible. The dimension of this 
protective layer shall be chosen according to the local conditions.

the nature and volume of the waste water produced; 
b. 
the depreciation required to preserve the value of the installations; 
c. 
the interest; 
d. 
the planned investment requirements for maintenance, improvements and re-
placements, for adaptation to statutory requirements and for operational opti-
misation.

be remediated below the point of withdrawal according to the instructions of the au-
thorities in so far as is possible without infringing existing water use rights to the 
extent of justifying a claim for compensation by the user. 
2 The authorities shall order more extensive remediation measures in cases which con-
cern watercourses situated in landscapes or including habitats which are listed in na-
tional or cantonal inventories, or in cases where overriding public interests require it. 
The procedures for ascertaining whether compensation must be paid and for fixing 
their amount shall be based on the procedures contained in the Compulsory Purchase 
Act of 20 June 193098. 
3 If small hydro-electric power plants or other installations on waters of historic value

b.  the residual flow; 
c.  the required water endowment; 
d.  the legal situation. 
2 They shall evaluate the water withdrawals listed in the inventory and adjudicate 
whether and to what extent remediation is necessary. Their findings shall take the 
form of a report. As far as possible this shall include the time-spans over which reme-
diation must be completed.
