Regulation of water relations is carried out based on the concept of a water body as a crucial component of the environment, a habitat for objects of the animal and plant world, including aquatic biological resources, as a natural resource used by humans for personal and domestic needs and for conducting economic and other activities, and simultaneously as an object of the right of ownership and other rights;
2) the priority of protecting water bodies over their use. The use of water bodies must not have a negative impact on the environment;
3) the preservation of specially protected water bodies, the restriction or prohibition of the use of which is established by federal laws;
4) the designated use of water bodies. Water bodies may be used for one or several purposes;
5) the priority of using water bodies for drinking and domestic water supply purposes over other purposes of their use. Granting them for use for other purposes is permitted only if sufficient water resources are available;
6) the participation of citizens and public associations in resolving issues concerning rights to water bodies, as well as their duties for the protection of water bodies. Citizens and public associations have the right to participate in the preparation of decisions, the implementation of which may have an impact on water bodies during their use and protection. State authorities, local self-government bodies, and subjects of economic and other activities are obliged to ensure the possibility of such participation in the manner and in the forms established by the legislation of the Russian Federation;
7) equal access for natural persons and legal entities to acquiring the right to use water bodies, except in cases provided for by water legislation;
8) equal access for natural persons and legal entities to acquiring ownership of water bodies that, in accordance with this Code, may be owned by natural persons or legal entities;
9) the regulation of water relations within the boundaries of river basin districts (a basin-based approach);
10) the regulation of water relations depending on the characteristics of the regime of water bodies, their physical-geographical, morphometric, and other features;
11) the regulation of water relations based on the interconnection of water bodies and hydraulic structures that form a water management system;
12) the transparency of water use. Decisions on granting water bodies for use and water use agreements must be accessible to any person, with the exception of information classified by the legislation of the Russian Federation as restricted access;
13) the integrated use of water bodies. The use of water bodies may be carried out by one or several water users;
14) the paid use of water bodies. The use of water bodies is carried out for a fee, except in cases established by the legislation of the Russian Federation;
15) economic incentives for the protection of water bodies. When determining the fee for the use of water bodies, the expenses of water users for measures to protect water bodies are taken into account;
16) the use of water bodies in places of traditional residence of the indigenous
