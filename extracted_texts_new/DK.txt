**Chapter 4**
**Water Abstraction and Water Abstraction Plants**

**§ 18.** Groundwater and surface water may not be abstracted without a permit.
*Subsection 2.* Any landowner whose property is located outside a public water supply's natural supply area is, unless it must be assumed that there is an imminent danger that the water will not meet the established requirements for the quality of drinking water or will otherwise be hazardous to health, entitled to abstract groundwater on their own land for household use, cf., however, § 29.
*Subsection 3.* Furthermore, riparian owners may without a permit abstract surface water for watering livestock.

**§ 19.** (Repealed)

**§ 20.** The municipal council shall grant permits for water abstraction, including:
1) Plants with an annual abstraction of groundwater not exceeding 3,000 m³, which are not used for irrigation of agricultural crops.
2) Water supply plants for smaller settlements in the countryside, provided that the plant can supply the entire settlement and the abstraction of groundwater does not exceed 6,000 m³ annually.
*Subsection 2.* A permit for a plant covered by subsection 1, no. 1, which supplies a maximum of four households with water for household use and general agricultural use, can only be refused if it is practically possible to provide the property or properties with another appropriate water supply on reasonably economic terms, or if it must be assumed that there is an imminent danger that the quality of the water in the desired water supply will not meet the established requirements for the quality of drinking water or will otherwise be hazardous to health.

**§ 21.** A water abstraction plant may not be established or substantially repaired or altered before the municipal council has granted a permit for this.
*Subsection 2.* A well or borehole may, however, be established without a permit within a distance of five metres from the previous abstraction point and may be repaired or altered when this is necessary to maintain an existing water supply. Notification of this must be submitted to the municipal council before the work begins.

***

*Subsection 3.* Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 2, the municipal council may decide that the establishment, repair or alteration of a well or borehole may only take place when a permit has been granted for this under subsection 1.

**§ 22.** Permits for water abstraction shall be granted for a specific period, which may not exceed 30 years, cf., however, sentences 2 and 3. Permits for the abstraction of water for irrigation of agricultural crops may, with respect to groundwater, be granted for a period of no more than 15 years and, with respect to surface water, for a period of no more than 10 years. Permits for the abstraction of water for fish farming may be granted for a period of no more than 10 years.
*Subsection 2.* When a water abstraction permit lapses due to a time limitation, a new permit shall be granted to the extent that there is still a need for water abstraction, unless societal considerations, cf. § 1 and § 2, prevent this.
*Subsection 3.* A permit shall specify the quantity and purpose of the abstraction and determine the extent of the investigations and measurements that the plant owner must carry out to provide a basis for assessing any damage to the surroundings as a result of changes in the groundwater level, the flow in watercourses or the water level in lakes, etc.
*Subsection 4.* A permit under § 20 for the abstraction of groundwater shall specify a permissible water table lowering or possibly a permissible water quantity per hour. For the abstraction of surface water, a permissible water quantity per hour shall be set, and the permit may contain information on the minimum flow or minimum water level that the municipal council may require to be maintained. For permits for the abstraction of surface water for fish farming, a flow of at least half of the median minimum flow in the watercourse must always be maintained.
*Subsection 5.* Subsection 4 does not apply to plants covered by § 20(1)(1).
*Subsection 6.* The Minister for Environment and Food may lay down rules on deadlines for submitting an application for renewal of a permit for water abstraction.

**§ 23.** The owner of a water abstraction plant is liable for damage caused to existing conditions by changes in the groundwater level during test drilling and test pumping and during the construction and operation of the plant, cf., however, subsection 3. The compensation may be reduced or lapse insofar as the damage can be attributed to the injured party themselves or is a consequence of special conditions on the injured party's property, for which the injured party is found to bear the risk.
*Subsection 2.* The owner of a water abstraction plant is also liable for damage caused to existing conditions by changes in the flow in watercourses or the water level in lakes, etc., during the construction and operation of the plant, unless otherwise follows from other legal rules, cf., however, subsection 3. The provision in subsection 1, sentence 2, shall apply correspondingly.
*Subsection 3.* Subsections 1 and 2 do not apply to water abstractions covered by § 20(1)(1) or (2).

1) water abstraction plants for which a permit has been granted under § 20 no later than 1 January of the year in question, and the annual permitted abstraction quantity,
2) water abstraction plants covered by § 20, which under § 86 do not require a permit, and the average abstraction quantity for the years 2004-2008,
3) the purpose of the abstraction with the plant (business type),
4) the owner's CVR or CPR number and name and address, and

***

5) other information specified under subsection 3.
*Subsection 2.* The municipal council shall report the information mentioned in subsection 1 no later than 15 January.

**Other Abstraction and Diversion of Water**

**§ 25.** Abstraction of water for drinking water supply through desalination of seawater and delivery of drinking water from abroad may not take place without a permit from the Minister for Environment and Food.
*Subsection 2.* The Minister may lay down rules on the abstraction of seawater for other purposes.
*Subsection 3.* Delivery of groundwater and surface water abroad may not take place without a permit from the Minister.

**§ 26.** In connection with construction and civil engineering works, excavation of clay, gravel, lignite, chalk, etc., the diversion of groundwater or other lowering of the groundwater level may not take place without a permit. The permit is granted by the municipal council, cf., however, § 27.
*Subsection 2.* A permit for diversion is not necessary, however, when the diversion is expected to last for a maximum of two years, when the diversion in each of these years is expected to comprise a maximum of 100,000 m³ of groundwater, and when there are no plants for the abstraction of groundwater within 300 m of the diversion plant which, by their nature, are covered by § 20, except for abstractions covered by § 20(1)(1) and (2). Diversion may also be carried out without a permit when there is a risk of damage to existing road and railway facilities.
*Subsection 3.* A permit may be revoked or amended without compensation if the assumptions on which the decision was based prove to be incorrect or change significantly.
*Subsection 4.* Lowering of the groundwater level, which is carried out for cultivation purposes according to the rules in the Watercourse Act, is not covered by subsections 1-3.
*Subsection 5.* The provisions of subsections 1-3 do not entail any changes to the powers conferred on the building authorities in building legislation.

**§ 27.** Diversion of groundwater or other lowering of the groundwater level, which is carried out in connection with state construction and civil engineering works, may only take place after prior negotiation with the municipal council, cf., however, § 26(2). If disagreement arises between the state construction authority and the municipal council as to which measures are to be taken out of consideration for water supply conditions, the question shall be decided by the Minister for Environment and Food.

**§ 28.** The person for whose account or in whose interest diversion, etc., is carried out is liable for damage caused to existing conditions by changes in the groundwater level, the flow in watercourses or the water level in lakes, etc. The compensation may be reduced or lapse insofar as the damage can be attributed to the injured party themselves or is a consequence of special conditions on the injured party's property, for which the injured party is found to bear the risk.
*Subsection 2.* In the absence of an agreement, the question of compensation shall be decided by the appraisal authorities. The expenses of the appraisal authorities in connection with the handling of the case, apart from remuneration to chairmen and secretaries, shall be paid in advance by the permit authority under §§ 25-27.
*Subsection 3.* For plants covered by § 26(4), the question of compensation shall be decided according to the rules in the Watercourse Act.

***

**Chapter 6**
**Changes to and Lapse of the Right to Water Abstraction**

**§ 29.** For areas where the water supply, based on an overall assessment, is not found to be satisfactory, the municipal council may prepare plans and estimates of the costs of establishing a public water supply and establishing the individual water supply plants.
*Subsection 2.* The Minister for Environment and Food shall then decide whether the public water supply is to be implemented, to what extent existing and future water supply within the area is to take place from the public water supply, on what terms connection to the public water supply is to take place, and whether the public water supply is to be implemented as a municipally owned public water supply or as a cooperative or private company.
*Subsection 3.* The municipal council may decide that one or more properties must be connected to an existing public water supply if the connection is found desirable based on an overall assessment of the conditions in an area or based on the individual property's circumstances. If the tariffs for contributions to the water supply have been set or approved by the municipal council pursuant to § 53(1), payment to the water supply shall be made on the basis of these tariffs, unless the municipal council finds that special circumstances exist which mean that the tariffs cannot reasonably be applied.
*Subsection 4.* The Minister for Environment and Food may, on their own initiative, raise the question of the implementation of a common water supply as mentioned in subsection 2 and may in this connection order the municipal council to prepare plans and estimates.

**§ 30.** Landowners who, after § 29, must cease using their own water supply borehole are entitled to compensation for the expenses of connecting to the public water supply. The compensation may be reduced or lapse taking into account the age of the plant, or if the property's previous water supply and wastewater conditions were not legal or qualitatively satisfactory. The compensation may be reduced by the increase in value that the connection to the public water supply may have added to the property.
*Subsection 2.* In the absence of an agreement, the appraisal authorities shall decide to what extent compensation is to be paid, and to what extent the compensation is to be paid by the municipality and by the interested landowners, respectively. The expenses of the appraisal authorities in connection with the handling of the case, apart from remuneration to chairmen and secretaries, shall be paid in advance by the municipal council.

**§ 31.** If a public water supply as mentioned in § 29 is implemented because it must be expected that the operation of a water abstraction plant or a business will interfere in whole or in part with the groundwater conditions for a settlement, the owner of the water abstraction plant and the business shall pay compensation in the form of a subsidy for the establishment of the public water supply.
*Subsection 2.* In the absence of an agreement, the appraisal authorities shall decide to what extent a subsidy is to be paid. The expenses of the appraisal authorities in connection with the handling of the case, apart from remuneration to chairmen and secretaries, shall be paid in advance by the municipal council.

**§ 32.** The Minister for Environment and Food may, in whole or in part, revoke the abstraction permit for a public water supply's water supply plant when it is necessary for the supply to be taken over in whole or in part by another public water supply in order to ensure a sufficient supply for consumers. The Minister shall make a decision on the future water supply for the consumers concerned, including the terms of the supply. The provision in § 29(3), sentence 2, shall apply correspondingly. The public water supply whose abstraction permit is revoked may demand that it be made a condition for the revocation that the taking-over public water supply also takes over the water supply plant with land and pipeline network under § 37 to the extent that the public water supply that owns this plant cannot in the future utilise the values concerned in an appropriate manner.
*Subsection 2.* The Minister for Environment and Food may, in whole or in part, revoke the abstraction permit for a water supply plant when the revocation is deemed necessary to accommodate a new application for abstraction from a public water supply which is deemed to have significantly greater importance for an appropriate water supply than the plant whose permit is being encroached upon. The revocation may be conditional on the water supply being granted a permit for water abstraction elsewhere, or on a public water supply supplying water. If the new application concerns the abstraction of surface water, the Minister for Environment and Food may in the same way encroach upon other rights to the use of surface water, provided that the rights do not rest on special title.

***

*Subsection 3.* The Minister for Environment and Food may, in whole or in part, revoke abstraction permits when significant societal considerations, cf. § 2, make it necessary that abstraction permits in an area are not utilised or are only utilised to a limited extent.
*Subsection 4.* The question of the extent to which compensation is to be paid in connection with the amendment or revocation shall be decided by the appraisal authorities.

**§ 33.** If there is a significant change in the purpose of a water abstraction, the permit holder must bring the question of continued water abstraction before the municipal council.
*Subsection 2.* A permit for water abstraction may also be utilised by future owners of the property concerned when the purpose of the water abstraction is not significantly changed. The transfer of a water abstraction permit that serves a public water supply requires, however, a new permit, unless the transfer is to another public water supply.

**§ 34.** A permit for water abstraction may be amended or revoked without compensation if the permit has been granted on the basis of incorrect information of significant importance, or if the conditions for the permit are disregarded.

**§ 35.** A permit for water abstraction may be revoked without compensation when abstraction has not taken place within a continuous period of five years.

**§ 36.** If the lapse of a permit for abstraction means that a water supply well or borehole becomes redundant, or if the property at the same time has another water supply which can essentially replace the supply from the well or borehole, the municipal council may order that the well be filled in or the borehole be sealed. The Minister for Environment and Food may issue rules on the procedure for filling in and sealing.

**Chapter 7**
**Expropriation and Agreements on Real Property**

**§ 37.** For the benefit of a public water supply, when the public good so requires and when a permit for the plant has been granted, the following may be acquired by expropriation:
1) ownership of areas, buildings and installations that are permanently attached to areas or buildings, as well as accessories thereto,
2) permanent or temporary imposition of restrictions on the owners' right of disposal or acquisition of the right to exercise a special right of disposal over real property, including to carry out test drilling and test pumping,
3) permanent or temporary acquisition or termination of or imposition of limitations on rights of use, easements and other rights over real property, and or
4) permanent or temporary imposition of restrictions on or termination of rights to the use of surface water, when the use rests on special title.
*Subsection 2.* In the case of expropriation under subsection 1, no. 1, all rights over the expropriated property shall lapse, unless otherwise determined in the individual case. In the case of expropriation under subsection 1, no. 2, rights over real property that are established by the expropriation shall be respected by the holder of all rights over the property, unless otherwise determined in the individual case.

**§ 38.** For the benefit of a non-public water supply, when the public good so requires and when a permit for the plant has been granted, restrictions on the right of disposal may be imposed on real property by expropriation for the purpose of laying pipelines. The provision in § 37(2), sentence 2, shall apply correspondingly.

***

**§ 39.** The state and the municipalities may, on private land, have all surveys, levelling, soundings and other technical preparatory work and investigations carried out which are necessary for the preparation of plans for water supply plants or for the protection of water against pollution. However, the provision does not cover drilling for water.
*Subsection 2.* The same right is granted to public water supplies after necessary security has been provided and after authorisation from the municipal council.
*Subsection 3.* At least two weeks' notice must be given in writing to the owners and users of the property concerned or, if this is not possible, be published in one or more of the local newspapers.
*Subsection 4.* The damage and inconvenience caused by the measures shall be compensated, possibly in connection with a subsequent expropriation. In the absence of an agreement, the compensation shall be determined by the appraisal authorities.

**§ 40.** The decision on expropriation is made by the municipal council.
*Subsection 2.* The Minister for Environment and Food may decide that the decision on expropriation shall be made by the Minister for Environment and Food after negotiation with the affected municipal councils.
*Subsection 3.* §§ 100-102 of the Public Roads Act shall apply correspondingly.

**§ 41.** If expropriation is to take place for the benefit of the same water supply in several municipalities at the same time, the Minister for Environment and Food may decide that the expropriation shall take place according to the rules in the Act on the Procedure for Expropriation of Real Property.
