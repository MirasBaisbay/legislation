It shall execute this budget from a specific account opened with a bank.
All revenues collected for the public drinking water service must be fully allocated to the sector.

**Article 53:** The tariff policy and the recovery of costs in the sector must, in particular, respect the following principles:
*   Access to the public water service, whether at public standpipes or individual connections, must always be paid for.
*   For each water system, the applicable tariffs must, in the long term, allow for cost recovery:
    *   In urban centers, full recovery, if possible, of investment, renewal, and operating costs.
    *   In rural and semi-urban centers, full recovery of operating and renewal costs and partial recovery, if possible, of investment costs.
*   Each system must be managed autonomously from a financial point of view, and any direct or indirect subsidies received must be strictly accounted for.
*   Tariffs must be revised periodically to take into account the evolution of investment and operating conditions, based on criteria defined by the sector's Regulatory Commission.
*   When public drinking water services obtain their water resources from multi-purpose works, the price paid by these services for access to the resources may not be higher than the average price paid by other users.

**Article 54:** Unless an express exemption is granted by the Regulatory Commission, supplies to consumers must be metered.
The elements of the tariff structure must obligatorily include the following fees, which constitute the remuneration for the services rendered:
*   A contribution to initial establishment costs, in particular connection fees.
*   A fixed fee per billing period.
*   Fees based on the volumes consumed.
The tariffs for volumes of water consumed by domestic consumers must obligatorily include a social tariff block at a preferential rate, the volume of which in m3 may not exceed a threshold set by a directive from the Regulatory Commission.
Consumption beyond this social block may be billed according to progressive block tariffs, compatible with the users' ability to pay, the consumption structure, and the financial viability of the operation.
Supplies to the managers of public standpipes are bulk supplies, and their tariff must be that applicable to the social block of domestic consumption.
The total of taxes and surcharges levied by decentralized local authorities on the invoices of the public water service may not exceed a percentage of the pre-tax amount of these invoices, to be set by a decree issued by the Council of Ministers.
Supplies to public standpipes and to the first domestic social block are exempt from all local taxes and surcharges.
Delegated managers, whether natural or legal persons under public or private law, are subject to the common law tax regime without discrimination resulting from their different legal nature.

**Section 4: The Public Water Service Development Fund**

**Article 55:** A special treasury allocation account called the Water Development Fund is hereby created.
The Fund is essentially constituted by allocations from the State, subsidies from donors, donations, legacies, and loans, and secondarily from the proceeds of fines collected from polluters and abstractors, as well as all or part of the proceeds of royalties on water resources and from delegated managers.
The Fund is managed by a Management Committee comprising representatives of the Ministries in charge of water, finance, and the supervision of local authorities.
