TITLE II
AUTHORIZATION REGIME

Article 10: No work may be carried out in the bed of or above a watercourse or adjoining it, whether or not it modifies its regime, and no diversion or abstraction of water from the public domain with a flow rate exceeding 10 m³/h, particularly for groundwater, in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever, by removing it momentarily or permanently from its course or its deposit or location, may be done without authorization granted by a decision of the Commissioner of the Republic, issued after an inquiry and after the opinion of the technical services, following an application.

Article 11: The application for authorization, drawn up on stamped paper, shall be addressed to the Commissioner of the Republic of the district in which the planned work is to be located.
It must specify precisely:

The name and capacity of the petitioner;

The nature and purpose of the work;

The location where the drilling is carried out and the work is established;

The name and the point of the watercourse where this work is established;

The works established downstream and upstream, the drillings established nearby, or the confirmation that none exist;

The duration for which the authorization is requested. The application must be accompanied by a comprehensive project plan, drawn up in three copies, of the work and its annexes.

A draft maximum tariff for the sale of electrical energy, if the authorization request concerns a geothermal plant whose main or accessory purpose is this sale.

Article 12: The application, as soon as it is in proper form, shall be published in the Official Journal of the Republic of Djibouti and posted at the administrative center(s) of the district(s) of the territorial authority on whose territory the work is to be established.
It shall be filed at the commissariat of the Republic and kept for six weeks at the disposal of the public, who may formulate, in writing, any observations regarding it.
The six-week period shall be counted from the date of posting at the administrative center of the interested territorial authority. This posting must be done without delay, immediately upon receipt of the Official Journal, and the date shall be recorded in an official report.

Article 13: The application file is then transmitted to the head of the district service in charge of hydraulics. Upon the latter's proposal, the Commissioner of the Republic shall designate the agent who will be responsible for the technical review of the application.
The agent in charge of the review, after giving notice at least five days in advance to the head of the territorial authority, the petitioner, and the claimants or their representatives, shall proceed with a site visit in their presence, or they having been duly summoned. They shall verify the accuracy of the documents produced, collect all technical or administrative information they deem necessary, hear and record the claims of the interested parties, as well as the responses that may be made to these claims, and seek solutions that can safeguard the public interest while satisfying private interests. They shall draw up a report on these operations in which they shall record, along with the statement of the case, the state of the premises and the adopted benchmarks, the statements of the parties, the observations and all information, the details on the level of the water tables and the watercourse, the utility or opportunity of annexed works, and which they shall conclude with reasoned findings.

Article 14: The documents provided for in the preceding article shall be submitted to the head of the district service in charge of hydraulics, who shall attach them to the application file and forward the entire set, with their proposals, to the Commissioner of the Republic. The latter either grants the requested authorization by decision or pronounces the refusal by a decision made in the same forms.
The Commissioner of the Republic is required to rule within a period of one year from the date of the publication of the application in the Official Journal of the Republic of Djibouti.
In the case where the authorization application relates to a geothermal plant, the authorization only becomes final after approval by the Minister in charge of energy.

Article 15: The authorization decision includes water regulations and lists the fundamental characteristics of the authorization granted: beneficiary, nature, location and duration, reservation of third-party rights, and conditions to which it is subject.
The decision specifies all the particular obligations to which the beneficiary is subject from a technical point of view, such as, for a water intake: maximum flow of water to be diverted, or to be abstracted in the case of groundwater, height of the dam, level of the reservoir, form and dimensions of the regulatory works (spillways, discharge gates, etc.), points of intake and restitution of water, and in general, all safety and hygiene measures intended to ensure the conservation and wholesomeness of the water, to prevent floods, to safeguard the interests of agriculture and industry, the rate of the annual fee due to the State, the deadline for completion of the works, and cases for withdrawal of the authorization. When the authorization relates to the production of energy sold to the public, the decree may contain provisions relating to this sale and must, in particular, set the maximum tariffs to be revised periodically. The annual fee, mentioned above, provided for does not exempt from the payment of fees that may be required for the temporary occupation of the public water domain necessitated by the installations.

Article 16: The authorization is granted for a determined duration that may not exceed seventy-five years. The authorization may, always in the same forms, be renewed for a new period of time. The refusal by the administration to grant the renewal does not give rise to any right to compensation. If the permit holder has not been given formal notice, at least two years before the expiration of the authorization, to remove or modify the works they have established, this authorization is automatically extended for a duration equal to half of its original duration. However, this provision is not applicable to authorizations whose original duration did not exceed two years.

Article 17: The granted authorization is personal and may not be transferred to third parties other than heirs except by virtue of an authorization given in the original form. However, the authorization to use water granted specifically and explicitly for an agricultural operation or an industrial establishment remains attached to that operation or establishment regardless of the hands it passes into, provided that the authority that granted the authorization has been notified of the change of beneficiary within two months following the transfer.

Article 18: When several applications for water intake authorization are in competition and if the Commissioner of the Republic deems that there is no reason to grant preference to the first in date, he shall rule by decision, after the parties have been heard or duly summoned.

Article 19: The authorization is always granted subject to the rights of third parties. It is precarious and revocable at any time by decision of the Commissioner of the Republic, on the proposal of the head of the district service in charge of hydraulics:

If a reason of public interest requires its withdrawal;

For non-performance, except in cases of force majeure, of one of the conditions stipulated in the authorization decision, the execution of which is specified as entailing the withdrawal of the authorization.
In the first case, the eviction gives the permit holder the right, as compensation for the damage caused, to an indemnity which is fixed either amicably or by the competent courts.

Article 20: At the end of the works and, at the latest, at the expiration of the deadline set for their completion, a contradictory verification of the executed works is carried out by the delegate of the head of the district service in charge of hydraulics. A report of this verification is drawn up, which indicates whether the works conform to the conditions of the authorization and points out, if applicable, the points on which they deviate.

Article 21: The on-site investigation costs for authorization applications, whether the authorization is granted or refused, are borne by the applicant. The same applies to the costs of the final inspection of the works. These costs are recovered in the same manner as direct revenues.

TITLE III
CONCESSION REGIME

Article 22: The waters of the public water domain may be the subject of concessions for a duration not exceeding seventy-five years. The provisions for installations and works placed under the authorization regime, in Articles 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, and 21, are applicable to installations and works placed under the concession regime. However, in addition to the documents listed in Article 11, the application file must include a descriptive memorandum indicating the summary evaluation of the establishment costs as well as the operating expenses and revenues. The act of concession, to which a set of specifications is annexed, is passed in the name of the State by the Commissioner of the Republic.
However, if the act of concession relates to the production of energy by a geothermal plant, it only becomes final after approval by the minister in charge of energy.
The specifications detail all the obligations of the concessionaire, as stated in Article 15, and determine in particular the provisions relating to the sale of energy to the public, the immovable property dependencies of the concession, the conditions of their takeover, the conditions and forms in which forfeiture may be pronounced for non-observance of the obligations imposed on the concessionaire, the conditions in which, in case of buyout or forfeiture, the State will be substituted for all the rights and obligations of the concessionaire, the security deposit and guarantees that may be required, the bases for calculating the fees due to the State, etc. The granted concession is personal; any partial or total transfer of the concession, any change of concessionaire can only take place, under penalty of forfeiture, by virtue of an authorization resulting from a decision of the Commissioner of the Republic.

Article 23: The concession invests the holder, for the execution of works defined in the specifications, with all the rights that the laws and regulations confer on the administration in matters of public works. The concessionaire remains at the same time subject to all the obligations that derive for the administration from these laws and regulations. The installations, lands, buildings, and engines of all kinds, determined in the specifications as constituting the immovable property dependencies of the concession, are part of the public water domain. The conditions under which the administration will take possession of them at the expiration of the concession are determined by the specifications.

Article 24: When an application seeking to obtain the extension of a concession is submitted at most ten years and at least five years before its expiration, the administration is required to rule, after inquiry and following the prescribed procedure, within two years following the filing of the application. Failing to have ruled within this period, a formal notice may be addressed to it and, in the absence of a decision within the year following the formal notice, the concession is extended by right for an additional period of twenty-five years, under the clauses of the previous specifications.

TITLE IV
GENERAL PROVISIONS

Article 25: The owners of works and establishments of all kinds, subject to authorization by virtue of this decree and existing on the day of its publication, are required to act with due diligence within a period of two years from this date to obtain the authorization required by said decree.
However, if it concerns establishments or operations previously authorized by the administration, the period only runs from the formal notice addressed to each owner and its duration is only one year.
In the event that the administration refuses all or part of the required authorization and, as a result, the owners find themselves under the obligation to totally or partially destroy the works or establishments tolerated until then, they shall receive a just and prior indemnity. In case of dispute and in the absence of an amicable agreement, the matter shall be decided by the competent court.

Article 26: The deprivation of the rights of use exercised over the waters of the public water domain by any others gives rise to an indemnity settled, in case of litigation, by the court.

Article 27: In regions where the application of the provisions of Articles 10 to 26 above would raise difficulties due to customary rules of water use and sharing, or as a result of exceptional local circumstances, the minister in charge of hydraulics may, after a decree from the President of the Republic, suspend for a determined period the implementation of these provisions, and prescribe such other measures as he deems appropriate to reconcile the interests of agriculture and industry with respect for previously established rights and uses. This decree may be renewed in the same form.

Article 28: Any authorization or concession is precarious, modifiable, and revocable at any time, by right and without indemnity, by the Commissioner of the Republic in the following cases:

For a reason of general interest, and notably if public utility necessitates the modification or suppression of the installations or works;

In the interest of public health and notably when this modification or suppression is necessary for the supply of drinking water to inhabited areas;

To prevent or stop damage caused by water, and notably floods;

For non-observance, after formal notice, except in case of force majeure, of one of the conditions prescribed by the authorization decision containing water regulations, or by the decision containing the specifications.

Article 29: Any modification or revocation of an authorization or concession pronounced in hypotheses other than those referred to in Article 28 above shall be the subject of an indemnity paid by the State, as compensation for the damage suffered, to the holder of the authorization or concession, and fixed either amicably or by the competent courts.

Article 30: The act of authorization or concession also carries, where applicable, authorization for the occupation of the public water domain.

Article 31: The investigation costs of applications for authorization or concession, whether the authorization or concession is granted or refused, are borne by the applicant. The same applies to the costs of the final inspection of the works. These costs are recovered in the same manner as direct revenues.

Article 32: The information collected during surveys, excavations, and drillings shall be transmitted to the minister in charge of hydraulics.

Article 33: The use of pumping equipment with a capacity exceeding a flow rate that risks jeopardizing the sustainability of the water points of the solicited aquifer may be prohibited. The limit flow rates will be set by circulars.

Article 34: Non-compliance with the prohibitions provided for in Article 33 above is punishable by a fine. The amount of the fine is set by decree.

Article 35: Disputes or contests arising in connection with an authorization or a concession fall under the competence of the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and the Sea.
