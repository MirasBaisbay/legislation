THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA

DECREES:

Article 1.- The following is promulgated:

WATER LAW

CHAPTER ONE

SECTION I
On Waters of the Public and Private Domain

Article 1.- The following are waters of the public domain:

I.- The waters of the territorial seas to the extent and in the terms established by international law;

II.- The waters of the lagoons and estuaries of the beaches that are connected permanently or intermittently with the sea;

III.- The waters of naturally formed inland lakes that are directly linked to constant currents;

IV.- The waters of rivers and their direct or indirect tributaries, streams, or springs from the point where the first permanent waters emerge to their mouth in the sea or in lakes, lagoons, or estuaries;

V.- The waters of constant or intermittent currents whose channel, in its entirety or in part, serves as a boundary of the national territory, with the dominion over such currents being subject to what has been established in international treaties celebrated with neighboring countries and, in the absence thereof, or regarding matters not provided for, to the provisions of this law;

VI.- The waters of any current that directly or indirectly flows into those enumerated in section V;

VII.- The waters extracted from mines, with the limitation indicated in Article 10;

VIII.- The waters of springs that emerge on beaches, maritime zones, channels, basins, or banks of national property and, in general, all waters originating on lands of the public domain;

IX.- Underground waters whose extraction is not carried out by means of wells; and

X.- Rainwater that flows through ravines or dry riverbeds whose channels are of the public domain.

Article 2.- The waters enumerated in the preceding article are of national property, and the dominion over them is not lost nor has it been lost when, by the execution of artificial works or prior use, their natural characteristics are altered or have been altered.

Waters that are used by virtue of contracts granted by the State are excepted, which shall be subject to the conditions authorized in the respective concession.

Article 3.- The following are also of national property:

I.- Beaches and maritime zones;

II.- The basins of lakes, lagoons, and estuaries of national property;

III.- The channels of public domain currents;

IV.- Lands reclaimed from the sea by natural causes or by artificial works;

V.- Lands gained from currents, lakes, lagoons, or estuaries, by works executed with the authorization of the State; and

VI.- Islands that form in the territorial seas, in the basins of lakes, lagoons, or estuaries, or in the channels of currents of national property, provided that they do not originate from a bifurcation of the river on lands of private property.

Article 4.- The following are waters of the private domain and belong to the owner of the land:

I.- Rainwater that falls on their property while it flows through it. Consequently, the owner may build, within their property, ponds, marshes, cisterns, or reservoirs to conserve it for that purpose, or use any other suitable means, provided that it does not cause harm to the public or to a third party;

II.- Lagoons or ponds formed on lands of their respective domain, provided that the case foreseen in Section II of Article 1 is not present. Those located on lands of communal use belong to the respective towns;

III.- Underground waters that the owner obtains from their own land by means of wells; and

IV.- Thermal, mineral, and mineral-medicinal waters, regardless of where they emerge. Said waters shall be under the control of the Secretariat of Health when they are declared of public utility.

Article 5.- The owner of a piece of land where a spring of water emerges, which has been used by them before the promulgation of this law, may continue to use it freely in the volumes and manner in which they have done so prior to the indicated date. If they have entered into agreements prior to the same date with those who make use of it, said agreements must be respected. However, if that water or part of it should be needed for the purposes determined by Law No. 16 of October 20, that use may be limited to the quantity necessary to fulfill said purposes, without prejudice to the compensation to which the owner may be entitled if the limitation imposed causes them harm. In the same manner, these uses shall be limited in the cases determined by Chapter VII of this law.

Article 6.- Every owner may freely, without need of a concession, dig wells to draw water within their properties for domestic use and the ordinary necessities of life, even if this results in the diminishment of the waters of their neighbors; however, they must maintain a distance of two meters between wells within towns, and fifteen meters in the countryside between the new excavation and the permanent wells, ponds, fountains, and watercourses of the neighbors.

Article 7.- The extraction of underground waters obtained for purposes other than those indicated in the preceding article, or by means of artesian wells, tunnels, or galleries, may be obtained through a concession; and whoever obtains it shall enjoy the water while it flows through their land, but as soon as the surplus leaves it, it shall become waters of the public domain.

When there is a danger that, as a consequence of the work on the artesian well, tunnel, or gallery, public waters destined for a public service or a pre-existing private use with legitimately acquired rights are diverted or diminished, the police authority, at the request of the interested parties, may order the suspension of the work, even if the new concession has already been granted, while the definitive pronouncement of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, or of the common courts in its case, is obtained.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 8.- The works referred to in the preceding article for water extraction may not be executed at a distance of less than forty meters from others' buildings, a railroad, or a highway, nor less than one hundred meters from another extraction point, spring, river, canal, watercourse, or public watering place, without the corresponding license from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.

Nor may these works be executed within a mining claim without prior stipulation for the compensation of damages.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 9.- The concessionaires of mining claims, tunnels, and general mine drainage galleries have ownership of the waters found in their works as long as they retain ownership of their respective mines.

The water, once it leaves the mining claim, shall become public.

SECTION II
On the Common Uses of Public Waters

Article 10.- The free use of the littoral sea, navigable rivers, inlets, roadsteads, bays, and sounds is understood to be for navigating, fishing, embarking, disembarking, anchoring, and other similar acts, in accordance with the legal or regulatory prescriptions that govern it and provided that such use has not been the subject of a particular concession or a reservation by the State. In the same situation is the use of beaches, which authorizes everyone, with equal restrictions, to travel over them, bathe, lay out and dry clothes and nets, beach, careen, and build boats, water livestock, and collect shells, plants, and seafood.

Article 11.- As long as the waters flow through their natural and public channels and a particular concession does not prevent it, everyone may use them to drink, wash clothes, vessels, and any other objects, bathe, and water or bathe horses and livestock, subject to police regulations.

Article 12.- From waters that, having been artificially diverted from their natural and public channels, flow through open canals, watercourses, or aqueducts, even if they belong to particular concessionaires, everyone may extract and carry in vessels the amount they need for domestic and industrial uses and for watering isolated plants; but the extraction must be done precisely by hand, without any kind of machine or apparatus, and without stopping the course of the water or damaging the banks of the canal or watercourse. The authority must limit or prohibit the use of this right when it causes harm to the concessionaire of the waters. It is understood that no one may enter private property to seek or use water without the owner's permission.

Article 13.- In open canals, watercourses, or aqueducts of public waters, even if they are the temporary property of the concessionaires, everyone may wash clothes, vessels, or other objects, provided that the banks are not damaged thereby, and that it does not involve waters that, due to the use for which they are intended, must be kept in a state of purity; but one may not bathe, nor water livestock or horses, except precisely in the places designated for this purpose.

Article 14.- Everyone may fish in public channels, subject to the police laws and regulations that specifically exist or may be issued regarding fishing, provided that navigation and flotation are not hindered. Fishing using explosives or poisoning of the waters is absolutely prohibited.

Article 15.- In the canals, watercourses, or aqueducts for the conveyance of public waters, even if constructed by the concessionaires thereof, and unless the use of fishing has been reserved to them by the conditions of the concession, everyone may fish with hooks, nets, or fish traps, subject to the special laws and regulations on fishing, provided that the course of the water is not obstructed nor the canal or its banks damaged.

Article 16.- In waters of the private domain and in those granted for the establishment of fish ponds or hatcheries, only the owners or concessionaires, or those who have obtained their permission, may fish, with no more restrictions than those related to public health.

CHAPTER TWO

SECTION I
On Special Uses of Public Waters

Article 17.- Authorization is necessary for the use of public waters, especially those dedicated to enterprises of public or private interest. This authorization shall be granted by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy in the manner prescribed in this law, an institution to which it corresponds to dispose and resolve on the dominion, use, utilization, governance, or surveillance over public domain waters, in accordance with Law No. 258 of August 18, 1941. Excepted are potable waters destined for the construction of water mains for populations subject to the control of the Secretariat of Public Health, according to Law No. 16 of October 30, 1941.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 18.- Any person enjoying a water right must exhibit the concession they hold to exercise that right. However, anyone who, on the date of the promulgation of this law, has enjoyed the use of public waters for twenty years, without opposition from the authority or a third party, shall have the right to continue enjoying it, even if they cannot prove how they obtained the corresponding authorization, provided they are subject to the restrictions determined by Article 21, when the flow is not sufficient to supply the needs of the lower properties.

Existing uses, protected by titles, concessions, or confirmations issued prior to the date of this law, are fully confirmed by law, provided that the concessionaires have complied with the obligations imposed in the respective titles.

The rights for the use of waters established by special laws shall have the character of concessions, but they must be registered in the respective Registry of Concessions.

Users who hold titles different from those indicated in the preceding cases are obliged to request confirmation of their rights from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy. The application must be submitted within a period of one year from the effective date of this law, when it concerns uses that exist in public water currents.

After these periods have elapsed, the legalization of the uses can only be done by means of a new concession.

De facto uses shall be legalized at the request of the interested parties and through inspection, provided that the application is submitted within one year from the promulgation of this law. If not done within that period, the interested party must request their concession in accordance with the procedures established in this law.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 19.- Every concession for the use of public water shall be understood to be made, even if not expressly stated, without prejudice to a third party with a better right and reserving the rights of private parties in the order determined by Article 27. The duration of the concessions shall be determined, in each case, according to the circumstances and is fixed at a maximum term of thirty years.

Article 20.- In concessions for the use of public waters, the concession of the public domain lands necessary for the dam works and for the canals and watercourses shall be understood to be included.

With respect to lands owned by the State, the Municipalities, towns, and private parties, proceedings shall be taken, as the case may be, to impose a compulsory easement, with the formalities of the law.

The expropriation shall be carried out by the Secretariat of State in the Office of Government and Police with the procedures indicated in Law No. 36 of June 26, 1896, supplemented by No. 78 of June 24, 1938, or that which at the time governs the matter.

Article 21.- In every concession for the use of public waters, its nature, the quantity in liters per second of the water granted shall be fixed; and if it is for irrigation, the extent of the land to be irrigated, as well as the type of crops to be served, taking into consideration the needs of the lower properties that also require it. If the water is not sufficient to meet all demands, each concessionaire shall be assigned the number of hours per day, per week, or per month in which they can make their use, and these hours shall be calculated according to the number of owners served by the same flow, taking into account the extent of their crops. The concessionaire who does not adhere to the hours granted shall lose the right to use the water, in addition to the other punitive sanctions determined in subsection 2 of Article 166.

In uses prior to this law, only the amount of water necessary for their purpose shall be understood to be granted.

Article 22.- Waters granted for one use may not be applied to another diverse use without the corresponding authorization, which shall be granted as if it were a new concession.

Article 23.- The Ministry of the Environment and Energy assumes no responsibility for the lack or decrease of water that may result in the flow expressed in the concession, whether it proceeds from error or any other cause. It shall be understood that every concession is extended with this release of responsibility, even if not expressly stated.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 24.- Whenever in the concessions and in the enjoyments of determined quantities of water, for a fixed period of time, nothing else is expressed, continuous use is understood to be for all moments; if it is by days, the natural day shall be understood as 24 hours, from midnight; if it is during the day or during the night, it shall extend between six o'clock and eighteen o'clock, or between eighteen o'clock and six o'clock the following day, respectively; and if it is by weeks, they shall be counted from twenty-four o'clock on Sunday; if it is for festive days or with their exclusion, those that were such at the time of the concession or contract shall be understood. If the concession is to be made by hours, the Water Inspector shall fix these in the cases determined by the second part of Article 21, taking into account the circumstances set forth in the first part of this provision.

Article 25.- Concessions shall be extinguished:

I.- By expiration of the period for which they were granted;

II.- By cessation of the object for which the use was intended; and

III.- By forfeiture, which shall be declared administratively by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, after hearing the interested parties.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 26.- The following are causes for forfeiture of concessions:

I.- The lack of use and utilization of the waters for a period of three consecutive years or three years within five;

II.- The application of the waters to uses other than those indicated in the concession. If it concerns irrigation, by applying the water to other properties different from those for which it was granted, without permission from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.

III.- That the concessionaire has been condemned twice for taking, to the detriment of a third party, a greater volume of water than that to which he is authorized by the title;

IV.- The total or partial transfer, administration, or encumbrance of the concession, directly or indirectly, in favor of foreign Governments or States, or the admission of these with any kind of participation in the concession or in the company that exploits it. In the assessment of this cause, the Ministry of the Environment and Energy shall not be obliged to adhere to the common rules of evidence and it will suffice that it has the moral conviction of its existence to decree the forfeiture, without any claim from the interested parties;

V.- The transfer or encumbrance of the concession, in whole or in part, or of the works to which it refers, without prior authorization from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy. If the concession had been granted for the irrigation of the concessionaire's own lands and were alienated together with them, there shall be no cause for forfeiture of the concession, even if the requirement of prior authorization from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy had been omitted, provided that the acquirer had the capacity, according to this law, to be a concessionaire of waters. In any case, the acquirer must report the transfer to the Ministry of the Environment and Energy within six months of the date on which it was completed. If after this period has elapsed the acquirer does not give the respective notice, the penalty indicated in Article 166 of this law shall be imposed; and

VI.- Those indicated in Articles 22 and 57.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 27.- In the concession of special uses of public waters, the following order of preference shall be observed:

I.- Water mains for populations whose control is under the Secretariat of Public Health;

II.- Supply for populations, domestic services, watering places, dairies, and baths;

III.- Supply for railways and means of transport;

IV.- Development of hydraulic or hydroelectric forces for public services;

V.- Coffee processing plants, sugar mills, mills, and other factories;

VI.- Irrigation;

VII.- Development of hydraulic or hydroelectric forces for private services;

VIII.- Navigation canals; and

IX.- Ponds for fish farms.

Within each class, enterprises of greater importance and utility shall be preferred; and in equality of circumstances, those that had previously requested the use, without responsibility of any kind on the part of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 28.- Every special use of public waters is subject to compulsory expropriation for reasons of public utility—subject to the corresponding compensation—in favor of another use that precedes it, according to the order established in the preceding article; but not in favor of those that follow it unless by virtue of a special law.

The expropriation shall be carried out through the ordinary procedures, and shall be decreed by the Secretariat of Government by virtue of the request received on the matter from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, which shall not request it unless it considers the application just and legal.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 29.- In urgent cases of fire, flood, or other public calamity, the authority may dispose instantly and without prior procedure or compensation, but subject to ordinances and regulations, if any, of the necessary waters to contain or prevent the damage. If the waters are public, there shall be no grounds for compensation; but if they have an industrial or agricultural application, or are of private domain, and their diversion has caused appreciable damage, this shall be compensated. The claim for damages and losses must be filed within fifteen days following the date on which they occurred and shall be resolved, through the procedures for incidental matters, by the Civil Treasury Judge. The decision on the matter issued by the Civil Chamber, hearing the case on appeal, shall have the character of res judicata.

SECTION II
Water Mains for Populations

Article 30.- The potable waters of rivers and springs, in any part of the national territory where they are found, shall be subject to the water main service in the populations, as determined by the Executive Branch.

Article 31.- The following are declared as a domain reserve in favor of the Nation:

a) The lands that surround the sites of capture or supply intakes of potable water, in a perimeter of no less than two hundred meters in radius;

b) The forest zone that protects or should protect the set of lands where the infiltration of potable waters occurs, as well as that which provides a base for hydrographic basins and deposit margins, supply springs, or the permanent course of the same waters.

Article 32.- When in an area larger than that previously indicated there is a danger of contamination either in surface or underground waters, the Executive Branch, through the Potable Water Section referred to in the following article, shall arrange in said area the measures it deems appropriate to prevent the danger of contamination.

Article 33.- A Potable Water Section is established as a dependency of the Secretariat of Public Health and Social Protection, which shall have exclusive charge of everything related to the use and administration of the waters of the water mains and sanitary services: their technical treatment to make them potable; their provision to the various populations as may be determined; the surveillance of the respective services and the preparation of plans, designs, organization, technique, and management of the water main services or water distribution systems for sanitary services. Matters relating to the execution, construction, and repair of the works necessary for such purposes shall correspond to the Water Mains Section or Department of the Secretariat of Development.

SECTION III
Supply of Populations, Domestic Services, Watering Places, Dairies, and Baths

Article 34.- When the normal flow of water that a population enjoys does not reach fifty liters per day per inhabitant, of which twenty are potable, it may be granted from that destined for other uses, and with prior corresponding compensation, the amount needed to complete such provision.

Article 35.- If the population in need of potable water already enjoys a flow of non-potable waters, but applicable to other public and domestic uses, it may be supplemented, with prior corresponding compensation, when appropriate, with twenty daily liters of the former per inhabitant, even if this quantity, added to the non-potable, exceeds the fifty liters fixed in the preceding article.

Article 36.- The compulsory alienation of privately owned waters for the supply of a population shall not be decreed until it has been legally declared, in view of the studies carried out for that purpose, that there are no public waters that can be rationally applied to the same object, in the judgment of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 37.- Domestic services include the supply of water to satisfy the needs of the inhabitants, the irrigation of crops on lands not exceeding half a hectare, the washing of drains, and the supply of water for fire hydrants.

Article 38.- The uses for watering places, dairies, and baths shall be regulated according to the needs, but whoever wishes to avail themselves of them must obtain the corresponding concession, through the procedures determined in this law.

Article 39.- The current uses determined by the preceding articles of this Section shall continue to benefit the current users, but they are subject to the obligations determined in Article 18 of this law.

Article 40.- The increases in the flow of water for the supply of populations and other uses referred to in this Section shall be made following the procedures determined in the seventh chapter of this law.

Article 41.- The waters of the current water mains for the supply of populations shall continue to be administered by the respective Municipalities or appointed Boards as they are at present, until the Executive Branch decrees the nationalization of the service, as prescribed in the preceding Section; and those that are constructed in the future shall be under the control of the Secretariat of Public Health or the Municipalities, as the case may be.

Article 44.- When railways cross irrigated lands, the companies shall have the right to take, at the most convenient points for the railway service, the amount of water corresponding to the land they have occupied and paid for, being obliged to satisfy in the same proportion the irrigation fee, or to defray the ordinary and extraordinary expenses of the watercourse, as the case may be, all according to a resolution to be issued in this regard by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 45.- In the absence or insufficiency of the means authorized in the preceding articles, railway companies shall have rights, for their exclusive service, to the necessary water that, being of private domain, is not destined for domestic uses, and in such cases, the law of compulsory expropriation shall apply.

SECTION V
Supply for the Development of Hydraulic and Hydroelectric Forces for Public and Private Services

Article 46.- The concessions for the use of public waters for the development of hydraulic and hydroelectric forces for public and private services shall be governed by the provisions contained in Law No. 258 of August 18, 1941, and in the Regulations that the Executive Branch shall issue on the matter. However, the provisions of this law shall also be applicable to them, as long as they do not contradict the precepts of the aforementioned Law No. 258.

SECTION VI
Use of Public Waters for Irrigation

Article 47.- The owners of properties contiguous to public roads may collect the rainwater that flows through them, and use it for the irrigation of their properties, subject to the provisions of the ordinances for the conservation and policing of said roads.

Article 48.- The owners of properties bordering public watercourses of non-continuous flow such as dry riverbeds, ravines, and other similar public domain areas, may use the rainwater that flows through them for their irrigation and construct for this purpose, without the need for authorization, earth and loose stone embankments or dams.

Article 49.- When these embankments or dams may cause floods or any other harm to the public, the authority, ex officio or at the request of a party, upon verifying the danger, shall order the one who built them to modify them as necessary to dispel all fear or, if necessary, to destroy them. If they threaten to cause harm to private parties, the latter may file a claim before the local police authority; and if the harm occurs, they shall have their right expedited before the Courts of Justice, with the application of the rules of Article 29.

Article 50.- Those who hold a concession or who for twenty years have used for the irrigation of their lands the rainwater that descends through a dry riverbed or ravine, or other similar public domain channel, may oppose the owners of higher properties depriving them of this use. But if they have only used part of the water, they cannot prevent others from using the remainder, provided that the course of the quantity they have long used remains unimpeded.

Article 51.- The provisions of the preceding articles regarding rainwater are applicable to that of discontinuous springs that only flow in times of abundant rainfall.

Article 52.- When it is intended to build permanent dams in order to use for irrigation the rainwater or discontinuous springs that run through public channels, permission from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy will be necessary.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 53.- In navigable rivers, the riverside owners may freely establish on their respective banks pumps or any other apparatus intended to extract the necessary water for the irrigation of their bordering properties, provided they do not cause harm to navigation or to third parties. Navigable rivers are considered to be those indicated in Article 16 of Decree No. 6 of April 2, 1940, up to where the tides are markedly perceptible.

Article 54.- When there are uses based on a recognized and valid right, a new concession shall only be possible if the gauging of the waters in ordinary years shows a surplus of the requested flow, after the existing uses have been completely covered.

When for any reason the water becomes scarce, the new concessionaires may not take it until all the needs of the old users are satisfied, among whom the same order shall be maintained; so that no person may take the water until all the needs of the one with an older title or right to use it are covered.

Article 55.- When public waters of a river, running entirely or partially below the surface of the ground, imperceptible to the sight, are brought to a higher level by the construction of embankments or the use of other means, making them applicable for irrigation or other uses, this result shall be considered, for the effects of this law, as an extraction of water made usable.

The irrigators or industrialists situated downstream, who by prescription or concession have acquired a legitimate title to the use and utilization of those waters that are intended to be artificially brought to the surface, shall have the right to claim and to oppose the new superior extraction, insofar as it may cause them harm. If the damage occurs, they shall have the right to resort to the rules of Article 29.

SECTION VII
Supply for Coffee Processing Plants, Sugar Mills, Mills, and Other Factories

Article 56.- Public waters granted to the owners of coffee processing plants, sugar mills, factories, and other industrial enterprises for the development of hydraulic or hydroelectric forces may not be used in the processing of their products without a special concession for that purpose. Nevertheless, users who on the date of the promulgation of this law were using public waters for these purposes may continue their use, being subject to the restrictions determined by Chapter VII and the obligations determined by Article 21.

Article 57.- Users or concessionaires must adhere to the police and health regulations regarding the surplus waters that are returned to their original channel, to avoid contamination or foul odors.

Those who do not comply with the regulations will lose the right to use the waters, in addition to penal sanctions.

(As amended by Article 1 of Law 17 of November 7, 1942)

SECTION VIII
Use for Navigation Canals

Article 58.- The authorization for a private society or company to canalize a river for the purpose of making it navigable or to construct a navigation canal shall always be granted by a law, in which it will be determined whether the work is to be assisted with State funds and the other conditions of the concession will be established.

Article 59.- The duration of these concessions may not exceed ninety-nine years, after which the State shall enter into the free and complete enjoyment of the works and the material in operation, in accordance with the conditions established in the concession.

Article 60.- After the first ten years of a canal being in operation, and successively every ten years, a review of the tariffs shall be carried out, unless the concession establishes otherwise.

Article 61.- The companies may at any time reduce the prices of the tariffs, with prior authorization from the Executive Branch. In this case, as well as in those of the preceding article, they shall be announced to the public, at least three months in advance of the day on which the changes are to take effect.

Article 62.- It shall be the obligation of the concessionaires to maintain the works in good condition, as well as the operation service, if it is under their charge.

When, due to failure to comply with this duty, navigation is made impossible, the Government shall set a period for the repair of the works and the replacement of the material; and once this has elapsed without the objective being achieved, it shall declare the concession lapsed.

SECTION IX
Ponds for Fish Farms

Article 63.- The construction of ponds for fish hatcheries on national property shall not be permitted except with legislative authorization, nor shall the impoundment of waters for the same purpose be permitted in navigable rivers, nor in springs destined for the supply of populations.

Article 64.- The impoundments of water must be subject to the police and hygiene regulations that are issued to prevent water contamination and for public safety.

Article 65.- If the works cause the flooding of private lands, the concession shall not be granted without the applicant first obtaining the corresponding permission from the owners of said lands.

Article 66.- In the event that the owners of others' estates refuse to grant the licenses, expropriation may be decreed, if the enterprise intended to be developed is of interest to the community.

Article 67.- Licenses may be granted for the formation of fish farms on beaches and inlets, provided they do not cause harm to navigation, free fishing, or the salt industry.

Article 68.- The application for a concession must be submitted with accompanying topographic plans, level studies, and other essential data that allow for an appreciation of the seriousness of the work being undertaken.

CHAPTER III
On Beaches, Maritime Zones, and Other National Property; On Zones of Private Property and Accessions

Article 69.- The maritime zone is understood as the space of the coasts of the Republic that the sea bathes in its ebb and flow and the immediate lands up to a distance of one mile, or one thousand six hundred and seventy-two meters, counted from the line marked by the high tide.

This maritime zone also extends along the banks of rivers to the point where they are navigable or the tides are perceptible, with a width of two hundred meters from each bank, counted from the line marked by the high tide.

The basin of a lake, lagoon, or estuary is understood as the deposit of the capacity necessary to contain the waters of the greatest ordinary floods. The bed or channel of a river or stream is understood as the land that its waters cover in the greatest ordinary floods.

Article 70.- The Nation holds the property of the waters determined in Article 1 of this law, of the beds or channels of the beaches and basins indicated in Article 3, as well as their banks. Consequently, the Nation, through the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, is the only one that can grant and regulate the use of the indicated goods, in accordance with the provisions of this law. The use of the goods in question shall be granted to private individuals, to civil or commercial societies admitted by the laws of the Republic, or to public law corporations, on the condition that the concessionaires establish regular works for their exploitation.

Regarding the exploitation of material deposits (sand, stone, gravel, and others) that accumulate in the channels, beaches, and basins of the public domain, they may be granted for a limited time by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy to public or private corporations admitted by the laws of the Republic, as well as to natural persons, on the condition that they establish regular and formal works of exploitation and submit to the regulations and provisions that the Ministry of the Environment and Energy establishes for these works.

The said Ministry may also authorize, upon payment of the fee to be fixed, the extraction of the said materials, for a fixed volume to be determined in each case, when at the site where the exploitation is to take place there are no other concessions.

The Ministry of the Environment and Energy shall fix in each concession the fee or exploitation rate, which must be paid in full and in advance for each quarter and shall be established by area of exploitation or by volume, as best suits the national interests.

The Central Government and the institutions of the State shall not pay this fee.

The Ministry of the Environment and Energy may grant total or partial exemption from the mentioned fee, in special cases where social reasons so warrant, at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

In the surveillance and control of the referred exploitations, the municipalities of the respective jurisdictions must collaborate with the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, without prejudice to the powers of the Ministry. The municipalities shall demand the presentation of the document that accredits the said concession or license, and failure to exhibit it will lead to the total stoppage of the exploitation works and the payment of a fine of up to two thousand colones (¢ 2,000.00), the proceeds of which shall be shared equally between the corresponding municipality and the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.

For the fulfillment of the tasks that, according to this law, correspond to the municipal corporations, the sums obtained by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy from the fees indicated above shall be distributed in equal parts between this institution and the municipality of the canton in which the deposits granted for exploitation are located. The Ministry shall remit semi-annually to each municipality the sums that correspond to it.

(As amended by Article 1 of Law No. 5046 of August 16, 1972, and by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 71.- The beaches and basins containing the waters determined in Article 5, belong to the owner of the land, as do the beds or channels in which these waters flow within the same land up to the boundary of the next property.

Article 72.- The Judges in charge of issuing property titles over uncultivated or untitled lands must make the consequent reservation regarding the waters, beds or channels, and basins of waters that are of public domain, making it a matter of record in the adjudication sentence of the lands, and the Public Registry must take note of these national reservations. The omission of this requirement does not confer any right to the claimant or possessor over these goods.

Article 73.- The banks of non-navigable rivers, and the margins of canals, aqueducts, or drains, even when they are of private domain, are subject in their entire extension to an easement of public use in favor of the water concessionaires of lower properties exclusively for the surveillance and cleaning of the beds or channels, and with prior notice in each case to the owner or person in charge of the property.

Article 74.- The lands that are joined to the maritime zone by the accessions and fillings caused by the sea are of public domain. When, as a consequence of these accessions and the effect of the sea's retreat, the interior line that limits the expressed zone advances towards it, the surplus lands of what was the old maritime zone will become the property of the State. In the event of an agreement to sell said lands, the owners of the adjoining lands will have preference.

Article 75.- The islands already formed or that may form in the maritime zone or in the navigable part of the rivers and in the estuaries and river mouths are the property of the State. But if these islands were to form from parts of one or several private properties, cut by a river, they will continue to belong to the owners of the dismembered property or properties.

Article 76.- Whatever the sea casts up belongs to the State, provided it consists of objects whose value is greater than fifty colones. Those worth less belong to the discoverer.

Article 77.- Titled lands that may be accidentally inundated by the waters of lakes, or by streams, rivers, and other currents, shall continue to be the property of their respective owners.

Article 78.- The beds of rivers that are abandoned by a natural change in the course of the waters belong to the owners of the respective properties along their entire length. If the abandoned channel separated estates of different owners, the new dividing line shall run equidistant from one and the other.

Article 79.- When a navigable or floatable river naturally changes its direction and opens a new channel in private property, this channel shall enter the public domain. The owner of the property shall recover it, provided that the waters return to leave it dry, either naturally or by legally authorized works for that purpose. Navigable rivers shall be understood as those included in Article 53, and floatable rivers as those same rivers in the part where only the use of flat-bottomed boats is possible.

Article 80.- Public channels that become dry as a consequence of works authorized by special concession belong to the concessionaires, if they are included within the lands subject to the concession and if nothing else is established in the respective contract.

Article 81.- When the current of a stream, torrent, or river segregates a known portion of land from its bank and transports it to the adjoining or lower estates, the owner of the property that bordered the segregated bank retains ownership of the transported portion of land, provided there is no confusion with lands of those estates.

Article 82.- If the known portion of land segregated from a bank remains isolated in the channel, it continues to belong unconditionally to the owner of the land from whose bank it was segregated.

The same shall occur when a river, dividing into a stream, surrounds and isolates some lands.

Article 83.- The islands that, by successive accumulation of upstream deposits, are formed in the channels, belong to the State if they are navigable rivers, or to the owners of the banks in other cases. If the island forms on one side of the midline of the river, it shall belong to the owner of the riparian land, and if it forms in the middle of the river, it shall then be divided longitudinally by halves, each half belonging to the owners of the riparian lands on either side. In any case, the midline shall serve to mark the respective rights of the owners.

Article 84.- Except for what is stated in Article 81, the accretion that the lands bordering streams, torrents, rivers, and lakes gradually receive through accession or sedimentation of the waters belongs to the owners of said lands.

Article 85.- Anyone may collect and save animals, wood, fruits, furniture, and other products of industry, carried away by the currents of public waters or submerged in them, presenting them immediately to the local authority, who will arrange for their deposit or their sale at public auction when they cannot be preserved. The finding shall be announced immediately; and if within a year there is a claim by the owner, the object or its price will be delivered to them, after payment of the costs of conservation and the salvage right, which shall consist of ten percent. Once that period has elapsed without the owner having claimed it, they will lose this right, and everything will be returned to the one who saved it.

Article 86.- The brushwood, branches, and firewood that are floating in the waters or are deposited by them in the channel or on public domain lands belong to the first person who collects them; those left on private domain lands belong to the owner of the respective properties.

Article 87.- Trees uprooted and transported by the current of the waters belong to the owner of the land where they come to rest, if their former owners do not claim them within a month, who, prior to delivery, must pay the expenses incurred in collecting the trees or placing them in a safe place.

Article 88.- Objects submerged in public channels continue to belong to their owners; but if within a year they do not extract them, they shall belong to the persons who carry out the extraction, with prior permission from the authority. If the submerged objects present an obstacle to the currents or to transit, a prudent period shall be granted by the authority to the owners; if after this period has elapsed the owners do not make use of their right, the extraction shall proceed as if of abandoned property.

The owner of objects submerged in waters of private property shall request permission from the owner of these waters to extract them; and in the case that the latter refuses, the political authority of the place shall grant the permission, upon a bond for damages and losses that will be provided before it.

CHAPTER IV
On Defense Works and Land Drainage

Article 89.- The owners of properties bordering public channels are free to place defenses against the waters on their respective banks by means of plantations, stakes, or revetments, whenever they deem it convenient. The administration may, however, after due process, order the suspension of such works and even restore things to their former state, when circumstances threaten to cause damage to the navigation or flotation of the rivers, divert the currents from their natural course, or produce floods. The compensation for damages that may be caused shall be borne by the owner who ordered the construction of the defenses.

Article 90.- The owners of lagoons or swampy or waterlogged lands, who wish to drain or reclaim them, may extract from public lands, with the corresponding authorization from the local authority, the earth and stone indispensable for the embankment and other works.

Article 91.- When the lagoons or swampy lands belong to several owners and, partial drainage not being possible, several of them intend for the work to be carried out in common, all the owners may be obliged to contribute collectively to the works intended for that purpose, provided that the majority agrees, this being understood as those who represent the greater extent of reclaimable land. If any of the owners refuse to pay and prefer to cede their part of the reclaimable property to the owners, they may do so through the corresponding compensation.

Article 92.- When a lagoon or swampy or waterlogged land is declared unhealthy by the competent authority, its drainage or reclamation is mandatory. If it is private property, the owners will be notified of the resolution so that they may arrange for the drainage or reclamation within the period indicated to them.

Article 93.- If the owner or the majority of the owners refuse to execute the drainage, any private individual or company that offers to carry it out may be entrusted with it, upon approval of the corresponding project. The reclaimed land will become the property of whoever has carried out the drainage or reclamation, but paying the former owners the sum corresponding to the acquisition price of the land.

In the case that the owners of the swampy lands declared unhealthy do not wish to execute the drainage, and there is no private individual or company that offers to carry it out, the State or the Municipality may execute the works, financing them with the funds allocated for that purpose in their respective budgets. When this occurs, the State or the Municipality will enjoy the same benefits determined by the preceding article, in the manner and form established therein, being consequently subject to the prescriptions that govern this class of goods.

CHAPTER V

SECTION I
On Natural Easements

Article 94.- The lower lands are obliged to receive the waters that naturally, and without the intervention of man, flow from the upper ones, as well as the earth or stones that they carry in their course. But if the waters are the product of artificial extractions, or surplus from irrigation channels, or from industrial establishments that have not acquired this easement, the owner of the property that receives the waters will have the right to demand compensation for damages and losses, unless he wishes to take advantage of the waters he receives on his land, in which case he has no right to such compensation.

The owners of lower properties or establishments may refuse to receive the surplus from industrial establishments that carry or dissolve noxious or foul substances, introduced by the owners of these. They will present the corresponding claim before the respective police authority for this purpose.

Article 95.- The owner of the property that receives the waters has the right to build within it banks, embankments, or walls that, without impeding the course of the waters, serve to regulate them or to take advantage of them in his case.

Article 96.- In the same way, the owner of the upper property may construct within it banks, embankments, or walls that, without encumbering the easement of the lower property, soften the currents of the waters, preventing them from carrying away the topsoil, or causing damage to the property.

Article 97.- The course of the outlet of the waters from an extraction may not be varied without prior agreement with the owner of the lower property, unless the Ministry of the Environment and Energy resolves otherwise.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 98.- When water accumulates on a property stones, debris, or other objects that, by hindering its natural course, may cause damming with floods, diversion of the waters, or other damages, the interested parties may demand that the owner of the property remove the obstruction, or that he allow them to remove it.

If there is cause for compensation for damages, it shall be the responsibility of the causer.

SECTION II
On Legal Easements

I.-General Provisions

Article 99.- When a person who wishes to use public waters does not obtain from the neighbors the corresponding license for the construction of the works necessary for the use, they may appeal to the Secretariat of State in the Office of Government requesting the imposition of the respective easement.

Article 100.- The easements are:

I.- Of aqueduct;

II.- Of dam abutment and of stopgate or diversion; and

III.- Of watering place and of water drawing.

Article 101.- Upon receipt of the request, the Secretariat shall grant a hearing to the owner of the property to be affected. The owner may oppose within the following thirty days, for any of the following reasons:

1st.- For the applicant not being a concessionaire of the water or owner of the land where they intend to use it for private interest purposes; and

2nd.- For being able to establish the easement on other properties with equal advantages for the one who intends to impose it and lesser inconveniences for the one who has to suffer it.

Article 102.- Upon answering the hearing, the owner of the property to be affected will propose his evidence and, once this is evaluated, as well as that offered by the applicant within the eight days following the expiration of the said hearing, the Secretariat will issue its resolution in which it will necessarily fix the amount of the compensation to which the injured party is entitled. This will be fixed by three experts, one appointed by each party and a third by the Secretary of State, unless the parties agree on the appointment of two or one, only.

Article 103.- Once the compensation is satisfied, the resolution will be executed, against which no other recourse is available than the declaratory judgment provided for in Chapter XIII of this law.

II.-Special Rules on the Easement of Aqueduct

Article 104.- The compulsory easement of aqueduct cannot be imposed for objects of private interest on constructions or buildings, nor on gardens, nor on orchards existing at the time of making the request, unless the importance of the work justifies the measure in the judgment of the Secretariat of Government.

Article 105.- Nor may the compulsory easement of aqueduct take place within another pre-existing aqueduct; but if the owner of the latter consents and the owner of the servient estate refuses, the latter may be compelled to it.

Article 106.- When an irrigated piece of land that receives water from a single point is divided by inheritance, sale, or other title between two or more owners, those of the upper part are obliged to give passage to the water as an easement of aqueduct for the irrigation of the lower ones, without being able to demand compensation for it, unless otherwise agreed.

Article 107.- The compulsory easement of aqueduct shall be constituted:

I.- With an open channel when it is not dangerous due to its depth or location, nor offers other inconveniences;

II.- With a covered channel when its depth, its contiguity to dwellings or roads, or some other analogous reason, so requires, in the judgment of the corresponding local political authority; and

III.- With a pipe or tubing when other already appropriated waters may be absorbed, when the conveyed waters may infect others, absorb noxious substances, or cause damage to works or buildings, and provided that, from the file that is formed for this purpose, it is justified.

Article 108.- The compulsory easement of aqueduct may be established temporarily or perpetually. It shall be understood as perpetual, for the effects of this law, when its duration exceeds six years.

Article 109.- If the easement is temporary, double the rent corresponding to the duration of the encumbrance for the part it occupies shall be paid in advance to the owner of the land, with the addition of the amount of damages and imperfections to the rest of the property, including those arising from its fragmentation by the interposition of the channel. In addition, it shall be the responsibility of the owner of the dominant estate to restore things to their former state, once the easement is terminated. If it is perpetual, the value of the occupied land and that of the damages and losses that may be caused to the rest of the property shall be paid.

Article 110.- The temporary easement cannot be extended, but it can be converted into perpetual, without the need for a new concession, if the concessionaire pays what is established in the preceding article, after deducting what was paid for the temporary easement.

Article 111.- All necessary works for its construction, conservation, and cleaning shall be at the expense of the one who has promoted and obtained the easement of aqueduct. For this purpose, he shall be authorized to temporarily occupy the indispensable lands for the deposit of materials, with prior compensation for damages and losses, or sufficient bond in case these are not easy to foresee, or if the interested parties do not agree with it. These, or the administration, may compel him to execute the necessary works and clearings to prevent stagnation or infiltrations that may cause deterioration.

Article 112.- Upon establishing the compulsory easement of aqueduct, the width that the channel and its banks must have shall be fixed, in view of the nature and configuration of the land, according to the amount of water to be conveyed. If, due to the channel being of ancient construction, or for other reasons, the width of its course is not determined, it shall be fixed according to the preceding bases, when any of the interested parties so requests.

Article 113.- Inherent to the compulsory easement of aqueduct is the right of way along its banks, for its exclusive service.

Article 114.- If the aqueduct crosses public or private ways, of whatever nature they may be, the one who has obtained the concession shall be obliged to construct and maintain the necessary culverts and bridges; and if it has to cross other aqueducts, it shall be done in such a way that it does not delay or accelerate the course of the waters, nor diminish their flow, nor adulterate their quality.

Article 115.- When the owner of an aqueduct that crosses others' lands requests to increase its capacity to receive a greater flow of water, the same rules as for its establishment shall be used.

Article 116.- The owner of an aqueduct may fortify its banks with turf, stakes, walls, or embankments of loose stone, but not with plantations of any kind. The owner of the servient estate may not make any plantation or operation on the same banks; and the roots that penetrate them may be cut by the owner of the aqueduct.

Article 117.- The easement of aqueduct does not prevent the owner of the servient estate from closing and fencing it, as well as building over the aqueduct itself, in such a way that it does not suffer damage nor are the necessary repairs and cleanings made impossible. The owner of the aqueduct shall make them opportunely, giving advance notice to the owner, lessee, or administrator of the servient estate. If for the cleaning and clearing it is essential to demolish part of a building, the cost of its repair shall be borne by the one who has built over the aqueduct, in case of not having left the corresponding openings or apertures for that service.

Article 118.- The owner of the servient estate may build bridges over the aqueduct to pass from one part of the property to another, but he shall do so with the necessary solidity and in such a way that the dimensions of the aqueduct are not diminished nor the course of the water hindered.

Article 119.- In every channel or aqueduct, the water, the course, the side walls, and the banks shall be considered an integral part of the estate or building to which the waters are destined.

Article 120.- No one may, except in the cases specified in the preceding articles, build a building or bridge over another's channel or aqueduct, nor derive water, nor take advantage of its products or those of its banks, nor use the force of the current, without the express consent of the owner, except for what is said in the following part.

Nor may the owners of the properties that a channel or aqueduct crosses, or along whose boundaries it runs, allege a right of possession to the use of its course or banks, unless based on property titles expressive of such a right; but the Ministry of the Environment and Energy may use them to utilize the waters of the channels or aqueducts, insofar as this does not harm the owners of the respective easements, determining, in each case, the modalities of the use that is authorized and the obligations that it implies.

(As amended by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 121.- The concession of the legal easement of aqueduct over others' properties shall lapse if within the period that has been fixed the concessionaire does not make use of it after the valuation has been satisfied to the owner of each servient estate.

The established easement shall be extinguished:

I.- By consolidation, that is, when the dominion of the waters and the lands affected by the easement are united in a single person;

II.- By the expiration of the period of six years fixed in the concession of the temporary easement; and

III.- By non-use during the period of ten years, either due to impossibility or negligence on the part of the owner of the easement, or due to acts of the servient estate contrary to it, without contradiction from the dominant one.

The use of the easement of aqueduct by any of the co-owners preserves the right for all, preventing prescription due to lack of use.

Once a temporary easement of aqueduct is extinguished by the passage of time and the expiration of the term, the owner of it shall only have the right to take advantage of things as they were before the easement was constituted.

The same shall be understood with respect to the perpetual aqueduct, whose easement is extinguished due to impossibility or disuse.

Article 122.- The urban easements of aqueduct, canal, bridge, sewer, drain, and others, established for the public and private service of populations, buildings, gardens, and factories, shall be governed by the general and local ordinances of urban police. Those proceeding from private contracts that do not affect the attributions of the Municipalities shall be governed by the common laws.

III.-Special rules for the easement of dam abutment, and of stopgate or diversion

Article 123.- In the same cases as the easement of aqueduct, the compulsory easement of abutment may be imposed, when the one who intends to build a dam is not the owner of the banks or lands where it is to be supported.

Article 124.- Once the compulsory easement of dam abutment is decreed, the owner of the servient estate or estates shall be paid the value corresponding to the occupation of the land; and afterwards, he shall be indemnified for the damages and losses that the properties may have experienced.

Article 125.- Whoever, in order to irrigate his estate or to improve it, needs to construct a stopgate or diversion in the channel or irrigation ditch through which he is to receive it without vexation or reduction for the other irrigators, may demand of the owners of the banks that they permit its construction, with prior payment of damages and losses, including those that originate in the new easement.

IV.-Special rules for the easement of watering place and water drawing

Article 126.- The compulsory easements of watering place and water drawing may only be imposed for reasons of public utility in favor of some population or hamlet, with prior corresponding compensation.

Article 127.- The easements referred to in the preceding article shall not be imposed in the future on ordinary wells, cisterns or reservoirs, or on buildings or lands enclosed by a wall.

Article 128.- The easements of watering place and water drawing entail the obligation, on the servient estates, to give passage to persons and livestock to the property where they are to be exercised, with the compensation also being extended to this service.

Article 129.- The prescriptions established for the granting of aqueduct easements are applicable to the concessions of this class of easement; upon decreeing them, the width of the path or trail that is to lead to the watering place or point designated for drawing water shall be fixed, according to its object and the circumstances of the locality.

Article 130.- The owners of the servient estates may vary the direction of the path or trail intended for the use of these easements, but not its width or entrance and, in any case, without the variation harming the use of the easement.

CHAPTER SIX
User Associations

Article 131.- User associations may be formed for the collective use of public waters. Their operation and liquidation shall be adjusted, in what is not determined in this chapter and their own nature does not oppose it, to what the law provides for cooperatives. They must be registered in the Registry that the Ministry of the Environment and Energy will keep for this purpose, with the obligation to immediately communicate to it all changes in statutes and movements of the Board of Directors and of surveillance. Only their constitution shall be published in summary in the Official Gazette. For the registration, every association must pay to the Ministry of the Environment and Energy a fee of one hundred colones and for every subsequent modification or operation 50% of that sum.

User associations shall require for their formation a number of no less than five members, who may be owners or lessees of lands.

The formation of a user association for the collective use of public waters shall be necessary when, in the judgment of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, the number of people who use a source, its volume, or the special circumstances of the use of the waters, indicate that it is more beneficial to the public interest and that of the private parties to use it in that form.

(As Amended by Article 1 of Law No. 5516 of May 2, 1972, and by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 132.- User associations, once registered, shall enjoy legal personality for all purposes and especially to:

a) Obtain concessions for the use of waters in accordance with the prescriptions of this law;

b) Construct works for irrigation, motive power, watering places, and any other use of the waters;

c) Obtain the necessary funds to construct the works they plan through the contribution of their members; and

d) Acquire the necessary real estate for the proper purposes of the association and accept and possess the easements that are constituted in its favor.

They may not possess or administer by themselves agricultural, industrial, or commercial exploitations, nor engage in other activities than those proper to their object. The regulation of the use of the waters by its members shall be determined in the respective concession, or by a subsequent provision of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, and the right to their use by the members shall be done in any case seeking the greatest equality and equity.

The share capital shall be divided into shares and the liability of the members is limited to the amount of their contributions for this concept. They shall be nominative, common, and for a value of the chosen monetary unit or its multiples.

(As Amended by Article 1 of Law No. 5516 of May 2, 1972, and by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 133.- User associations shall be constituted by public deed which shall contain the following data:

a) Name and surnames, general information, and identity card of the constituents, or the name of the legal persons involved;

b) Name, domicile, object, and duration of the same, which may be indefinite; the capital and the form in which the shares are subscribed and paid, and their part and form of payment of the outstanding balance;

c) Requirements for the admission of new members and causes for separation or exclusion and manner of transferring the shares;

d) Number of members of the Board of Directors and of surveillance;

e) Resources available to the association;

f) Form and term of dissolution or liquidation;

g) Other conventions of interest to the members;

h) Integration of the first Board of Directors and of Surveillance; and

i) Place and date of constitution.

(As Amended by Article 1 of Law No. 5516 of May 2, 1972).

Article 134.- The functioning of user associations shall be in accordance with what is determined by this law and its regulations and the provisions relating to cooperatives in what is not prescribed, subject to the following bases:

a) The supreme authority shall be the General Assembly of Members, with one vote corresponding to each member;

b) The administration and direction shall be in charge of a Board of Directors composed of at least three members, appointed in the General Assembly by a relative majority of votes, for a period of up to five years, and may be re-elected. There will also be a Surveillance Board composed of at least two members elected in the same manner and for an equal period. When the number of members allows, there will be the substitutes agreed upon to replace the absences of the members of both boards.

The Board of Directors may only commit the credit of the association and execute works with the authorization of the General Assembly;

c) The President of the Board of Directors shall have the legal representation of the association, with the powers of a general attorney in accordance with Article 1255 of the Civil Code and shall be the executor of the agreements of the General Assembly and the Board of Directors;

d) The General Assembly must meet at least once a year, within the three months following the end of the annual period and extraordinarily whenever the Board of Directors convenes it. The quorum for both will be formed by half plus one of its members. In the case of being five members, the quorum will be three. The agreements of the General Assembly and the Board of Directors will be taken by a relative majority of votes. The call to the General Assembly will be made by letter at least three days in advance.

The minutes of the Assemblies will be signed by the attending members;

e) The Board of Directors must meet at least every month and also when the activities of the association demand it. The quorum will be formed by half plus one of its members, and in the case of being three, it will be two, and in the case of being five, it will be three. In the first meeting, matters relating to them will be determined, fixing the place of meeting;

f) Both the general assemblies and the meetings of the Board of Directors will be presided over by its President, and in his absence, by the member designated by those present.

g) The surveillance board must meet at least once a year, to report to the General Assembly. When it deems a special report convenient, it will proceed to convene the General Assembly through the Board of Directors, and in case of refusal by the latter, it may do so itself;

h) The Ministry of the Environment and Energy may intervene at the request of a party, for the solution of difficulties or conflicts of interest of the members among themselves or of these with the association, and may exercise functions of arbitrator. It may intervene ex officio when it considers that the association does not fulfill its purposes in accordance with the laws and the terms of the concession, without prejudice to exercising the legal actions of the case. Its decisions in this case have the limits of its competence;

i) The Board of Directors may make the necessary regulations for the good management of the association, which, once approved by the General Assembly and the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, will have the force of law for the members;

j) If for any reason the members of the Board of Directors are not timely elected, the previous ones will continue in their functions until they are legally replaced, and an Extraordinary General Assembly must be called as soon as possible to proceed with the corresponding designation. For third parties and for the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, it is understood that the members of the registered Board of Directors continue in their functions if, upon the expiration of their term, no change has been communicated;

k) The agreements of the Board of Directors of the user association on expenses and fixing of quotas for the construction of works or for maintenance, shall be of mandatory compliance for all members;

l) All costs of construction, exploitation, cleaning, conservation, improvement, and other works carried out for the benefit of the associates, shall be at their expense, pro-rated according to their rights to the water. The expenses that are for the benefit of certain members will be at their exclusive expense, also pro-rated according to their rights to the water;

ll) Members in arrears in the payment of their quotas or contributions shall be deprived of water during the default, without prejudice to collection through the respective legal channel. They will also be responsible for the costs demanded by the services of the authority that may be necessary to commission to apply and monitor the deprivation of water;

m) New users who have not contributed to the payment of the collective benefit works built by a user association, shall pay upon entering, for the benefit of the association, a sum fixed by the Board of Directors in reasonable terms;

n) If any member, by himself or through an intermediary, alters a distribution device, it will be restored at the member's expense, who will also suffer the deprivation of water until he pays that expense and any other sanction provided for in the statutes.

The same rules will apply to members who carry out works to increase their water supply. The beneficiary of these acts is presumed to be the author;

ñ) Members are obliged to contribute the necessary sums to carry out the works corresponding to the granted use, in the amount fixed by the General Assembly, as well as to contribute with periodic sums for the maintenance of the same and other administration expenses. The proven failure of this obligation may lead to the expulsion of the member and the loss of the benefits of the use.

(As Amended by Article 1 of Law No. 5516 of May 2, 1972, and by Transitory Provision V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 135.- The acceptance of membership status implies the obligation to grant any of the legal easements referred to in Section Two of Chapter Five of this law, over the properties owned by the member, which may not be revoked even if the member ceases to hold such status. A certification from the Registry attesting to the membership status, or any other authentic corporate document with the same attestation, shall serve as an executive title for the corresponding Civil Judge to grant the easement in the event of the member's default.

(As amended by Article 1 of Law No. 5516 of May 2, 1972).

Article 136.- Collectives of water concessionaires may be established in the same region when they are supplied by the same source or springs. These collectives may be established by public deed, and the provisions of this chapter shall apply to them insofar as they are applicable.

CHAPTER SEVEN

Modifications to Water Uses and Regulation of Currents

Article 137.- The Ministry of Environment and Energy, acting ex officio or at the request of a party, is authorized to modify, without being subject to payment of damages for any reason, the rights to the use of public waters, regardless of the title that supports the use, irrigation, industrial uses, and motive power, in the following cases:

a) If the waters are needed for pipelines, for the supply of populations, watering troughs, baths, or other public services or transport system supplies. The applicants will have to prove to the Ministry of Environment and Energy that they do not have another economically usable source of supply for this purpose;

b) When required by compliance with special laws enacted in favor of populations or agriculture;

c) When regulating the waters of a current, reservoir, or a collective use; and

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

Of the competence of the Common Courts in matters of waters

Article 199.- The applicant for a concession or the opponent, as the case may be, may file an ordinary lawsuit against the Ministry of Environment and Energy and jointly against the concessionaire before the Civil Court of Finance, so that the courts may hear the issues resolved by the Ministry, in relation to said concession or opposition.

The same right corresponds to a third party who believes they are prejudiced by the administrative resolution that confirms rights over waters.

(As amended by Transitory V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 200.- The resolutions that are issued modifying uses, declaring their expiration, or the nullity of a title, may be discussed in the same way through a declarative judgment. The resolutions to which this and the preceding article refer may be claimed for any of the following reasons:

I.- Because the legal cause on which the resolution was based did not exist; and

II.- Because the fact or omission invoked in the referred resolutions as the basis for the pronouncement is not exact or certain.

The simple appreciation of the facts made in the resolution of the Ministry of Environment and Energy may not be discussed again before the Courts nor varied by them.

(As amended by Transitory V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 201.- The Civil Court of Finance is also competent to hear the declarative judgment that is promoted due to the resolutions issued by the Ministry of Environment and Energy in the matters entrusted to it in Chapter Eleven of this law, in the following cases:

I.- When the expiration or modification of a concession made to individuals or companies is declared in the terms prescribed by this law;

II.- When rights acquired by virtue of provisions emanating from the Ministry of Environment and Energy are harmed by it;

III.- When a forced easement or some limitation or encumbrance is imposed on private property in the terms prescribed by this law; and

IV.- In the questions that arise regarding compensation for damages as a consequence of the limitations and encumbrances mentioned in the preceding paragraph.

(As amended by Transitory V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 202.- The ordinary trial also proceeds in the terms indicated in the preceding articles in cases where the resolutions of the Ministry of Environment and Energy have been issued on concessions of waters destined to develop forces or their expiration in accordance with Law No. 258 of August 18, 1941, and in those that are pronounced modifying concessions in accordance with Chapter Seven of this law.

(As amended by Transitory V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 203.- The actions referred to in the preceding articles may not be established after one year counted from the date of the concession or from when it acquires a definitive character according to Article 183.

Article 204.- In the cases determined in the preceding articles, the service of the lawsuit will be notified to the Director or Subdirector of the Ministry of Environment and Energy, and that entity may appoint an attorney-in-fact in court or request the Public Ministry to present one, in case the Director or Subdirector does not assume the representation in court. The mandate will be constituted by means of an official letter addressed to the Judge who hears the matter, signed by the Director or Subdirector of the organization. This person will have the right to litigate on plain paper and will not be obliged to post a bond for costs, nor to pay them, nor the consequent damages.

(As amended by Transitory V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 205.- The Courts that exercise civil jurisdiction are competent to hear the questions that arise exclusively between individuals, relating to:

I.- The right over public waters and the domain over private waters and their possession;

II.- The right over the beaches, basins of lakes, beds or channels of rivers, and the right and possession of the banks, without prejudice to the competence of the Ministry of Environment and Energy to demarcate and delimit what belongs to the public domain;

III.- To water and passage easements through the margins, founded on titles of civil law; and

IV.- To the right of fishing.

(As amended by Transitory V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 206.- It also corresponds to the civil justice courts the knowledge of the questions raised between individuals regarding preference in the right of use according to this law:

I.- Of rainwater; and

II.- Of other waters outside their natural channels when the preference is based on titles of civil law.

Article 207.- The same civil courts are also competent to hear the questions relating to damages caused to individuals in their rights:

I.- For the opening of ordinary wells;

II.- For the opening of artesian wells and for the execution of subterranean works; and

III.- For all kinds of uses in favor of individuals.

Article 208.- The term to file the lawsuits referred to in the three preceding articles will be one year counted from the date of publication of the resolution that causes the reason for the dispute; and in the cases of the resolutions referred to in chapter twelve, the year will be counted from when the resolution is issued, if this has been notified to the claimant or from when he begins to make use of the use if it has not been notified personally.

Article 209.- When the question relating to the right and enjoyment of the waters is not by its nature of an essentially civil character, if the disputed rights are based on an administrative concession, it is not possible for the Courts to resolve any question of a private nature as long as their jurisdiction does not appear free and clear by resolutions of the Ministry of Environment and Energy or of the Cantonal Water Inspectors that can serve as a basis for the decision of the civil question raised, given the nature of the disputed titles; and until such resolutions are issued, the judicial demand will be untimely.

(As amended by Transitory V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 210.- Questions of law, when a declaration of definitive possession of public waters is sought, or the vindication of the possession of rights of private waters, fall within the competence of the Ordinary Courts.

Article 211.- In cases of forced expropriation prescribed in this law, action before the Courts is only possible when the corresponding compensation has not preceded the eviction, or when the expropriation has been decreed without observing the legal prescriptions that regulate the matter.

Article 212.- In matters of water, interdictal action will not be possible. The questions that arise will be resolved in accordance with the provisions of this law.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

General Provisions

Article 213.- This law repeals No. 11 of May 26, 1884, and all those that oppose the present one. The current concessionaires of waters will continue to enjoy their concessions as long as the collective interest does not require the imposition of restrictions or limitations on the current rights.

The right of the populations is declared of public interest and to achieve it, either the processing of the instance in accordance with what is prescribed in Chapter VII is required, or the expropriation decreed in accordance with the current procedures and prior compensation for the injured rights.

Article 214.- The concessions given by virtue of legally approved contracts will not be subject to restriction, unless it is proven that the currents that provide the contracted services excessively serve the purposes for which they are intended, and in that case, the surpluses may be disposed of in the order established in Article 27.

Article 215.- All concessionaires of public waters, whatever the title under which their rights are protected, are obliged:

I.- To execute the works ordered by the Ministry of Environment and Energy to limit the volumes they use to make the distribution of the waters, to improve the stability of the works, and in general to obtain the good management and better use of the waters;

II.- Not to alter or change, without prior authorization from the Ministry of Environment and Energy, the nature of the use or exploitation, or the location, capacity, and conditions in which the respective hydraulic works have been approved;

III.- To contribute to the expenses that are necessary to incur in the conservation of the water channels and in the construction of their defense works;

IV.- To be subject to the police and surveillance regulations issued by the Executive Branch; and

V.- To pay the taxes that are fixed for the use of the waters. The failure to pay these taxes and rights may be sanctioned, where appropriate, with the suspension of the use of the waters and even with the expiration of the permits or relative titles.

(As amended by Transitory V of Law No. 7593 of August 9, 1996)

Article 216.- This law is effective from its publication.

Transitory.- All the Municipalities of the Republic are obliged to send to the (*)Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications a list of the water concessions they have granted in their respective cantons, with a copy of the respective agreement.

(*)(As amended by Article 19 of the Framework Law of Concession for the Use of Hydraulic Forces for Hydroelectric Generation, No. 8723 of April 22, 2009).

Article 2.- For its application in the present law, Article 57 of Law No. 258 of August 18, 1941, is modified, which will be read as follows:

The concessions for water and hydraulic and electric power uses will pay the following fees: a fixed fee of one colón for every ten liters or fraction of water to be granted, or ten colones for each horsepower or fraction to be used in hydraulic or electric power. Equal sums will be charged upon granting an extension or approving a transfer of the granted concessions. In addition, all concessions for hydraulic and electric power will pay semi-annually and in advance, unless there is a commitment to charge a lower rate, one colón for each horsepower, provided that the power does not exceed fifty horsepower, and two colones for each horsepower when it is greater than that amount. The concessions for hydraulic or electric power, intended for agricultural purposes and within the property of the concessionaire, including lighting, heating services, etc., will only pay half of the taxes indicated in the preceding paragraph regarding the fee for concession rights and the same tax regarding the semi-annual fee, provided that it does not exceed one hundred horsepower without being duplicated.

If the indicated fee is not paid during a semester, it may be paid during the following, with a twenty-five percent surcharge or during the third with a fifty percent surcharge. If three semesters pass without the total payments having been made, with the respective fines, the concession of the debtor hydraulic or electric power will lapse.

The National Electricity Board will not grant new electric concessions to those companies that are not up to date in the payment of interest or dividends to their resident shareholders in the country; and the Export Control Office will not authorize the sending abroad of any amount as payment of interest, amortization, or dividend, as long as it is not justified that said concession has been complied with.
