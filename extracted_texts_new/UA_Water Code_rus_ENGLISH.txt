All waters (water bodies) on the territory of Ukraine are the national heritage of the Ukrainian people, one of the natural foundations of its economic development and social well-being. Water resources ensure the existence of people, fauna, and flora and are limited and vulnerable natural objects. In the context of increasing anthropogenic pressures on the natural environment, the development of social production, and the growth of material needs, it is necessary to develop and comply with special rules for the use of water resources, their rational use, and environmentally-oriented protection. The Water Code, in conjunction with organizational, legal, economic, and educational measures, will contribute to the formation of a water-ecological legal order and ensure the ecological safety of the population of Ukraine, as well as the more effective, scientifically-based use of waters and their protection from pollution, contamination, and depletion.
