of watercourses, their riverbanks and, where applicable, their mobility zones;

of wetlands, bodies of water, and areas mentioned in the third indent of Article 18 of this law;

of works and lands mentioned in Article 18 of this law, fourth to seventh indents.

Article 25: Decrees in the council of ministers shall determine the modalities for compensating owners and other holders of land rights who must suffer a direct, material, and certain prejudice from the classification of their lands among the dependencies of the public water domain following a modification of its limits, whether this modification results from the provisions of this law or from an artificial or natural change in the course or regime of the waters.

The decrees mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall also fix the conditions under which persons to whom the effective application of the legislative provisions relating to the public water domain would cause a direct, material, and certain prejudice that calls into question recognized customary practices may be compensated.

This article applies neither to fishing nor to human settlements in lacustrine areas, which remain subject to the legislative and regulatory provisions in force.

CHAPTER IV
PROSPECTIVE AND CONSERVATION PROVISIONS

Article 26: With a view to the conservation of water resources, the State and territorial authorities shall ensure, over time and space, a balance between the availability of the water resource in quantity and quality and the needs to be satisfied according to the various uses and functions of water.

To this end, the ministry shall coordinate the implementation of the policy defined by the State in conjunction with the other competent ministries as well as with the territorial authorities.

Article 27: The ministry shall carry out a quantitative and qualitative inventory of water and shall ensure its monitoring.

The inventory data as well as the measures planned for their collection and analysis shall be subject to periodic review.

Article 30: The planning tools necessary for the sustainable management of water are:

the national water policy;

the national action plan for integrated water resource management and the master plan for water resource development and management.

CHAPTER VII
FINANCING WATER MANAGEMENT

SECTION ONE
GENERAL PROVISIONS

Article 31: A public establishment endowed with legal personality called the national water fund is created in the Republic of Benin.

Article 32: A decree in the council of ministers shall determine the missions, organization, and functioning of the national water fund.

Article 33: The resources of the national water fund are constituted by:

allocations from the general budget of the State;

the product of the fees provided for in Articles 35 and 37 of this law;

the product of the taxes established for water management;

the product of fines imposed in application of this law;

subsidies, donations, and legacies;

any other resources authorized by law.

SECTION II
SYSTEM OF FEES AND CONTRIBUTIONS

Article 34: In application of the "user-pays" principle stated in Articles 7 and 8 of this law, natural or legal persons who use water for purposes other than domestic may be subject to the payment of a financial contribution calculated on the basis of the volume of water withdrawn, consumed, or mobilized; this contribution must primarily serve to finance the water sector.

The determination of the persons subject or exempted, the activities concerned, the amount, and the administrative and accounting rules applicable to this contribution shall take into consideration the social, economic, cultural, and ecological importance of the activity in question, the revenues and profits of any kind that may result from it, as well as the collective charges it imposes, particularly on the State and on other public persons, in matters of water management.

These provisions also apply to non-public domain waters used for purposes other than domestic.

Article 35: On the proposal of the ministers in charge of finance and water, a decree in the council of ministers shall specify domestic uses, fix their thresholds, and define, where applicable, the conditions under which certain domestic uses may be subject to a financial contribution.

Article 36: Contributions resulting from the application of the "polluter-pays" principle stated in Article 14 of this law are proportional to the importance of the pollution or degradation in question. They may be reduced on account of the provisions taken by the payers to remedy it and do not exclude the benefit of public aid aimed at the same ends.

The payment of a contribution determined in application of the above provisions does not prevent the engagement of the civil or criminal liability of the payer when their activity is at the origin of a damage or constitutes an offense.

Article 37: In the event of accidental water pollution, the public entities that have intervened materially or financially are entitled to reimbursement, by the person or persons responsible for the accident, of the expenses incurred to mitigate or prevent the aggravation of the damage.

The reimbursement of the sums due is made without prejudice to the reparation of other damages.

Article 38: The modalities of application of the preceding provisions shall be the subject of a decree in the council of ministers, on a joint proposal from the ministers in charge respectively of finance, water, and the environment, and from the ministers whose attributions correspond to the activity for which a fee or a financial contribution is envisaged.

CHAPTER IX
SPECIAL PROTECTIONS

SECTION ONE
PROTECTION OF WATER INTAKES AND ABSTRACTIONS

Article 47: In order to ensure the protection of water quality, the authorization for works, installations, and structures created for the withdrawal of surface or groundwater, or the authorization for these withdrawals themselves, shall provide for appropriate protection measures.

These measures are also determined in the case of withdrawals subject to declaration, when the withdrawn water is totally or partially intended for consumption.

Article 48: In the case of groundwater withdrawals, the protection measures referred to in Article 47 above include the delimitation around the withdrawal point of an immediate protection perimeter, a close protection perimeter and, as needed, a distant protection perimeter.

Article 49: The lands included in the immediate protection perimeter are acquired in full ownership by the State. The State or the concessionaire of the public drinking water supply service is responsible for fencing them and ensuring that they are exclusively used for water withdrawal and regularly maintained for this purpose.

Within the close protection perimeters, deposits, installations, and activities likely to directly or indirectly harm the quality of the water or render it unfit for consumption are prohibited.

The prohibition specifically concerns deposits of garbage, refuse, and detritus, the spreading of manure, deposits of hydrocarbons and all substances presenting risks of toxicity, notably chemical products, pesticides, and fertilizers, the drilling of wells, and the extraction of mineral substances.

In case of necessity, the competent authority shall delimit, in addition to the immediate and close protection perimeters, a distant protection perimeter within which the deposits, installations, and activities mentioned in the preceding paragraph are regulated in order to prevent the dangers of pollution they present for the withdrawn waters.

Article 50: The competent authority shall delimit protection areas around dam reservoirs, lakes, ponds and, generally, bodies of water intended, at least partially, for consumption. These areas may also be established to protect groundwater recharge zones or zones of particular ecological interest.

In addition to the prohibitions and rules enacted in Article 49 above, the act of delimitation may also regulate activities such as watering, penning, and circulation of animals, and the erection of buildings or structures for residential or other use.

Article 51: Decrees in the council of ministers shall determine the modalities of application of the provisions of Articles 47 to 50 of this law and in particular the procedures for the delimitation of areas and perimeters of close and distant protection, including when they concern withdrawal wells existing at the promulgation of this law, as well as the conditions under which the owners or occupants of concerned lands may be compensated in the case where they suffer, as a result, a direct, material, and certain prejudice.

SECTION II
PROTECTION OF THE NATURAL AND CULTURAL AQUATIC HERITAGE

Article 52: In national parks and other areas benefiting from special protection, as well as in wetlands and particularly those of international importance inscribed on the list provided for by the Ramsar Convention of 2 February 1971, actions likely to undermine the balance of ecosystems or affect their biological diversity are regulated and, where appropriate, prohibited. Specifically targeted are uses of water leading to a modification of their regime, the spreading for any purpose whatsoever of chemical products and in particular agricultural pesticides, and the discharge of effluents or toxic substances, the discharge or flow of wastewater, and the deposit of refuse or domestic or industrial waste.

The regulation or prohibition may, as needed, apply to actions carried out or envisaged outside the protected area or the wetland.

Article 53: Wetlands of international importance inscribed on the list provided for by the Ramsar Convention of 2 February 1971 are provided with a management plan.

Article 54: Works built in the bed of watercourses must maintain a minimum flow guaranteeing the satisfaction of the needs of users and aquatic life downstream of the work. When they are located in watercourses frequented by migratory fish, they must also be equipped with passage facilities.

Article 55: In lagoon environments and transitional waters, protection zones may be delimited according to a procedure defined by decree in the council of ministers, on the proposal of the minister.

Within these zones, activities are subject to the provisions of Articles 52 and 53 of this law, as well as to specific rules aimed at the protection of aquatic species, including coastal fishery resources.

The decree mentioned in the first paragraph of this article shall also specify the applicable regime in the protection zones.

Article 56: Sites, natural environments, and landscapes presenting, from an aesthetic and cultural point of view, a particular interest linked to the presence of water may be the subject of special protection based notably on the regulation and, where appropriate, the prohibition of activities and installations likely to harm them.

The above protection measures result from regulatory acts. They are also applicable to aquatic or subaquatic spaces presenting an archaeological interest.

SECTION III
SPECIFIC PROTECTION REGIMES

Article 57: A decree in the council of ministers shall determine the conditions under which regulations for agricultural and pastoral activities may be enacted. This regulation includes, where appropriate, restrictions on the movement of animals, or even the prohibition of agricultural and pastoral practices and techniques likely to have a negative impact on the hydrological cycle or the quality of water.

Article 58: Land use planning instruments and urban planning rules shall take into consideration the requirements of sustainable water management.

The modalities for determining zones within which the erection of buildings or structures, for residential use or not, is prohibited or subordinated to the observance of special prescriptions are defined by regulation.

CHAPTER X
PUBLIC INTERVENTIONS RELATING TO WATER

Article 59: In order to ensure the exercise of the right to water recognized in Article 6 of this law, the State and the decentralized territorial authorities are responsible, within the framework of their respective competencies, for the organization and operation of the public drinking water supply service.

The service is managed, either directly or under a management contract, or by way of concession or lease. Different management and distribution modalities may be adopted in urban and rural areas.

Article 60: Water delivered for consumption by populations must be potable.

Whatever the management mode of the public drinking water supply service, the competent public entity shall ensure, under the authority of the ministers in charge respectively of water and health, and in accordance with the provisions of the public hygiene code, the quality of the distributed water and compliance with standards.

The control of water quality is carried out by laboratories accredited by the State. This control is mandatory.

A decree in the council of ministers shall fix the conditions and modalities for obtaining the accreditation.

Article 61: The State, the decentralized territorial authorities and, where applicable, the person in charge of managing the public drinking water supply service, are required to provide users with appropriate information concerning the quality and price of the distributed water.

Article 62: The treatment and evacuation of wastewater are elements of the right to water. The public entity in charge of it shall ensure its management according to the modalities mentioned in Article 60 of this law.

Article 63: Development projects as well as urban planning documents and plans must take into account the drainage and evacuation of rainwater, which are elements of the right to safety and a healthy environment.

The design, execution, and operation of works and buildings, for residential use or not, installed in flow zones or flood-prone zones, must respect the free flow of water.

The public entity in charge of the drainage and evacuation of rainwater shall ensure its management according to the modalities mentioned in Article 60 of this law.

Article 64: In order to ensure the sustainable management of a body of surface or groundwater, the State may conclude with the concerned territorial authorities and other public or private persons, as the case may be, a river contract, a lake or lagoon contract, or an aquifer contract.

The contract shall establish, in compliance with the provisions of the master plan for water development and management, a program of works and actions to be carried out in order to achieve the objectives it determines. It shall also define the respective contributions of the different partners to the financing of the program.

Article 65: When a severe drought or flood or other exceptional circumstances do not allow for the satisfaction of all water needs, the minister holds a power of control and allocation implemented according to the modalities defined by decree in the council of ministers.

The prefect has, by delegation, the same powers and in the same circumstances. In these situations, private water points may be made available to the public for a just and prior compensation of the owners or their successors, from public funds.

In all cases where control and allocation measures are taken, the satisfaction of water needs corresponding to the supply of populations is considered a priority.

Article 66: The State exercises a general mission of coordination and control for the purposes of prevention, alert, and flood control. It is incumbent upon it, in this capacity, to guarantee that the measures taken in this domain by any authority whatsoever, respect the principles and objectives of sustainable water management.

The minister, in conjunction with the ministers in charge of urban planning, the environment, and civil security, shall ensure that the rules and decisions on land use comply with the above-mentioned requirements and allow, in case of flood, to reduce as much as possible the damage caused to persons and property.

Article 67: Given their importance in the hydrological cycle and in the sustainability of the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that depend on them, wetlands must be conserved in order to fully play their natural roles of renewing the water resource and maintaining its quality.

When considerations of general interest lead to modifying the allocation of a wetland or an aquatic environment, particularly for agricultural or industrial purposes, or with a view to carrying out an urbanization operation, the authorization procedure necessarily implies a declaration of public utility of the operation and an environmental impact study.

The authorization is accompanied by prescriptions, in particular measures intended to reduce or compensate for the negative impacts of this operation.
