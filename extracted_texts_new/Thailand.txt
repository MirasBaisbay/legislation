Given on the 25th Day of December B.E. 2561; 
Being the 3rd Year of the Present Reign. 
 
 
 
His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun is graciously 
pleased to proclaim that: 
 
 
Whereas it is expedient to have the law on water resources; 
 
 
Whereas this Act contains certain provisions in relation to the restriction of rights and

40, section 42 and section 43 (2) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand so permits by virtue 
of provisions of law; 
 
 
Whereas the reasons and need for the restriction of rights and liberties of

provision of public utility services and other public interests and, in this regard, the enactment

CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC WATER RESOURCES  
______________ 
 
 
Section 73.  In the case where the N.W.R.C. considers that any area is, by nature, 
a river source or a wetland which deserves preservation in the interest of the conservation of 
public water resources, the N.W.R.C. shall entrust the Minister of Natural Resources and

area under the law on the promotion and conservation of national environmental quality. 
 
 
Section 74.  The Minister of Interior, with the approval of the N.W.R.C., has the 
power to issue a Ministerial Regulation prescribing rules on the exploitation of land likely to

appointed by the Minister of Interior shall have the power to give an order in writing demanding 
the owner or possessor of the land to rectify, vary or discontinue the exploitation of land in 
accordance with the rules, procedures and conditions and within the period of time prescribed 
by the competent official, provided that if compliance with such order causes the owner or 
possessor of such land to be deprived of the use of the land or suffer damage, such person 
shall be entitled to the recompense or compensation for the damage, as the case may be. In 
this instance, in the case where the owner or possessor of the land fails to comply with the

possessor of the land is not entitled to compensation for damage but remains entitled to the 
recompense for the deprivation of the use of land.
