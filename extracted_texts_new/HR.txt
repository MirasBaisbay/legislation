Water management consists of all activities, measures, and actions which, on the basis of this Act and the act regulating the financing of water management, are undertaken by the Republic of Croatia, Croatian Waters, and units of local and regional (county) self-government to achieve the objectives from Article 4 of this Act, except for activities, measures, and actions in the domains of detailed land reclamation drainage, public irrigation, and water services.
The objectives of water management are:
to ensure sufficient quantities of quality drinking water for the public water supply,
to ensure the necessary quantities of water of appropriate quality for various economic and personal needs,
to protect people and their property from floods and other forms of detrimental effects of water, and
to achieve and preserve a good status of waters for the protection of the life and health of people, the protection of their property, and the protection of aquatic and water-dependent ecosystems.
Principles of Water Management
Article 5
Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which must be protected, defended, and treated as such, wisely and rationally.
Waters shall be managed according to the principle of the unity of the water system and the principle of sustainable development, by which the needs of the present generation are met without compromising the right and ability of future generations to meet their own.
Water management shall be adapted to global climate change.
For the use of water that exceeds the limits of general use, as well as for any deterioration of the status of waters, a fee shall be paid in proportion to the benefit, or the degree and extent of the impact on the change in the status of water bodies, respecting the economic valuation of water, the recovery of costs of its use, and the protection of the water environment and other components of the environment.
The protection and use of water shall be based on the precautionary principle, the taking of preventive measures, the rectification of damage caused to the water environment at its source, and the principles of "polluter pays" and "user pays".
When implementing activities for the conservation, protection, and use of waters, the competent bodies or competent legal persons, in accordance with the Act, shall make decisions as close as possible to the place where the water is exposed to an impact or where it is used.
Flood risk management is based on the principles of solidarity, priority of needs, emergency services, permanent immobilization and mobilization; it is planned and coordinated at the level of the river basin district with the aim of reducing the risk of adverse consequences of floods, especially for the life, health, and property of people, the environment, cultural heritage, economic activities, and infrastructure.
In the adoption of planning documents, in accordance with this Act and special regulations on environmental protection, public information and participation shall be ensured.
The management of waters that have a transboundary impact shall be achieved through cooperation with other states, by concluding and implementing international agreements, by providing information on transboundary impacts on waters and the water environment, on major accidents as defined by regulations on environmental protection, and through the international exchange of information on waters and the water environment.
Water Policy
Article 6
The Ministry is the holder of water policy.
Other state administration bodies, legal persons with public authorities, and other legal and natural persons, as well as other public and advisory bodies, which by their activities significantly contribute to the achievement of water policy objectives, shall also participate in the preparation and implementation of water policy.
The Ministry shall achieve international cooperation on matters regulated by this Act.
