WATER LAW

**TITLE I**
**GENERAL PROVISIONS**

**Purpose**
**Article 1**
The purpose of this Law is to establish the provisions that govern the integrated management of water as an indispensable element for life, human well-being, and the sustainable development of the country, and is of a strategic nature and a matter of State interest.

**Definitions**
**Article 2**
For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply:

**Aquifer:** A reservoir consisting of porous and permeable materials from which groundwater can be extracted.

**Groundwater:** Water that infiltrates and penetrates the soil and subsoil, saturating the pores or fissures of rocks, and which may eventually accumulate on top of impermeable layers, forming an underground reservoir.

**Surface Waters:** Natural and artificial bodies of water, including the channels of continuous and intermittent natural streams, as well as the beds of lakes, lagoons, and reservoirs.

**Quality of a Water Body:** The physical, chemical, and biological characterization of natural waters to determine their composition and usefulness for men and women and other living beings.

**Hydrological Cycle:** The circulation of water masses in different, interconvertible physical states, which occurs between the environment and living beings, driven by the force of gravity and solar energy.

**Water Pollution:** The action and effect of introducing materials or forms of energy or inducing conditions in water that, directly or indirectly, imply a detrimental alteration of its quality in relation to its subsequent uses or its ecological function. For the purposes of this Law, the concept of water degradation includes detrimental alterations to its surrounding environment.

**Hydrogeological Basin:** A geographical area in which the groundwater present, by virtue of the dominant geological characteristics, drains and discharges at a common site, which may be a river, lake, or sea, and is delimited by a water divide.

**Hydrographic Basin:** A territorial unit delimited by the divides of surface waters that converge towards the same channel, forming spaces in which complex interactions and interdependencies develop between biotic and abiotic, social, economic, and cultural components, through the flow of inputs, information, and products.

**Transboundary Hydrographic Basins:** A geographical area that extends across the territory of two or more countries, demarcated by the dividing line of a hydrological system of surface and groundwater flowing towards a common outlet. This category includes those basins that Venezuela shares or that are common with Colombia, Brazil, and Guyana.

**Mass Discharges:** The volume of polluting liquid effluents that are introduced into a body of water. Such volumes may be referenced according to the polluting source and the type of pollutant in question.

**Return Period of River Floods:** The time interval necessary for a flood of equal characteristic in volume or magnitude to be repeated.

**Hydrogeological Provinces:** Regions with similar general characteristics regarding the occurrence of groundwater, taking into account, among other factors, geological formation and physiographic characteristics for their definition. This spatial unit comprises several contiguous hydrogeological basins.

**Hydrographic Region:** A spatial unit corresponding to a very extensive territory that integrates several contiguous hydrographic basins.

**Subsidence:** The sinking or settling of the ground due to the extraction of hydrocarbons or water from the subsoil or due to mining activities.

**Water Transfers:** An operation by which part of the water resources are transferred from one basin to another, which are not necessarily contiguous, for the purposes of agricultural, industrial, or hydroelectric use, or for supplying populations.

**Institutional User:** A legal entity representing the Public Power that utilizes surface or groundwater sources for water supply or electricity generation purposes.

**Liquid Discharge:** Any discharge of water made directly or indirectly into water bodies through channels, drains, or drainage systems; direct discharge onto the soil or injection into the subsoil; discharge into sewer networks; discharge into the coastal marine environment; and submarine discharges.

**Article 3**
**Integrated Water Management**
Integrated water management comprises, among others, the set of technical, scientific, economic, financial, institutional, managerial, legal, and operational activities aimed at the conservation and use of water for the collective benefit, considering water in all its forms and the associated natural ecosystems, the hydrographic basins that contain them, the actors and interests of the users, the different territorial levels of government, and the environmental, territorial planning, and socioeconomic development policies of the country.

9. To guarantee national sovereignty and security, the use of water from any of its sources may not be granted at any time or place to foreign companies that do not have legal domicile in the country.
10. Water, being goods in the public domain, may not form part of the private domain of any natural person or legal entity.
11. The conservation of water, in any of its sources and physical states, shall prevail over any other interest of an economic or social nature.
12. Water, being part of the natural heritage and sovereignty of peoples, represents an instrument for peace among nations.
