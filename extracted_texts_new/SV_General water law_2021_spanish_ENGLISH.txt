SALVADORAN WATER AUTHORITY
General Water Resources Law

DECREE NO. 253

THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR,

CONSIDERING:

I. That Article 1 of the Constitution of the Republic establishes that the human person is the origin and the end of all State activity, which is organized to achieve justice, legal certainty, and the common good; likewise, it is the obligation of the State to ensure for the inhabitants of the Republic the enjoyment of liberty, health, culture, economic well-being, and social justice.

II. That the right to health and life is intrinsically related to having guaranteed access to drinking water and sanitation, for which reason the State must recognize the human right to water and sanitation, wherein all persons may have clean, sufficient, safe, acceptable, accessible, and affordable water, in terms of quantity, quality, continuity, and coverage.

III. That in accordance with Art. 117 of the Constitution of the Republic, it is the duty of the State to protect natural resources, as well as the diversity and integrity of the environment, to guarantee sustainable development and declares the protection, conservation, rational use, recovery, or replacement of natural resources to be of social interest.

IV. That El Salvador has ratified international treaties in which it directly or indirectly acquires responsibility for the integrated management of water; likewise, and within the international framework, important principles have been established for the sustainable management of water, such as the Principles contained in the Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development; the Berlin Rules on Water Resources; and more recently, the recognition of the Human Right to Water and the Human Right to Sanitation by the United Nations General Assembly.

V. That water must be constituted as a national public good, inalienable, unseizable, and imprescriptible, for which reason its dominion, use, and enjoyment belong to all the inhabitants of the country; consequently, one of the main purposes that the State must pursue is the issuance of a regulation that allows for ensuring the integrated management of water, its sustainability, and the water security of the present and future population; which directly impacts the improvement of the quality of life of all inhabitants and the promotion of the country's economic and social development.

VI. That there are norms or articles scattered in different legal bodies that regulate the protection, conservation, and sectoral use of water; however, it is necessary to have a dedicated institutional framework for the issue of water resources that specifically regulates and orders its use and utilization, and establishes the legal framework for its administration and sustainable management.

VII. That increasing climate variability is already generating growing irregularity in rainfall patterns and excess precipitation that cause great damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and the population, as well as severe deficits at different times of the year that put the human water supply and food security at risk due to its lack or scarcity.

VIII. That women play a fundamental role in the supply, management, and protection of water, for which reason the recognition of this reality demands effective policies that address their needs and interests and that strengthen their capacities to participate at all levels in policies and programs on the use and management of water resources.

IX. That for all the considerations previously stated, it is imperative to have a regulation that establishes the institutional framework, provisions, procedures, and instruments to order and regulate the integrated management of the country's water resources.

THEREFORE,

in exercise of its constitutional powers and at the initiative of the President of the Republic, through the Ministers of Environment and Natural Resources and of Public Works and Transportation,

**USES OF THE WATER RESOURCE**

**SECTION ONE**
**COMMON PROVISIONS**

**General criteria for use**
**Art. 62.-** All use of the water resource shall be made in accordance with the priority uses established in this Law, which constitute the way to establish preferences for the use and utilization of the water resource in order to manage supply and demand for its sustainability.

**Priority order for the use and utilization of the water resource.**
**Art. 63.-** ASA must guarantee the use and utilization related to the water resource according to the following priority order:
a) Water for human consumption and domestic use.
b) Use for ecosystem sustainability.
c) Agricultural use, seeking food security.
d) Use for the generation of electric power.
e) Industrial and commercial use.
f) Recreational uses.
g) Other uses.

The waters used and necessary for human consumption and domestic use have priority, and their use cannot be subordinated or conditioned to any other use; their only restriction shall be given by the environmental flow regime defined for the water source.

The priority uses establish a hierarchy and are not mutually exclusive, except in case of conflicts between different uses or due to availability, in which case the immediately superior use shall acquire preeminence.

**Right and obligations for domestic use**
**Art. 64.-** Every person may make common use of the surface waters of rivers, lakes, and lagoons, and of underground waters for domestic purposes; these uses shall be carried out in a way that does not cause deterioration of the quality and flow of the waters, nor damage to third parties, and without waste or misuse of the same, complying with the environmental and health norms in this regard.

Domestic use shall not require authorization, nor shall it be subject to the collection of a fee for use and utilization by ASA.

**Environmental Flow and Ecosystems**
**Art. 65.-** For every authorization, ASA must determine the environmental flow regime that allows for the proper development of the biological cycles of species associated with the aquatic environment, conserving the sustainability of water ecosystems, and satisfying the needs of the population.

**Utilization of rainwater**
**Art. 66.-** The State shall promote the utilization and harvesting of rainwater, for which it must promote incentive programs, national and international cooperation, both financial and technical.
ASA shall issue the guidelines or directives for the utilization and harvesting of rainwater.
Every natural person may use the rainwater that precipitates on their property, provided that it is not for commercial purposes, does not cause prejudice to third parties, nor significantly affects other water sources.

**Transfers**
**Art. 67.-** ASA may authorize the transfers of surface or underground waters from one basin to another, only in exceptional cases, when:
a) In the demanding basin, there is no other alternative that guarantees the environmental flow regime.
b) It is essential to guarantee the water supply for human, domestic, non-commercial, or non-profit consumption to already established populations.
c) To guarantee food security.

**Art. 105.-** ASA will be empowered to determine and authorize the fees for water use and utilization, for discharges, and for the use of the goods that are part of the public water domain, as well as for the administrative, technical, and scientific services provided to third parties, whether public or private, that it sells or provides.

The income from these items will be used to cover the administrative expenses of ASA and those related to the integrated management of water resources.

**Establishment of fees**
**Art. 106.-** The fee is established as a payment in legal tender, and is applicable in the following cases:
a) For the use and utilization of national waters, whether consumptive or non-consumptive;
b) For the discharge of wastewater into receiving media that are part of the public water domain; and
c) For the use of goods established in the public water domain.

The taxable base for the calculation of fees will be published in the Official Gazette for the purpose of its validity; the taxable base of said fees may be modified according to new environmental conditions and the availability of the water resource.

The payment of the fee must be made by every natural or legal person, public or private, authorized with an allocation, authorization, or permit; or who, according to this law, must obtain said authorization from ASA.

**Payment for administrative, technical, or scientific services of ASA**
**Art. 107.-** All natural or legal persons, public or private, who must, may, or are authorized in accordance with this law and who wish any type of administrative, technical, or scientific service provided by ASA, will be obliged to the corresponding payment by reason of this law.

ASA will issue the rates for the administrative, technical, or scientific services it provides.

**Purpose of the fee for use and utilization of the water resource**
**Art. 108.-** The purpose of the fee for the use and utilization of national waters is to contribute to regulating the integrated management of water and to provide the necessary financial resources to carry out activities related to said management.

**Collection of fee for use or utilization of the water resource**
**Art. 109.-** All natural or legal persons, public or private, who use the water resource for purposes other than domestic use in accordance with this law will be subject to the payment of the fee.
In the case of water supply networks, ASA will apply the collection of this fee to the entities that provide said service.

**Determination of the fee for use and utilization of the water resource.**
**Art. 110.-** The fee for use and utilization will be established based on the volume of water used in a specific period of time. This period of time will be expressed in hours per day, days per month, or months per year.

The formula for the establishment of the fee for use and utilization of the water resource will be the following:

CFU = VU x BP x C1 x C2 x C3 x C4 x C5

Where:
CFU = Fee for use and utilization of water in dollars ($)
VU = Volume of water used, expressed in cubic meters (m³)
BP = Base price, expressed in dollars/m³ ($0.03-$0.2)
C1 = Coefficient based on the type of use and utilization in accordance with this Law (dimensionless)
C2 = Coefficient based on the origin of the waters at the intake point (dimensionless)
C3 = Coefficient for socio-environmental conditions of the Hydrological Analysis Unit (HAU) (dimensionless)
C4 = Coefficient based on the social interest or purpose of the use or utilization of the water resource (dimensionless)
C5 = Coefficient related to the consumptive or non-consumptive use condition of the water resource (dimensionless).

The base price (BP) may be updated according to the consumer price index or any other value of socioeconomic relevance to the country established by the Central Reserve Bank.

ASA will establish in the regulations of this law the values of the coefficients established in this article for the determination of the payment as a fee for use and utilization.

**Discharge fee**
**Art. 111.-** All natural or legal persons, public or private, who use water bodies to introduce, transport, or eliminate discharges that may cause modifications in the physical, chemical, or biological quality of the water will be subject to the payment of the discharge fee.

The circumstances in which a discharge-generating entity must be to be subject to the payment of the discharge fee are the following:
a) That there is a point source discharge.
b) That the discharge is made to a receiving body.
c) That the net discharged pollutant load in any of the parameters subject to the collection of the fee results in positive values.

Excluded from the payment of the discharge fee are all those generating entities that do not comply with the three previous requirements; as well as those whose domestic use wastewater is discharged into a septic tank with a drain for infiltration into the subsoil. Single-family homes that are under the situation described in this article will be excluded from the process of obtaining a discharge permit and therefore are exempt from the payment of this type of fee.

In the case of sanitary sewer networks, ASA will apply the collection of this fee to the entities that provide said service and not to those who discharge into them.

**Purpose of the discharge fee**
**Art. 112.-** The purpose of the discharge fee is to contribute to regulating the conditions, characteristics, and quality, as well as improving the conditions in the receiving media that are part of the public water domain, reducing risks to the environment and especially those related to people's health, ensuring its subsequent utilization by other uses and users, and incentivizing behavior patterns that contribute to reducing pollution.

The payment of the discharge fee will be made through payment in legal tender, based on the cost of removing polluting elements using the best available technology. This type of fee will provide financial resources to ASA for the execution of actions that allow for preventing, controlling, and reversing pollution and maintaining the adequate level of quality of water resources.

**Determination of the discharge fee**
**Art. 113.-** The total value expressed in dollars as a discharge fee will correspond to the sum of the values calculated for the individual fee for each parameter subject to collection according to the following expression:

DFC = Σn=1 FeePj

Where:
DFC = Discharge fee, expressed in dollars ($)
FeePj = Fee for each parameter used, expressed in dollars ($)
n = number of parameters to be used.

The calculation of the value for each parameter will be based on the relationship between the discharged concentration of said parameter and the maximum permitted concentration of it.

The scenarios and formulas to determine the fee for each parameter j will be the following:
a) When the discharged concentration of parameter j (Cvj) is less than or equal to the maximum permitted concentration for said parameter (Cpj), the following formula will be used:

FeePj = Q x DaF x t x Cnj x BPj x M x A x K1 x C3 x C5

Where:
FeePj = Fee for each parameter j used, expressed in dollars ($)
Q = Average discharged flow rate expressed in liters per second (l/s)
DaF = Dimensional adjustment factor based on the units of measurement of parameter j.
t = Average discharge time per day of the user, expressed in hours.
Cnj = Discharged concentration minus concentration at the intake point, of parameter j, in the measurement units established in the corresponding technical regulation.
BPj = Base price corresponding to parameter j, expressed in dollars per unit of measurement of said parameter ($/unit of measurement).
M = Monthly discharge period of the user, expressed in days.
A = Annual discharge period of the user, expressed in months.
K1 = Regulatory compliance coefficient (0.5-4) (dimensionless)
C3 = Coefficient for socio-environmental conditions of the Hydrological Analysis Unit (HAU) (dimensionless)
C5 = Coefficient related to the consumptive or non-consumptive use condition of the water resource (dimensionless).

a) When the discharged concentration of parameter j (Cvj) is greater than the maximum permitted concentration for said parameter (Cpj), the following formula will be used:

FeePj = Q x DaF x t x BPj x M x A x [(Cpj – Ca¡) + (Cvj − Cpj) x K1] x C3 x C5

Where:
FeePj = Fee for each parameter j used, expressed in dollars ($)
Q = Average discharged flow rate expressed in liters per second (l/s)
DaF = Dimensional adjustment factor based on the units of measurement of parameter j.
t = Average discharge time per day of the user, expressed in hours.
BPj = Base price corresponding to parameter j, expressed in dollars per unit of measurement of said parameter ($/unit of measurement).
M = Monthly discharge period of the user, expressed in days.
A = Annual discharge period of the user, expressed in months.
Cpj = Maximum permitted concentration of parameter j, as established in the corresponding technical regulation and in the measurement units established in said regulation.
Caj = Present concentration of parameter j at the intake point, in the measurement units established in the corresponding technical regulation.
Cnj = Discharged concentration minus concentration at the intake point, of parameter j, in the measurement units established in the corresponding technical regulation.
Cvj = Discharged concentration of parameter j, in the measurement units established in the corresponding technical regulation.
K1 = Regulatory compliance coefficient (0.5-4) (dimensionless)
C3 = Coefficient for socio-environmental conditions of the Hydrological Analysis Unit (HAU) (dimensionless)
C5 = Coefficient related to the consumptive or non-consumptive use condition of the water resource (dimensionless).

For the purposes of all the previous formulas, the maximum permitted concentration or permissible limits of each parameter will be those established in the corresponding technical regulations.

ASA will establish in the regulations of this law the values of the coefficients established in this article for the determination of the payment as a discharge fee.

**Obligation to submit information to ASA**
**Art. 114.-** All natural or legal persons, public or private, subject to the payment of fees in accordance with the provisions of this Law, must submit to ASA the information required of them in accordance with the stipulations of the corresponding authorization.

**Presumptive pollutant load**
**Art. 115.-** In the event that natural or legal persons, public and private, subject to the payment of the discharge fee, do not provide the information required by ASA regarding concentrations, flow rates, and discharge times, said institution will establish it based on technically adequate analyses and studies or by comparison with similar activities in the corresponding Hydrographic Zone, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding sanctions.

The costs resulting from obtaining the requested information and studies will be borne by the responsible user, with their reimbursement being made effective according to the procedure established in the regulations of this Law. In case of non-compliance, the certification issued by ASA will be enforceable.

**Fee for the use of goods that are part of the public water domain**
**Art. 116.-** The fee for the use of goods that are part of the public water domain will be developed in the regulations of this Law, based on the ecosystem value that said goods provide, which must be calculated by ASA.

**Fee update**
**Art. 117.-** The values of the coefficients and the base price for the calculation and determination of the fee will be published by ASA and must be updated within a maximum period of three years. As long as new values for the coefficients and the base price have not been approved, the last approved ones will be applied transitionally.
