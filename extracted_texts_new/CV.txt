2010 I SERIES — No. 63 “B. O.” OF THE REPUBLIC OF CABO VERDE — 19 OCTOBER 2015

COUNCIL OF MINISTERS

Legislative Decree No. 3/2015

of 19 October

The Constitution of the Republic imposes upon the State, as fundamental tasks, the guarantee of respect for human rights and the full enjoyment of fundamental rights for all citizens; the promotion of the well-being and quality of life of the Cape Verdean people, especially the most deprived, and the progressive removal of obstacles that impede real equality of opportunity among all citizens, especially factors of discrimination against women in society; the progressive creation of the necessary conditions for the transformation and modernization of economic and social structures in order to make the economic and social rights of citizens effective; as well as the protection of the landscape, natural resources, and the environment, considering water as a unique resource, which belongs to the people, that is, in legal terms, to the public domain of the State, being inalienable, imprescriptible, and unattachable.

The Human Rights Council of the United Nations, through Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14 of 30 September 2010, declared water and sanitation as a fundamental human right, affirming that "the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and is inseparably linked to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human dignity."

Previously, however, the international community, through the Resolution of the United Nations General Assembly of 28 July 2010, had already recognized water and sanitation as a human right essential for the full enjoyment of life and all other human rights, having urged States and international organizations to ensure financial resources, training, and transfer of necessary technologies, with a view to improving universal access to these goods, from which millions of human beings are excluded globally.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 emphasizes equality and the right to life and reaffirms that every human being has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of themselves and their family.

General or common international law is an integral part of the Cape Verdean legal order, and the legal acts issued by the competent bodies of the supranational organizations of which Cabo Verde is a part are directly in force in the internal legal order, under the terms and for the purposes of Article 12 of the Constitution.

In these terms, the right of access of the Cape Verdean people to electricity, water, and sanitation, as a human right derived from other human rights, with the same dignity as the right to health, well-being, and quality of life, constitutes a fundamental task of the State, guaranteed by the Constitution and by the international legal order directly in force in the internal order.

The issue of sustainable water management is one of the greatest challenges for Cabo Verde and has been a permanent concern of successive governments, as well as public and private institutions and society in general.

Cabo Verde is a country located in the Sahel zone, characterized by its extreme aridity. Precipitation is limited to an average of 230mm per year, and yet only 13% of this precipitation contributes to the replenishment of groundwater, which, incidentally, has been decreasing year after year. Consequently, the Cape Verdean nation is increasingly dependent on desalinated water for consumption. The high cost of energy and the fact that about 80% of the water for domestic consumption in Cabo Verde is desalinated configure water as an extremely challenging, delicate, and urgent problem to solve.

Notwithstanding these challenges, the country has made significant progress in promoting the population's access to safe drinking water, having already achieved in 2007 the millennium development goals in this matter, planned for 2015.

According to the 2010 National Census, more than 92% of Cape Verdeans have access to drinking water. However, the successes achieved cannot conceal the enormous challenges that the Nation, as a whole, continues to face. There are still great differences in access between cities and the countryside, the cost tends to be increasingly high, management inefficiencies, the frequency of cuts, and the quality and quantity of supply still leave much to be desired, with particular incidence on the vulnerable populations of the countryside and the peripheries of cities.

Indeed, all official macro-documents diagnosing the sector show that access to water and sanitation affects mainly peri-urban and rural populations, and in particular women heads of household, reproducing poverty and gender inequality, as well as children who are prejudiced, not only in their health, but also in their school performance, by losing immense time carrying water from fountains or public standpipes, time they could dedicate to school and study.

The Government Program for the VIII Legislature 2011-2016 declares that a key element of the Government's action to broaden the population's access to basic services is the reform of the institutional and legal framework, recognizing that there are currently too many overlaps and no clear institutional responsibilities. There are too many actors without a leader, coordinator, or common manager. Major reforms to integrate the sector under a single organization will be implemented to facilitate the natural link between water and wastewater (sanitation), to ensure that there will be a leading institution for the water and wastewater sector, to promote efficiency, reduce duplication, and ensure strong management of these sectors. The objective will be the creation of a single institution to control the water and sanitation sector, while the regulation of prices and efficiency will be carried out by the economic regulatory entity and environmental regulation will be the responsibility of the department for the environment.

For the materialization of its Program, the Government assumes as one of the primary objectives of its mandate the reform of the Water and Sanitation sectors with the main objective of:

Increasing access to drinking water and basic sanitation;

Facilitating the planning and integrated management of water resources and basic sanitation;

Implementing effective technical and economic regulation;

Ensuring the financial sustainability of the system with an emphasis on cost recovery;

Attracting the private sector; and

Ensuring the sustainability and institutional autonomy of the sector.

In this context, the Government negotiated with the United States of America the second Millennium Challenge Account Compact (MCA-II) aiming to contribute globally to the reduction of poverty through the reduction of costs to the economy of Cabo Verde from the inefficient provision of certain public services and the removal of institutional conditions that impede private sector investments.

Integrated into MCA-II is the WASH Project (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Project), with the specific objective of improving water supply and sanitation services for Cape Verdean families and companies, through the following actions:

Reform of the institutions for implementing national policy and sector regulation;

Transformation of water and sanitation service providers into autonomous entities operating on a commercial basis;

Improvement of the quality and increase of the coverage area of water and sanitation infrastructures.

The revision of the legal and institutional framework of the water and sanitation sector is part of the first action and aims at the following objectives:

Revision and updating of the previously drafted national legislation bills, to reflect the proposals of the ongoing institutional reform;

Identification of norms, standards, codes, and other legislation related to the regulation of the water and sanitation sector that require revision or drafting, to be subsequently prepared in accordance with the best international practices;

Updating of the national legislation bills, in order to remedy the identified problems.

It is within this scope that the present Water and Sanitation Code is inscribed, which was based on the political, institutional, and legal framework of the water and sanitation sector in force in Cabo Verde, and was preceded by the elaboration of a Gap analysis with the identification of the main gaps, overlaps, and contradictions, bearing in mind the current and future needs of the sector and the best international practices in this domain, as well as the involvement and collection of opinions and pareceres of the main stakeholders of the sector, in the different phases of its elaboration.

The new Water and Sanitation Code (CAS) aims to create a disciplinary legal regime for the sector that is coherent and clear, easy to consult and apply, complemented by an institutional framework with a complete separation of functions with the recent creation of the National Water and Sanitation Agency (ANAS) and the National Water and Sanitation Council (CNAS), through Law No. 46/VIII/2013, of 17 September, and Law No. 45/VIII/2013, of 17 September, respectively, followed by the corporatization of the sector.

In these terms,

Under the legislative authorization granted by Law No. 96/VIII/2015, of 29 July;

Using the faculty conferred by paragraph b) of No. 2 of Article 204 of the Constitution, the Government decrees the following:

TITLE III

OWNERSHIP OF WATER RESOURCES

CHAPTER I

General Provisions

Article 50

Principle of Public Domain

All water resources belong to the public domain of the State.

Also belonging to the public domain of the State are hydraulic works and sanitation infrastructures carried out by public law legal persons, those intended for public use or for public utility purposes, and likewise the hydraulic works, sanitation infrastructures, installations, and other immovable property assigned to concessions for the management of water resources.

Article 51

Principle of Disassociation of Rights over Water Resources

The right of property or another right over land does not confer any real right over the water resources existing therein.

Article 52

Public Domain Regime

Water resources, hydraulic works, sanitation infrastructures, and other assets of the public water domain may not be the subject of rights in favor of third parties, except in the ways and within the limits established by the laws that directly concern them.

In particular, water resources, hydraulic works, sanitation infrastructures, and other assets of the public water domain are inalienable, imprescriptible, unattachable, and unsusceptible of being encumbered by the modes of private law.

Water resources, hydraulic works, sanitation infrastructures, and other assets of the public water domain may be the subject of domanial transfers and assignment to specific uses, under the terms of the law.

Article 53

Private Hydraulic Works

Private hydraulic works and sanitation infrastructures of particular interest intended for the singular or collective private use of the water domain and carried out by private entities on their own land or on the land of others with the authorization of the owner or equivalent are of private property, even if their respective costs are co-financed or subsidized by public law legal persons.

CHAPTER II

Regime of Lands in the Public Water Domain

Article 54

Scope of Application

The beds of watercourses and lakes, as well as their respective banks and adjacent zones, are subject to the provisions of this Code in all matters not regulated by special laws.

Article 55

Concept of Bed

The bed is understood as the land covered by the waters, when not influenced by extraordinary floods, including the alluvial islands, sandbars, and shoals formed by alluvial deposition.

The bed is limited by the line corresponding to the edge of the lands that the waters cover in conditions of average floods, without overflowing onto the natural, usually dry, soil.

Article 56

Concept of Bank

A bank is understood as a strip of land contiguous or overhanging the line that limits the bed of the waters.

The bank has a width of 10 m (ten meters) and is counted from the limit line of the bed, unless this line reaches steep cliffs, in which case the width of the bank is counted from the crest of the cliff.

If the bank reaches a road, its width only extends to that road.

Article 57

Concept of Adjacent Zone

An adjacent zone is understood as the entire area contiguous to the bank that is classified as such by a regulatory decree, because it is threatened by floods.

The adjacent zones extend from the limit of the bank to a conventional line defined, for each case, in the classification decree, under the terms and for the purposes of this Code.

If the limit line of the bed reaches a road, the adjacent zone extends from the limit of the bed to the conventional line defined under the terms of the preceding number.

Article 58

Legal Status of Beds, Banks, and Adjacent Zones

The beds and, likewise, the banks that occupy public lands are considered to be in the public domain of the State.

Banks that occupy private lands are considered to be the object of private property, subject to administrative easements.

Adjacent zones are considered to be the object of private property, subject to public utility restrictions.

Lands traditionally occupied next to the crest of steep cliffs may constitute private property.

Beds that are abandoned by the waters, or are gained from them, do not accrue to the private parcels of the bank that may be contiguous to them, continuing to be integrated into the public domain if they do not exceed the widths fixed in Article 56, and automatically entering the private domain of the State in the contrary case.

When there are private parcels contiguous to beds, the portions of land eroded slowly and successively by the waters are considered automatically integrated into the public domain, without this giving rise to any compensation.

If the private parcels contiguous to beds are invaded by the waters that remain on them without causing erosion of the lands, the respective owners retain their right of property, but the State may expropriate these parcels.

Article 59

Constitution of Public Property over Private Parcels of Banks

In the case of alienation, voluntary or forced, by an act inter vivos, of any private parcels of banks, the State enjoys the right of first refusal, under the terms of civil law, and this preference may be exercised, if applicable, only over the fraction of the property that is integrated into the bank.

The State may proceed, under the terms of general law, to the expropriation for public utility of any private parcels of banks whenever this proves necessary to subject all private parcels existing in a certain zone to the public domain regime.

The lands acquired by the State in accordance with the provisions of this article are automatically integrated into its public domain.

Article 60

Delimitations

The delimitation of the domanial beds and banks bordering lands of another nature is the responsibility of the State, which proceeds with it ex officio, when necessary, or at the request of the interested parties, always under the terms of the law and with the participation of representatives of the owners of the lands bordering the beds or banks to be delimited.

The delimitation is published in the Boletim Oficial and registered in the register of rights and water resources.

The delimitation carried out by administrative means does not preclude the competence of the common courts to decide on the ownership or possession of the banks or their parcels.

If, however, the interested party intends to challenge the act of delimitation for any of its own defects that do not translate into a question of ownership or possession, they must file the respective administrative appeal for annulment.

Article 61

Administrative Easements over Private Parcels of Banks

All private parcels of banks are subject to an administrative easement under the terms of this Code.

Article 62

Classification as an Adjacent Zone

The Government may classify as an adjacent zone the area contiguous to the bank of a river that extends up to the line reached by the maximum flood with a probability of occurrence in a period of one century (100-year flood).

The diploma that classifies the adjacent zone defines, within it, the areas of prohibited or conditioned built-up occupation.

Areas that, according to the studies carried out, are presumed to be classified under this article, may be subject to preventive measures, under the terms of the law.

The approval of urban development plans or projects and urbanization contracts, as well as the licensing of urban land subdivision operations or of any works or buildings, relating to areas contiguous to watercourses that have not yet been classified as adjacent zones, requires a binding opinion from the competent body in matters of water resources management when they are within the limit of the largest known flood or of a 100 m (one hundred meters) strip on each side of the river's bank line, when that limit is unknown.

Article 63

Regime of the Adjacent Zone

In the areas delimited as prohibited built-up occupation zones, it is forbidden to:

a) Destroy the vegetation cover or alter the natural relief, with the exception of the practice of traditionally integrated crops in agricultural explorations;

b) Install dumps, scrap yards, or any other deposits of materials;

c) Erect buildings or carry out works likely to constitute an obstruction to the free passage of waters;

d) Divide the rural property.

In the areas referred to in the preceding number, the implementation of indispensable infrastructures or the execution of hydraulic correction works depends on a binding opinion from the competent bodies, under regulatory terms.

The areas classified as referred to in No. 1 may be used for the installation of leisure equipment, provided that they do not involve the construction of buildings, upon a binding opinion from the competent bodies, under regulatory terms.

In the areas delimited as conditioned built-up occupation zones, the installation of buildings that constitute an indispensable complement to others already existing and duly licensed is only permitted, upon a favorable opinion from the competent body in matters of water resources management.

The levels of the lower floors of the buildings to be constructed in the areas referred to in the preceding number must always be higher than the levels foreseen for the 100-year flood, and this requirement must be expressly referred to in the respective licensing process.

All acts or licenses that disregard the regime referred to in the preceding numbers are null and void.

Article 64

Subjection to Registration

The real encumbrance resulting from the classification of an area as an adjacent zone is subject to registration in the register of rights and water resources.

Article 65

Embargo and Demolition

The competent bodies in matters of territorial planning, natural resources, or water resources management may directly promote the administrative embargo and demolition of works or other actions carried out in violation of the provisions of the law regarding adjacent zones.

The embargoing entity shall notify the owner to demolish the works done or to restore the land to its previous state within the period set for them, after which, the demolition or restoration is carried out at the owner's expense.

Any company that continues with works or actions that have been embargoed, under the terms of this article, may, without prejudice to other legal procedures, be prevented from participating in public tenders for the supply of goods and services to the State, for a period not exceeding two years, and may also be subject to the penalty of suspension or revocation of its license by the competent body.

Article 66

Obligation of Cleaning and Unblocking of Water Lines

In the beds and banks that are part of the public water domain, it is the responsibility of the entities with jurisdiction over them to carry out the works aimed at their cleaning or unblocking.

When it comes to a water line inserted in an urban agglomeration, the responsibility referred to in the preceding number falls to the respective municipality.

The owners or possessors of parcels of banks that are not part of the public water domain must keep them in a good state of conservation, proceeding with their regular cleaning and unblocking.

The cleaning and unblocking of the lands mentioned in the preceding number, if required by the occurrence of exceptional circumstances, namely climatic, that involve actions of regularization, landfills, excavations, or alterations of the vegetation cover, are the responsibility of the entities mentioned in No. 1.

CHAPTER III

Legal Easements for Water

Section I

General Provisions

Article 67

General Principle

Easements for water may exist for the exercise of water rights derived from a license or concession, for the execution of hydraulic works, and for other public utility purposes related to the exploitation and management of water resources, under the terms of this Code.

Article 68

Types

Legal easements for water may be common or administrative.

Common easements for water are encumbrances imposed by law on a certain property for the exclusive benefit of an individually determined holder or holders of a private use right.

Administrative easements for water are encumbrances imposed by law on a certain property for the benefit of the public utility of a thing or service.

Article 69

Establishment

Common easements for water are established by contract or by judicial decision, under the terms of civil law.

Administrative easements for water are established by the non-opposition of the owner, or, in the event of impossibility or great difficulty in contacting them, of the person who legally holds the use and enjoyment of the servient property, and, in case of opposition, by an administrative act of the competent body, under the terms of administrative laws and regulations.

Article 70

Inalienability, Unattachability, and Imprescriptibility

Legal easements for water are inalienable and unattachable and cannot be acquired by usucaption (adverse possession).

Article 71

Compensation

Legal easements for water grant the owner of the servient property the right to fair compensation to the extent that the easement prevents, conditions, or limits its normal enjoyment or involves an effective decrease in its value.

In common easements for water, the obligation to compensate falls upon the holder of the private use right and, if there are several, jointly upon all of them, in proportion to their respective benefits or, if it is impossible to determine the share of each, equally.

In administrative easements for water, the obligation to compensate falls upon the public law legal person holding the dominant thing or service or, in the case of a concessioned or licensed service, upon the concessionaire or licensee.

The payment of compensation, whether definitive or provisional, as fixed under the terms of the applicable laws and regulations, must be prior to or contemporaneous with the start of the exercise of the easement, unless there is a written agreement to the contrary.

Article 72

Regime

In all matters not regulated by this Code, the relevant provisions of civil law shall apply to common easements for water.

Administrative easements for water are negative or positive, can only be imposed by an administrative act after hearing the interested parties, and they cease with the cessation of the public domain status or public utility of the dominant thing or service.

Administrative easements are imposed and defended by the authority of the Public Administration, which, independently of judicial action and decision, may, namely, compel the interested parties to comply with the obligations arising from the easement and, after notification, take the necessary measures to defend the public utility of the dominant thing or service, especially by demolishing works done in contravention of the law, occupying lands, and using them or other things.

In all matters not regulated by this Code and in other administrative laws and regulations and which is not contrary to their nature, the provisions for predial easements in civil law are applicable to administrative easements for water.

Article 73

Exercise of the Easement

The extent and object of the rights and duties inherent to the easement cannot be altered, nor can it be exercised for a purpose different from that for which it was established, unless by agreement of the parties or by a judicial or administrative decision, as applicable, under penalty of an administrative offense and fair compensation, in common terms, to the holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property for the damages suffered as a consequence of the alteration or illicit exercise.

Section II

Common Easements for Water in Particular

Article 74

Easement for the Use of Water for Domestic Purposes

When it is not possible for the holder of the use and enjoyment of a property, without excessive inconvenience or expense, to obtain water for their domestic needs on their property or from public fountains intended for that use or from public watercourses, the possessors of neighboring properties may be compelled to permit the use of surplus water from the springs or reservoirs existing on those properties and to which they have the right of private use, to the extent indispensable for those needs.

Urban properties, their adjacent yards, gardens, or grounds, and walled agricultural exploitations are exempt from the easement for use.

Article 75

Easement for the Use of Water for Agricultural Purposes

The holder of the use and enjoyment of a property intended for agricultural purposes who does not have and cannot obtain, without excessive inconvenience or expense, sufficient water for its irrigation, has the right to use the existing waters in neighboring properties that are unused, paying the State its fair value.

The provision in the preceding number is not applicable to waters subject to concession, nor does it allow the exploitation of groundwater.

Article 76

Common Easement of Dam

The holder of the use and enjoyment of a property and the owner of an industrial establishment who has the right to use waters from a public watercourse existing on another's property may carry out on that property the necessary works for the damming and diversion of the respective water, upon payment of the compensation corresponding to the damage caused, when they can only make use of the water to which they are entitled by building a dam, weir, or similar work that will obstruct the other's property.

Dwelling houses, and their contiguous yards, gardens, or grounds are not subject to the easement of dam, unless it is materially or economically impossible to carry out the work without their use.

The holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property may use the work if they prove they have the right to use the water and make the work common by paying a part of the costs of its construction and maintenance proportional to the benefit they receive.

Article 77

Easement of Private Hydraulic Work

In addition to the provisions of Article 1346 of the Civil Code, the holder of the use and enjoyment of a property may be compelled to permit, upon compensation, the execution of private hydraulic works for protection, mixed use, or exploitation for agricultural, industrial, or tourist purposes, suitable for the exercise of the right of private use of water resources attributed for the said purposes, when such works are indispensable for the holder of this right of use to be able, without excessive expense, to exercise it normally and the prejudice to the servient property resulting from the work is less than the benefit that results from the work for the use of water resources.

The easement to which this article refers covers the extent of land necessary for the implementation of the work and the perimeters intended for the protection area and their respective access and maintenance strips, under the terms established by regulation.

Article 78

Easement of Drainage

In addition to the provisions of Article 1345 of the Civil Code, the forced establishment of an easement of drainage is permitted, upon compensation, when:

a) By human work and for agricultural, industrial, or tourist purposes, waters arise in a property or are conducted to it from another property;

b) It is intended to give a defined direction to waters that followed their natural course;

c) It concerns waters from any method of land drainage;

d) It concerns surplus waters from a concession for the exploitation of water resources.

The holders of the use and enjoyment of the properties burdened with the easement of drainage may eventually use the surplus or flowing waters for their private use, under the terms of the laws and regulations.

In the settlement of the compensation, the value of the benefits that accrue to the servient property from the use of the water under the terms of the preceding number is taken into account, and in the case of paragraph b) of No. 1, the prejudice that already resulted from the natural course of the waters is considered.

Only properties that can be burdened with a common easement of aqueduct are subject to the easement of drainage.

Article 79

Common Easement of Aqueduct

The holder of a right of private use of water resources may, for the purposes of agriculture, industry, or tourism, or for domestic needs, transport the water to which they are entitled, by means of underground pipes or canals or surface channels, through others' rural properties, not being yards, gardens, or grounds contiguous to dwelling houses.

The nature, direction, layout, form, and characteristics of the aqueduct and its ancillary works shall be the most convenient for the dominant holder from a technical and economic point of view, and the least onerous for the servient property.

The construction and maintenance of the aqueduct and ancillary works are the exclusive responsibility of the dominant holder, but the holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property may, at their own expense and with the authorization of the dominant holder, execute any other works intended to minimize the burdens of the easement.

Article 80

Compensation for Easement of Aqueduct

The holder of the use and enjoyment of the property servient to an aqueduct is entitled to compensation for the prejudice that results from the work to the said property.

The compensation to be paid by the dominant holder must cover the value of the land effectively occupied by the aqueduct and ancillary works.

The extent of land considered effectively occupied always includes a strip located on each side of the aqueduct, with a width to be established by regulation, with a minimum of 1 m (one meter) along its entire length, intended for the maintenance of the aqueduct, for the reception of waste and debris from its cleaning, and on which no plantations or works may be carried out that prejudice the said purposes, except with the consent of the dominant holder.

When the aqueduct is routed along slopes, the side strips extend, in their entirety, along the side of the corresponding valley or stream.

The holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property has, at all times, the right to also be compensated for the prejudice that may result from the infiltration or eruption of waters or from the deterioration of the works made for their conduction.

Article 81

Prohibition of Diverting Water from the Aqueduct

The holder of the use and enjoyment of a property servient to an aqueduct must refrain from any activity that obstructs the free course of the waters through the aqueduct, as well as from using them in any way, even in non-consumptive uses, without the prior written authorization of the dominant holder.

The holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property is civilly liable for any subtraction, diversion, or reduction of the water flow that occurs in the section of the aqueduct that passes through the said property, without prejudice to other applicable sanctions.

If, however, the water of the aqueduct is not all necessary for the dominant holder and the holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property wishes to have a share in the surplus, that part may be attributed to them, upon license and by paying the proportional share of the expense incurred for its conduction to the point from which they intend to derive it.

Article 82

Accumulation of Aqueducts

The holder of the use and enjoyment of a property subject to an easement of aqueduct may oppose the establishment of a new easement of the same type whenever the existing aqueduct is usable for the purposes intended by the new easement.

Administrative Easements for Water in Particular

Article 83

Administrative Easement of Dam

The concessionaire for the exploitation of water resources or the holder of the corresponding license may, for supply or sanitation purposes incumbent upon them, carry out on another's property the necessary works for the damming and diversion of the water existing on the said property, upon payment of the compensation corresponding to the prejudice caused, when they can only make use of the water to which they are entitled by building a dam, weir, or similar work that will obstruct the other's property.

Dwelling houses, and their contiguous yards, gardens, or grounds are not subject to the administrative easement of dam, unless it is materially or economically impossible to carry out the work without their use.

The easement is considered established as a consequence of the concession or license, but the compensation, in the absence of an agreement, is fixed by the court.

The holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property may use the work if they prove they have the right to use the water and make the work common by paying a part of the costs of its construction and maintenance, proportional to the benefit they receive.

Article 84

Administrative Easement of Public Hydraulic Work

In addition to the provisions of Article 1346 of the Civil Code, the holder of the use and enjoyment of a property may be compelled to permit on that property, upon compensation, the execution of hydraulic works of the public domain.

The easement to which this article refers covers the extent of land necessary for the implementation of the work and the perimeters intended for the protection area and their respective access and maintenance strips, under the terms established by regulation.

Article 85

Administrative Easement of Public Aqueduct

The concessionaire for the exploitation of water resources or the holder of the corresponding license may, for supply or sanitation purposes incumbent upon them and upon fair compensation, transport and distribute water, by means of underground pipes or canals or surface channels, through others' rural properties.

The easement is considered established as a consequence of the concession or license, but the compensation, in the absence of an agreement, is fixed by the court.

The norms of the preceding section referring to the common easement of aqueduct are subsidiarily applicable to the easement of public aqueduct.

Article 86

Easement of Right of Way

When, for their domestic needs, the inhabitants of a geographically isolated area or locality not covered by a supply concession or license do not have, without excessive inconvenience or expense, other access to a fountain, well, or public reservoir of drinking water, an easement of passage through domanial lands or, upon compensation, through private property lands that, with less prejudice, can provide that access, is established in their benefit.

Article 87

Easement of Bank

All private parcels of banks are subject to the easements established by law and, namely, to an easement of public use in the general interest of access to the bed and the waters and of passage along them, as well as in the interest of the supervision and policing of the waters by the competent authorities.

On the private parcels of banks, as well as on their respective subsoil and corresponding airspace, the execution of any works, permanent or temporary, is not permitted without a license from the competent body.

The owners of private parcels of public banks are subject to all the obligations that the law establishes with respect to the execution of hydraulic works, namely for correction, regularization, conservation, unblocking, and cleaning.

If, from the execution by the State of any of the works referred to in the preceding number, prejudices result that exceed the charges resulting from the legal obligations of the owners, the State must compensate them.

If it becomes necessary, for the execution of these works, any portion of private land, even if located beyond the banks, the State may expropriate it.

Article 88

Easement of Free Flow

The holders of the use and enjoyment of properties through which waters transit permanently or intermittently are obliged to keep the respective courses free of any obstacles that may impede their normal course, without prejudice to any duly authorized protection works.

g) Judicial redemption of the easements for the use of water for domestic or agricultural purposes;

h) Supervening lack of necessity for the easement;

i) Written renunciation by the dominant holder.

Common legal easements for water are extinguished by written agreement between the interested parties or by judicial decision at the request of the holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property, except in cases of redemption or renunciation.

The extinction of the easement by renunciation does not require the acceptance of the holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property nor a judicial declaration.

Judicial redemption can only be declared by demonstrating that the holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property intends to make a justified use of the water and provided that at least ten years have passed since the establishment of the easement.

In the extinction due to lack of necessity, if there has been compensation, it is restored in whole or in part, according to the circumstances, unless at least 10 (ten) years have passed since the establishment of the easement.

The private works done on the servient property for the exercise of the easement that cannot be removed without serious prejudice to that property become an integral part of it, upon compensation to the dominant holder for their value that should not be considered amortized.

Article 90

Administrative Easements

Administrative easements for water are extinguished automatically by the cessation of the public domain status of the assets or of the public utility of the things or services for whose benefit they were established.

The extinction of administrative easements is confirmed by an administrative act of the competent body, at the request of the holder of the use and enjoyment of the servient property, under regulatory terms.

It is the undeniable duty of all persons not to pollute or prejudice the natural quality of water, refraining from any act or behavior from which, immediately or subsequently, directly or indirectly, pollution or degradation of the quality of the aquatic environment may result, negatively affecting public health and the soil.

The application of water quality standards may not, directly or indirectly, result in any deterioration of the current quality of water for human consumption, to the extent that this is relevant for the protection of human health and the soil, nor jeopardize compliance with the quality standards of waters intended for the production of water for human consumption.

Article 165

Obligation to Clean Reservoirs

Public and private reservoirs intended for water storage and the devices intended for its transport must be subjected to cleaning in the manner and with the frequency and regularity determined by the competent body, under penalty of suspension or revocation of the water transport license or of sealing the reservoir or transport device.

Article 166

Restrictions for the Protection of Water Quality

In cases of serious danger to the quality of water in a given area, the Technical Regulator may restrict, totally or partially, the use of water, for a determined period or as long as the danger persists. The respective decision must fix the content, scope, and duration, when determined, of the restriction, the modes of its operation, and the administrative sanctions for its violation, as well as give notice of the measures intended to restore normality.

The Technical Regulator must order, in particular, the closure of wells, cisterns, or other devices and of any hydraulic work intended for supply when the health authority verifies that the water contained therein is unsuitable for human consumption and endangers public health.

The Technical Regulator must establish technical norms and standards on the following activities:

a) The use, storage, distribution, transport, and commercialization of manures, fertilizers, pesticides, and any other chemical element likely to contaminate or pollute water resources;

b) Systems for watering animals and for the evacuation of wastewater from livestock activities, namely from the washing of installations and anti-parasitic baths;

c) Boreholes and wells, determining, namely, the sealing of those that are deactivated in order to avoid the contamination of aquifers.

Article 167

Prohibitions in Protection Areas

In the protection areas of hydraulic works, established in accordance with the respective regulation, the following are prohibited:

a) Agricultural, industrial, or commercial activities of any nature;

b) Mining research and activities;

j) Any other activity likely to alter the quality or availability of the waters.

The execution, within a fifty-meter radius around springs, watercourses, or natural bodies of water, whether permanent or intermittent, of any of the activities referred to in the preceding number, is subject to the prior authorization of the Technical Regulator, without prejudice to the same Regulator being able to fix larger protection areas.

The violation of the provisions of the preceding numbers obliges the violator to execute, within the period fixed, the works determined by the Technical Regulator, under penalty of being executed by the latter at the expense of the violator, without prejudice to any other applicable sanctions.

Article 168

Prohibitions on the Use of Polluted Water

In case of water pollution, the Technical Regulator may order the suspension of the exploitation of any hydraulic work or the interdiction of the use of the water until the necessary measures are taken to eliminate the pollution and the factors that caused it, without prejudice to any other applicable sanctions.

When the person responsible for the pollution does not, being able to do so, cause the cause that determines it to cease or does not adopt the measures indicated to them by the competent body to eliminate it, the latter may also determine or promote the suspension or extinction of the violator's private right of use.

Article 169

Civil Liability for Pollution and Degradation

Whoever, with intent or mere negligence, violates the provisions of this Code and its complementary diplomas, affecting the quality of the aquatic environment with negative consequences for public health and the soil, is obliged to compensate the State for the damages caused, without prejudice to other disciplinary, administrative, or criminal sanctions established by law.

What is referred to in the preceding number does not prejudice the exercise by private individuals of a claim for compensation based on general law for the redress of individually suffered damages.

When it is not possible to quantify with precision the damage caused, the court must fix, using criteria of equity, the amount of compensation, taking into consideration, namely, the injury to the environmental component, the foreseeable cost of restoring the situation prior to the damaging act, and the economic benefit resulting from the practice of the violation.

In the case of a concurrence of violators, liability for the damage is joint and several.

The claim for compensation based on the violation of the provisions of this diploma is always brought before the common courts.

Environmental defense associations with legal personality have standing to bring the action for compensation provided for in the preceding numbers.

Companies that are party to adaptation and environmental promotion contracts are not, by that fact, exempt from the liability provided for in this article.

Article 170

Accredited Laboratories

The tests leading to the verification of compliance with this Code and its complementary diplomas in matters of water quality must preferably be carried out by laboratories accredited for this purpose by the Technical Regulator or by laboratories that participate in quality control programs managed by a national reference laboratory, and, in their absence, must be carried out by laboratories that maintain a duly documented and updated analytical quality control system.

Article 171

Analytical Methods

Entities that resort to laboratories using analytical methods different from the reference analytical methods established by regulatory diploma must prove to the Technical Regulator that they lead to results equivalent and comparable to those obtained with the latter, namely with regard to the limits of detection, accuracy, and precision.

CHAPTER II

Quality of Water Intended for the Production of Water for Human Consumption

Article 172

Scope of Application

The provisions of this chapter apply to the quality of fresh surface waters and groundwaters used or intended to be used for the production of water for human consumption.

Article 173

Quality of Fresh Surface Waters Intended for the Production of Water for Human Consumption

Fresh surface waters intended for the production of water for human consumption are classified into categories, according to the water quality standards to be approved by regulation, to which correspond different standard treatment schemes defined to make them suitable for human consumption.

The authorization for the abstraction of surface water intended for the production of water for human consumption presupposes the verification of the following conditions:

a) Prior classification of the surface waters where the abstraction point is located and the setting of normative quality values that they must comply with;

b) Adequacy of the proposed treatment scheme to the classification of the surface waters where the abstraction point is located.

Surface waters intended for the production of water for human consumption are subject to mandatory parametric values fixed in tables established by regulation and duly publicized, which are relevant for the purpose of controlling water quality, in general, and for compliance with the obligations of water quality protection established in this Code.

The Technical Regulator must fix the applicable values for all sample collection points, regarding the established parameters.

The normative values fixed in accordance with the preceding number may not be less stringent than the corresponding MAV for the category of waters attributed.

The Technical Regulator must regularly proceed with the verification of the conformity of surface waters with the quality standards they must comply with, through sampling according to reference analytical methods and respecting the indicated values as limits of detection, precision, and accuracy, with the frequency and under the terms fixed by law or regulation.

The results of the analytical campaigns carried out for the determination of the quality of surface waters and the verification of their conformity with the respective quality standards must be communicated to the managing entities in the month following that to which they relate and made available to the public.

With a view to safeguarding the imperatives of public health protection, the Technical Regulator must communicate to the managing entities and to the health authority the verified alterations in the observed parameters as soon as it ascertains that these alterations result in a change in the classification of the surface waters and whenever a significant degradation of their quality is verified.

Surface waters whose quality is lower than that of the lowest classification category may not be used for the production of water for human consumption, unless this is expressly authorized by the Technical Regulator in exceptional circumstances and in the absence of technically or economically viable alternatives, and provided that the water is subjected to an appropriate treatment process that confers upon it quality characteristics in conformity with the quality standards of water for human consumption.

The derogation provided for in the preceding number must be framed within an Action and Management Plan, under terms to be regulated.

The provisions of this article may not be applied when:

a) Floods or natural catastrophes occur;

b) Situations of water crisis or emergency are verified;

c) Exceptional meteorological or geographical circumstances are verified and provided that the non-compliance only concerns parameters whose violation does not create a danger to public health;

d) Waters subject to a process of natural enrichment in certain substances are at issue, which implies that the limits fixed for the classification categories of surface waters are exceeded.

For the purposes of the provision of the preceding number, a duly justified derogation request must be formulated, indicating the period foreseen for the derogation, the parametric values that may be observed during that period, and the proposal of measures to be taken, it being incumbent upon the health authority to certify the existence of a risk to public health, to grant or not the derogation, and to define the terms to which it must be subject.

If it ascertains the existence of a risk to public health, the health authority must immediately inform the managing entities of the potentially affected supply systems of this fact, it being incumbent upon it to decide on the possible interdiction of the abstraction.

The Technical Regulator must prepare an annual technical report on the application of the provisions of this article and make it known to other authorities responsible for the management of water resources as well as to the managing entities, and it must also be made available to the public.

The report referred to in the preceding number is prepared under regulatory terms, within a period of 9 (nine) months after the period to which it relates.

Article 174

Quality of Groundwaters Intended for the Production of Water for Human Consumption

Groundwaters that present a quality superior or equal to that of the highest category of fresh surface waters intended for the production of water for human consumption are considered suitable to be used as a source of water for the production of water for human consumption, corresponding to them the standard treatment scheme indicated for that category of waters, with the necessary adaptations.

The authorization for the abstraction of groundwaters intended for the production of water for human consumption presupposes the prior verification of their suitability and the setting of the normative quality values that they must comply with.

The provisions of Nos. 3 to 10, 14, and 15 of the preceding article apply to groundwaters, with the necessary adaptations.

When the results of the analytical campaigns for the determination of water quality reveal pesticide concentrations higher than those fixed in the water quality standards to be approved by regulation, the Technical Regulator must inform the authorities responsible for the management of water resources of that situation.

The Technical Regulator, in collaboration with competent bodies and the interested municipalities, must determine protection areas for groundwater abstractions, the conditions to which these areas are subject, and the appropriate control system.

The protection areas must be included in the municipal territorial planning plans.

Article 175

Quality of Water Treated by Industrial Systems and Intended for the Production of Water for Human Consumption

Water treated by industrial processes, such as desalination, and intended for the production of water for human consumption is subject, with the necessary adaptations, to the same requirements and quality control system as surface waters intended for the production of water for human consumption.

The Government encourages the use of the best technologies for the production of water for human consumption treated by industrial systems.

The competent bodies shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure the appropriate use of desalinated waters.

CHAPTER III

b) Spring waters in the part contemplated by the specific legislation on the matter;

c) Waters that are considered medicinal products.

Article 177

Objectives

The regime of the quality of water intended for human consumption aims to protect human health from the harmful effects resulting from any contamination of that water and to ensure the tendentially universal availability of wholesome, clean, and desirably balanced water in its composition.

Article 178

Exemptions from the Application of Quality Standards

The Technical Regulator may determine an exemption from the application of the standards contained in this Code and its complementary diplomas, in the following situations:

a) When the water is intended exclusively for purposes for which the health authority has determined that the quality of the water has no influence, direct or indirect, on the health of consumers;

b) In the case of water intended for human consumption from individual sources that are subject to consumption of less than 10 m³ (ten cubic meters) per day, on average, unless that water is supplied within the scope of a public activity or a private activity of a commercial, industrial, or service nature.

In the cases provided for in paragraph b) of the preceding number, the Technical Regulator ensures that the served population is informed of the granted exemption and that the health authority informs of the necessary measures to protect human health from the harmful effects resulting from any contamination of the water for human consumption.

Whenever a potential danger to human health due to the quality of the water is identified, the Technical Regulator shall communicate the existence of such danger to the health authority and provide appropriate advice to the served population.

Article 179

Quality Standards

Water intended for human consumption must respect the parametric values fixed by regulation, which are relevant for the purpose of controlling water quality, in general, and for compliance with the correction obligations provided for in this Code.

If the protection of human health so requires, the health authority shall fix the applicable values for other additional parameters, which must, at a minimum, meet the quality requirements for water for human consumption after hearing the managing entity and the Technical Regulator.

The population must be informed in simple and easily understandable language of the mandatory parametric values and of all alterations made within the scope of the provision of the preceding number.

Article 180

Obligations Regarding Water Quality

The managing entities of production, supply, and distribution systems must ensure that the water intended for human consumption is wholesome, clean, and desirably balanced, namely that:

Except as provided in the following number, the use of wastewater for human consumption is prohibited, even if subjected to purification and treatment.

The Technical Regulator, after consulting the health authorities, may however authorize the use of treated wastewater for human consumption if the technological and other relevant conditions are met and the quality parameters contained in regulations so advise.

Article 184

Verification of Conformity

The control of water quality is carried out in accordance with the requirements to be approved by regulation.

The verification of compliance with the parametric values, fixed under the terms of Article 179, is made:

a) In the case of water produced in any form, at the point of exit from the production site;

b) In the case of water supplied from a reservoir, at the point where it exits that reservoir;

c) In the case of water supplied from a distribution network, at the point where, inside an installation or establishment, it exits the taps normally used for human consumption;

d) In the case of water supplied from water transport and distribution vehicles, at the point where it exits that means of transport;

e) In the case of water intended for sale in bottles and other containers, with or without commercial purposes, at the end of the filling line;

f) In the case of water used in a food industry company, at the point of use;

g) In the case of municipal or multi-municipal systems, at the point of delivery to the respective users.

In the situations referred to in paragraphs a) and d) of the preceding number, the responsibility of the managing entity ceases whenever it is proven that the non-compliance with the parametric values, fixed under the terms of the preceding article, is due to the building distribution system or its maintenance.

In the case of establishments or installations where water is supplied to the public, namely schools, hospitals, and restaurants, it is incumbent upon the managing entity to clarify to those responsible for the establishment the possible anomalies in water quality resulting from their specific systems.

The occurrence of the situations mentioned in the two preceding numbers is communicated by the managing entity to the Technical Regulator.

Following the provision of the preceding number, the Technical Regulator must alert the owners of the building installations to the need to take appropriate measures to reduce or eliminate the risks of non-compliance with the parametric values and order the adoption of other measures, in order to reduce or eliminate the risks of non-compliance with the parametric values after distribution.

Whenever the Technical Regulator orders the adoption of other measures, under the terms of the preceding number, it must designate the entity responsible for the adoption of such measures and verify their effectiveness.

The Technical Regulator must also ensure that the affected consumers are duly informed and advised on any supplementary corrective measures they should take.

Article 185

Quality Assurance

In order to guarantee the quality of the distributed water and without prejudice to others established by law, regulation, or determination of the Technical Regulator, the following are obligations of the managing entity:

a) To submit for the approval of the competent body a quality control program that must respect the regulatory requirements, including the sampling points, as well as the credentials of the laboratories that perform the analyses;

b) To carry out the verification of water quality, in accordance with the program approved under the terms of the preceding paragraph, with a view to demonstrating its conformity with the quality standard of water for human consumption, using for this purpose the reference analytical methods established by regulation;

c) To inform the health authority and the Technical Regulator of situations of non-compliance with the parametric values established by regulation and of other situations that pose a risk to human health, as soon as they become aware of them;

d) To disseminate among the affected consumers the notices that the health authority determines regarding precautionary measures to minimize the effects of water consumption in the situations referred to in the preceding paragraph;

e) To prepare and maintain, for each supply zone, a register containing:

f) To make the information referred to in the preceding paragraph accessible to the public;

g) To communicate, obligatorily, to the Technical Regulator, by March 31 of the year following that to which they relate, the results of the verification of the quality of water for human consumption, as well as the measures taken or to be taken to correct detected non-conformities;

h) To publicize, quarterly, in the case of water supplied from a distribution network, by means of notices posted in appropriate places and by publication in the press, the results obtained in the conformity demonstration analyses, accompanied by informative elements that allow an assessment of the degree of compliance with the quality standards.

The managing entity may resort to alternative analytical methods to those established by regulation, provided it proves to the Technical Regulator that the results obtained are at least as reliable as those that would be obtained by the established methods.

The managing entity must perform samples corresponding to the conformity assessment, periodically, throughout the year in order to obtain a representative image of the quality of the water distributed by the respective systems in that period.

Whenever disinfection is part of the water treatment scheme for human consumption, it is incumbent upon the managing entity to ensure its effectiveness and guarantee, without compromising disinfection, that the contamination by its by-products is kept at a level as low as possible and does not compromise its quality for human consumption.

When the management and exploitation of a water supply system for human consumption is under the responsibility of two or more managing entities, each of them shall comply, for the components of the system for which it is responsible, with the provisions of this diploma, in accordance with criteria to be established in a regulatory diploma.

Article 186

Sanitary Surveillance

It is incumbent upon the health authorities to coordinate the sanitary surveillance actions which include:

a) The execution of analyses and other actions, when necessary, for the assessment of the quality of water for human consumption;

b) The assessment of the risk to public health, of the quality of water intended for human consumption;

c) Assessing the hygio-sanitary conditions of the personnel and of the operation of the managing entity's installations.

When it is verified that the quality of the distributed water is likely to pose a risk to human health, the health authorities must notify the managing entities of the measures that must be adopted to minimize such effects, and may also determine the suspension of the water distribution as long as the risk factors persist.

In the case referred to in the preceding number, the health authorities and the managing entities must join efforts to inform the population of the risk factors for public health.

The health authority must order the closure of wells, reservoirs, or any hydraulic work intended for the supply of water for human consumption when it verifies that it is unsuitable for human consumption or likely to pose a risk to public health.

Article 187

Corrective and Preventive Measures and Restrictions on Use

Whenever a situation of non-compliance with the parametric values fixed by regulation is verified, the managing entity must immediately investigate the cause and ensure the necessary corrective measures are taken to restore the quality of the water intended for human consumption, paying special attention to the deviation in relation to the fixed parametric value and the potential danger to human health.

Once a situation of non-compliance with the parametric values fixed by regulation is verified, the managing entity must notify the Technical Regulator and the health authority, providing an account of the corrective measures adopted or in progress to restore the quality of the water intended for human consumption and of their results.

The health authority must advise the consumers of the planned corrective measures, unless it considers that the non-compliance with the verified parametric values is irrelevant.

In situations where, despite the measures adopted, the non-compliance with the parametric values persists, the Technical Regulator must promote and coordinate the investigation of the causes of such non-compliance, it being incumbent upon the health authority to inform and advise the affected consumers and to determine the adoption of exceptional measures when public health is at risk, including the restriction or prohibition of supply or the adoption of any other necessary measure to protect human health.

The adoption of the exceptional measures mentioned in the preceding number is defined by the health authority in collaboration with the managing entity, taking into account the risks to human health arising from the interruption of the supply or the restriction of the use of water. It is incumbent upon the managing entities to provide an alternative source of water for human consumption to their respective consumers, provided that the said measures are maintained for more than twenty-four hours.

In case of non-compliance with the norms related to water quality, the responsibility falls upon the managing entity responsible for the component in which the violation of the norms is verified, unless that entity technically demonstrates that it is not possible for it to comply with the norms due to circumstances attributable to another entity.

In addition to the corrective measures and restrictions referred to in the preceding numbers, preventive measures may be imposed on the managing entities aimed at preventing future situations.

Article 188

Inspection

The Technical Regulator carries out inspection actions related to water quality at any point of the supply system, alerting the health authority and the managing entity to any detected irregularities.

In the case where the alteration of the quality of water for human consumption is due to the quality of the water at its source, the results of the inspection action are also communicated to the territorially competent body in matters of water resources.

Article 189

Materials and Chemical Products in Contact with Water

The materials used in supply systems that are in contact with water for human consumption may not cause alterations in its quality that imply a reduction in the level of human health protection, as provided for in this Code.

The substances and chemical products used or intended to be used in the treatment of water for human consumption, as well as any impurities they may possess, may not be present in the distributed water in values higher than those established, nor may they, directly or indirectly, create risks to human health.

The Technical Regulator must promote the necessary actions for the certification of the quality of the materials, substances, or chemical products used in the treatment of water and in the supply systems, by duly accredited or recognized certification bodies, guaranteeing their suitability for the intended purpose, namely with regard to the protection of human health.

For the purposes of the provisions of the preceding numbers, the materials, substances, or chemical products may only be applied or introduced into the water supply systems if, on the date of application or use, they conform to internationally accepted specifications.

Article 190

Promotion of the Quality of Water for Human Consumption

It is incumbent upon the managing entity to take the necessary measures to ensure the continuous improvement of the quality of the water it supplies, namely, through action plans that include programs for the maintenance, exploitation, recovery, and expansion of existing systems and the construction of new systems.

In the elaboration of the plans and programs referred to in the preceding number, the managing entity must take into account the need to increase the percentage of the population served by public supply systems and to improve the quality of the existing systems.

The Technical Regulator promotes the adoption by the managing entities of quality management systems based on the ISO standards relevant to the sector.

Article 191

Individual Sources

The licensing entity for individual sources shall communicate the granting of the respective licenses to the corresponding local authorities, for control purposes, and to the health authorities, for the purpose of their subjection to sanitary surveillance, whenever these entities consider it justified.

Those responsible for individual sources must adapt to the provisions of this diploma, and must alert the local authorities and the health authorities whenever significant alterations in the quality of the water occur.

Article 192

Private Supplies

The licensing entity for private supplies must communicate the granting of the respective licenses to the corresponding local authorities and health authorities, for control and sanitary surveillance purposes, whenever they consider it justified.

CHAPTER IV

Quality of Water for Irrigation

Article 197

Scope

The norms of this chapter apply to waters for irrigation, whatever their origin.

Article 198

Objectives

The criteria and standards for the quality of irrigation waters aim to protect public health, the quality of surface and groundwaters, the crops that may be affected by the poor quality of irrigation waters, and the soils whose suitability for agriculture may be degraded by the systematic use of poor-quality irrigation waters.

Article 199

General Duty

The holders of rights to use water for irrigation must exercise it in such a way as to avoid being a source of pollution or the spread of diseases.

Article 200

Classification

Surface and groundwaters, and those from treated wastewater, intended for irrigation must be classified by the Technical Regulator according to the criteria to be approved by regulation.

The authorization for the abstraction of water intended for irrigation presupposes the prior classification of those waters as irrigation waters and the setting of the normative quality values that they must comply with.

As long as the classification mentioned in No. 1 has not been carried out, the authorization for the abstraction of water intended for irrigation may be issued provided that, in addition to compliance with other legally fixed requirements, the MAV of the parameters fixed by the Technical Regulator are not exceeded, after consulting the competent bodies in matters of environment, water resources, and agriculture.

Article 201

Quality Standards

Irrigation waters are subject to mandatory parametric values fixed by regulation and duly publicized, which are relevant for the purpose of controlling water quality, in general, and for compliance with the obligations of water quality protection provided for in this chapter.

The Technical Regulator must fix, upon a proposal from the governmental department responsible for agriculture, for all irrigation waters, the applicable values with regard to the established parameters.

With regard to the parameters for which the MAV have not been fixed, the Technical Regulator may fix, after consulting other interested bodies, the values to be considered according to the risk inherent in the mode of consumption or contact with the irrigated crops.

Taking into account the interaction of factors such as soil, climate, cultural practices, irrigation methods, and crops, the established MAV may be exceptionally exceeded, upon a favorable opinion from the environmental, natural resources, and agricultural authorities.

Article 202

Verification of Conformity

The Technical Regulator must, in collaboration with the governmental department responsible for agriculture and other entities with competencies in the management of hydro-agricultural exploitations, proceed regularly and in accordance with a previously defined plan, to determine the quality of irrigation waters with a view to verifying their conformity with the standard fixed under the terms of the preceding article, using the reference analytical methods and the minimum sampling frequency established by regulation.

Irrigation waters are considered to be in conformity with the quality standard if, for the totality of the samples, the values of the determined parameters respect the values fixed in the standard.

The results of the analytical determinations mentioned in the preceding numbers, as soon as available, must be compulsorily communicated to the environmental, natural resources, agricultural, and health authorities, with the additional information necessary for the purpose of assessing the existence of a risk of contamination of the soil, surface and groundwaters, and a risk to public health.

Article 203

Use of Wastewater in Irrigation

The use of wastewater in the irrigation of agricultural and forest crops is conditioned by a license from the environmental authority and depends on a favorable opinion from the health authority and the authority for agriculture and forests.

The use of wastewater in the irrigation of public gardens depends on the authorization of the environmental authority, upon a favorable opinion from the competent health authority.

The use of wastewater, even if treated and purified, in the irrigation of horticultural and fruit crops is prohibited, except with the authorization of the Technical Regulator, after consulting the competent health authority.

Article 204

Action Plans

In the circumstances referred to in No. 4 of Article 201, action plans to systematically improve the quality of irrigation water shall be prepared by the Technical Regulator, in collaboration with the governmental department responsible for agriculture.

CHAPTER V

Quality of Bathing Waters

Article 205

Objective

The quality standards for bathing waters are intended to preserve these waters from pollution and to protect the environment and public health.

Article 206

Classification

The classification of waters as bathing waters is made by the environmental authority, with the collaboration of the competent bodies in matters of water resources and upon a binding opinion from the health authority.

Surface and coastal waters that present a quality equal to or superior to that of the quality standard established by regulation and that do not present any other risk situation for the health of users are considered suitable to be used for bathing purposes.

The classification of any waters for bathing purposes is obligatorily preceded by the verification of their suitability and by the setting of the normative values to which the following article refers.

Article 207

Quality Standards

In a specific quality standard for each of the bathing waters, the environmental authority must fix which normative values are applicable for the parameters fixed by regulation.

Article 208

Verification of Conformity

The determination of the quality of bathing waters with a view to verifying their conformity with the quality standard fixed for them is made by the environmental authority using the reference analytical methods, in the ways and with the frequency established by regulation.

Bathing waters are considered to be in conformity with the quality standard fixed under the terms of the preceding article if the values of the parameters, determined under the preceding terms, show that they satisfy the normative values fixed by regulation.

The results of the conformity verification analyses must be made public and, immediately and prior to their public disclosure, communicated to the health authority for the purposes of sanitary surveillance.

The zones of the hydrographic basins located upstream of the bathing waters must be periodically examined by the environmental authority, in order to determine the volume and nature of all polluting or potentially polluting discharges, their respective geographical and topographical data, as a function of the distance that separates them from the bathing zones, as well as the effects of the discharges on the quality of the bathing water.

The environmental authority must carry out supplementary analyses whenever the existence or probability of discharges of substances likely to diminish the quality of the bathing water is revealed, or when there is any other reason to suspect a decrease in its quality.

Deviations from the regulatory values are not taken into consideration when they are a consequence of floods, natural catastrophes, or exceptional meteorological conditions duly certified by the meteorological and civil protection authorities.

Article 209

Sanitary Surveillance

It is incumbent upon the health authority to coordinate the sanitary surveillance actions which consist of:

a) Assessing the safety and operating conditions of the facilities surrounding the bathing zones;

b) Carrying out analyses that complement the assessment of the quality of the water in the bathing zones, in accordance with the reference methods to be defined in regulation;

c) Carrying out studies oriented towards the assessment of risk factors, when justified by environmental or epidemiological data;

d) Assessing the risk to health from the quality of the bathing waters.

When it is found that the quality of the waters poses a risk to health, the health authority shall, within the scope of its own competence, prohibit the use of these waters for bathing purposes, notifying the environmental authority and also the maritime authority of this fact.

Article 210

Derogations

Safeguarding the imperatives of public health protection, the provisions of this chapter regarding limit values may not be applied:

a) For certain parameters fixed by regulation when exceptional meteorological circumstances occur;

b) When the bathing waters are subject to natural enrichment in certain substances.

The verification of the exceptional circumstances referred to in the preceding number is the responsibility of the environmental authority, which must obtain confirmation from the competent bodies of the situations referred to, respectively, in paragraph a) or paragraph b) of the preceding number.

The environmental authority shall present to the health authority a duly justified derogation request, indicating the period foreseen for the derogation, the parametric values that may be observed during that period, and the proposal of measures to be taken. It is incumbent upon the health authority to certify the existence of a risk to public health, to grant or not the derogation, to immediately communicate its decision to the interested bodies, and to publicize it.

Article 211

Report

The environmental authority, in collaboration with the Technical Regulator and the health and maritime authorities, must prepare an annual technical report on the application of the provisions of this Code and its regulatory diplomas regarding the quality of bathing waters, which is sent to the Government and made available to the public.

The report referred to in the preceding number is prepared under regulatory terms, within a maximum period of six months after the period to which it relates, and it must contain a brief description of the improvement programs intended for the bathing zones that do not respect the established values, including the timetable for the works and the necessary investments.

CHAPTER VI

Protection of Waters against Pollution Caused by Discharges of Wastewater

Section I

General Discharge Norms

Article 212

Objective

The provisions of this chapter are intended to reduce or eliminate the pollution caused by the discharge of wastewater into the aquatic environment and into the soil.

Article 213

Scope

The provisions of this chapter apply to the discharge of wastewater into surface and coastal waters, into territorial waters, into groundwaters, and into the soil, as well as to the discharge into collectors, when this is expressly referred to.

The provisions of this chapter do not apply to domestic wastewater discharged into the soil and originating from small isolated units that are not connected to a sewerage network and that are located outside the protection zones of water abstractions intended for human consumption.

Article 214

Obligation to Connect to a Sewerage System

When a sewerage system or network exists, the use of the said system or network is mandatory.

The owners of the properties located next to the roads served by the public network must:

a) Install a building-level network, with all its accessories, and assume the expenses inherent to its connection to the public network;

b) Connect that private network, once approved by the competent body, to the service connection or connections of the public network.

The obligation established in the preceding number applies to all dwellings in each building and to all buildings occupied or occupiable, intended for housing or for economic or public service activities.

Where the said systems or networks do not exist, the municipalities shall promote and provide technical assistance to the owners of the properties with a view to the construction of individual sanitation systems that are sanitarily acceptable.

Article 215

Discharge Standards

The discharge standards are fixed, for each installation, by the environmental authority, taking into account, cumulatively:

a) The general discharge standards established by regulatory diploma;

b) The short, medium, and long-term environmental objectives established by the national strategic plan for water resources and by the water resources plans for hydrographic districts and specific programs for each substance, group, family, or category of substances that are in force for the receiving environment;

c) The conditions established in specific legal diplomas, when certain hazardous substances are at issue;

d) The conditions contained in an adaptation or environmental promotion contract and the sectoral discharge standard that concerns them, for discharges from installations covered by such contracts;

e) The provisions relating to the quality of fresh surface waters intended for the production of water for human consumption of this Code, if the waters of the receiving environment or the bodies of water located downstream, likely to have their quality affected by the discharge, are classified as a source of water for the production of water for human consumption;

f) The conditions of Chapter IV of this title, if the waters of the receiving environment or the bodies of water located downstream, likely to have their quality affected by the discharge, are classified as irrigation waters;

g) The conditions of Chapter V of this title, if the waters of the receiving environment or the bodies of water located downstream, likely to have their quality affected by the discharge, are classified as bathing waters.

Without prejudice to the provision of the following number, the ELVs of each substance, group, family, or category of substances and other parametric values to be considered are fixed in the discharge standard according to the most stringent criterion among those mentioned in the preceding number.

For the installations covered by environmental promotion or environmental adaptation contracts, in the fixing of the ELVs, the norms contained in the respective contracts shall prevail.

For the purposes of No. 2 and as long as the plans and specific programs referred to in paragraph b) of No. 1 are not in force, the minimum quality environmental objectives for fresh surface waters are considered to be the objectives fixed by the environmental authority, which may, justifiably, determine more stringent conditions in the discharge of wastewater than those that would result from the application of the provisions of the preceding numbers.

The following are considered justifiable reasons for the determination of more stringent conditions for the discharge of wastewater:

a) The receiving environment is classified as a sensitive or vulnerable zone or as an agricultural reserve;

b) The pollution caused by the discharge may have long-distance effects;

c) The receiving environment is located in an area designated for the protection of habitats or species for which the conservation or improvement of water quality is an important factor for their protection;

d) The receiving environment is classified as a vulnerable zone, under the terms of Chapter VII of this title.

In the circumstances referred to in No. 4, and if one or more of the justifying reasons for determining more stringent conditions for the discharge of wastewater provided for in the preceding number exist, the environmental objectives to be considered by the environmental authority in fixing the ELVs for each substance, group, family, or category of substances and other parametric values must be the most stringent among the quality environmental objectives referred to in No. 1 and the quality standards that are associated with the identified justifying reasons.

For installations located in the zone of influence recognized by the environmental authority for integrated treatment solutions, but which do not intend to benefit from them for the treatment of their wastewater, discharge standards less stringent than those fixed for these integrated solutions may not be set, even if such installations belong to companies adhering to adaptation or environmental promotion contracts.

Sectoral discharge standards are adopted by regulation.

Article 216

General Licensing Conditions

The emission or discharge of wastewater into water and soil by an installation requires a license, to be issued by the environmental authority, in which the discharge standard and other applicable conditions are fixed.

In agricultural and forest soils, the issuance of a license requires the opinion of the bodies in charge of such areas.

The discharge standard is understood to refer to the quality of the wastewater before it is subject to any natural dilution in the receiving environment.

The use of treatment plants to comply with the emission limit values for substances, families, or groups of substances and for the other parameters contained in the discharge standard must be considered after the study and application of appropriate measures to reduce pollution at the source.

When treatment plants exist, the ELVs for the substances and parameters contained in the discharge standards are understood to refer to the quality of the wastewater at their outlet, unless provided otherwise.

Compliance with the ELVs contained in the discharge standard for substances and parameters through any deliberate dilution operation of the previously treated wastewater is illicit, and its rejection is considered, for all effects, as non-compliant with the standard.

The license must be refused if the applicant declares that it is not possible for them to respect the imposed discharge standard or if the environmental authority verifies this impossibility.

It is incumbent upon the environmental, health, and agriculture, forestry, and livestock authorities, as well as the Technical Regulator, to inspect the observance of the discharge standard and other conditions of the license.

If the imposed discharge standard or other conditions of the granted license are not respected and there is no danger to public health or the environment, the managing entity is notified of the verified infraction, and a deadline is set for its correction.

If this deadline expires without the correction having been made, without prejudice to the application of other sanctions provided for by law, the discharge is prohibited and the license is revoked.

The environmental authority must send to the health, water resources, and agriculture, forestry, and livestock authorities, as well as to the Technical Regulator, a copy of all licenses issued for the discharge of wastewater into water and soil within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of their issuance.

Article 217

Protection of Surface Waters against Pollution Caused by the Discharge of Hazardous Substances

With a view to eliminating the pollution of surface waters through hazardous substances, the ELVs, quality objectives, and other conditions to which the discharges of these substances must comply are fixed in regulation.

Annexed to the diploma referred to in the preceding number will be a list of families or groups of hazardous substances, based on toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation, for which the protection provided for in this article must operate.

In the diploma referred to in No. 1, the adaptation period to be granted to the installations already in operation on the date of its entry into force is also fixed, after which the discharge licenses are re-examined, as are the reference analytical methods to be used for the verification of conformity and the other conditions that this discharge must comply with, which may eventually also concern the discharge into the soil.

The discharge of hazardous substances into sewerage collectors shall comply with the conditions fixed in the diploma provided for in No. 1, which shall prevail over any other provision or regulation that may be in force.

In the case where it is found that the authorization for the discharge provided for in the preceding number does not respect the provisions of the diploma provided for in No. 1, the environmental authority must determine the rectification of the discharge conditions, this not being considered compliant, for all effects, until it complies with the conditions fixed in the said diploma.

Article 218

Protection of Groundwaters against Pollution Caused by the Discharge of Hazardous Substances

The direct discharge into groundwaters of substances from the families or groups of hazardous substances listed in the annex to the regulation referred to in No. 1 of the preceding article is prohibited.

The actions of elimination, or of deposit for the elimination, of the substances from the families or groups of hazardous substances referred to in the preceding number may only be authorized if it is previously demonstrated by the requesting entity that, by means of adequate technical precautions in these actions of elimination or deposit, it is possible to prevent their indirect discharge into groundwaters.

The environmental authority must take the necessary and appropriate measures to prevent or limit any indirect discharge of hazardous substances due to actions carried out on the surface or in the interior of the soil different from those mentioned in the preceding number.

If the license applicant provides prior proof that the groundwaters into which a discharge of hazardous substances is foreseen are permanently unsuitable for any use, namely for domestic or agricultural use, that the presence of these substances does not jeopardize the exploitation of soil resources, and that through adequate technical precautions there is no risk of these substances reaching other waters or harming other ecosystems, the environmental authority may authorize the discharge, conditioned on the adoption by the licensed entity of the said technical precautions.

The authorizations and licenses referred to in Nos. 2 and 4 may only be granted after the environmental authority has verified that the continuous monitoring of the groundwaters, and especially of their quality, is assured.

The prior proof to which No. 4 refers includes, in addition to the other elements required by laws and regulations to instruct the license application, a study of the hydrogeological conditions of the respective zone, of the eventual purifying power of the soil and subsoil, of the risks of pollution and alteration of the quality of the groundwaters by the discharge, and the proof that the discharge into these waters constitutes an adequate solution from an environmental point of view.

When a direct discharge, or an action of elimination or deposit with a view to the elimination of hazardous substances that inevitably leads to an indirect discharge, is authorized in accordance with Nos. 2 and 4, the license must contain, in addition to the other legally required elements, the following elements:

a) The location of the discharge or the location where the action of elimination or deposit with a view to elimination is situated;

b) The discharge technique or the methods of elimination or deposit used;

c) The indispensable precautions to which the discharge or action of elimination or deposit with a view to elimination will be subject, taking especially into account the nature and concentration of the substances present in the wastewater or in the materials to be eliminated or deposited, the characteristics of the receiving environment, as well as the proximity of water abstractions, especially for the production of water for human consumption, of springs, and of natural mineral waters;

d) The maximum quantity of each hazardous substance admissible in the wastewater or in the materials to be eliminated or deposited, as well as the acceptable concentrations of these substances;

e) The technical precautions provided for in No. 4 to prevent any discharge of hazardous substances into waters other than the groundwaters in which the direct or indirect discharge is licensed;

f) The devices that allow for the control of the wastewater discharged into the groundwaters;

g) If necessary, the measures that allow for the control of the groundwaters and particularly of their quality.

The licenses referred to in Nos. 2 and 4 are reviewed, at least, every 4 (four) years, and may be extended, modified, or revoked.

The provisions of this article prevail over the provisions of the other articles of this chapter and any other norms that contradict them.

Article 219

Environmental Promotion Contracts

With a view to promoting the improvement of the quality of waters and the protection of the aquatic environment through the gradual reduction of pollution caused by the discharge of wastewater into the aquatic environment and into the soil, environmental promotion contracts may be celebrated between the representative associations of the economic activity sectors, on the one hand, and the State, on the other.

The contracts mentioned in the preceding number must conform to the national and hydrographic district water resources plans and to the action and management plans established by the State.

The object of the said contracts is the definition of discharge standards more stringent than those in force for the activity sector and for the adhering companies, to be taken into account by the licensing entity when renewing the discharge licenses, in the fixing of the discharge standards to be respected by the same companies, as well as the granting of a deadline and a calendar to be complied with by them in the application of the said standards.

The terms of the environmental promotion contract can only be applied to the renewal of the discharge licenses of the installations of the business units of the sector that expressly adhere to it within three months from its signing.

It is incumbent upon the representative associations of an economic activity sector interested in the celebration of an environmental promotion contract to submit for the consideration of the environmental authority a promotion plan and its associated calendar, it being incumbent upon the latter, after consulting other interested bodies and the Technical Regulator, to propose its approval to the Economic Regulator.

The environmental authority shall accept the environmental promotion plan and the calendar established therein as a reference for the inspection of the activity of the installations of the adhering companies with respect to the compliance with their environmental obligations.

During the term of the contract, whenever non-compliance with the promotion plan by an installation linked to it is found, the managing entity of the installation will be notified of the verified infraction, and a deadline will be set for its correction, with an indication of the consequences in case of non-compliance.

Companies whose installations remain in a state of non-compliance after the deadline fixed under the terms of the preceding number may be excluded from the contract by a justified decision of the environmental authority.

The discharge standards referred to in No. 3 are fixed, in each case, by a joint ordinance of the member of the Government responsible for the environment sector and the member of the Government responsible for the economic activity sector.

In the renewal of the discharge license of the companies of the sector that have not adhered to the environmental promotion contract, the licensing entity may not fix conditions less stringent than those contained in that contract, namely with respect to the ELVs to be observed.

The contracts to which this article refers must be publicized within 15 (fifteen) days following their celebration through an announcement to be published in two of the national newspapers with the largest circulation, the announcement must contain, in a summarized form, the object of the contract, as well as the conditions for adhesion to it.

Article 220

Verification of Conformity

It is incumbent upon the entity whose discharge has been licensed under the terms of Article 216 to carry out control of the quality of the wastewater, which includes the determination of the physical and chemical characteristics for the assessment of its conformity with the ELVs fixed in the discharge standard, in accordance with the reference analytical methods established by regulatory diploma.

The licensed entity may request authorization from the environmental authority to use other analytical methods, it being incumbent upon it to prove, in conformity with the provisions of this title, that the limits of detection, precision, and accuracy of the same are at least comparable with those of the reference analytical methods.

The frequency of sampling and of carrying out analytical determinations is determined by the environmental authority and fixed in the license.

The methods of continuous measurement or of collection of wastewater samples for the purpose of assessing the conformity of the emission values with the discharge standard contained in the license are determined by regulation or, in its absence, transitorily, by the environmental authority.

The wastewater is considered compliant if the values determined for all parameters simultaneously comply with the conditions established in a regulatory diploma or, in its absence, transitorily by the environmental authority.

The licensed entity must communicate to the environmental authority the results of the self-monitoring, in accordance with what is established in the license.

Article 221

Inspection

It is incumbent upon the environmental, natural resources, water resources, maritime, and agriculture, forestry, and livestock authorities, as well as the Technical Regulator, to exercise the inspection of compliance with the wastewater discharge standards.

Whenever a situation likely to pose a risk to public health and the quality of the waters is detected, the entities with inspection competence must take the measures that are justified in each case to prevent or eliminate that risk, and the suspension of the operation or the preventive closure in whole or in part of the polluting unit may be determined.

The situations described in the preceding number must be communicated to the environmental authority and to the health authority, accompanied by an indication of the measures adequate for their resolution.

The inspection entities may, whenever necessary, request the collaboration of the administrative and police entities in the exercise of the inspection actions.

Official reports are drawn up from the inspection activities, which serve as a means of proof of the occurrences verified by the agents in service.

Article 222

Report

The environmental authority, in collaboration with other interested bodies and with the Technical Regulator, must prepare an annual technical report on the application of the provisions of this chapter, namely with regard to the discharges of hazardous substances into the aquatic environment.

TITLE VIII

ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL REGIME OF WATER RESOURCES

CHAPTER I

General Provisions

Article 262

Objective

This title establishes the economic-financial regime of water resources, fixing the norms by which the determination, payment, and collection of canons, taxes, tariffs, and emoluments directly related to the use of water resources, as well as the celebration of program contracts in matters of water resources management, should be guided.

The concepts of canon, tax, tariff, and emolument, for the purposes of this Code and its regulations, are those established in Article 3.

Article 263

Guiding Principles

The use of water resources and of hydraulic works and equipment is onerous, and no natural or legal person, public or private, may be exempt from the payment of the established canons, taxes, tariffs, and emoluments, unless there is an express provision of law to the contrary.

The canons, taxes, tariffs, and emoluments provided for in this Code and other specially applicable legislation are the only considerations due for the various public services that enable the use of water resources.

The resale of water is prohibited, except in the situations provided for by law and upon special authorization from a legally competent entity.

The economic and financial regime of water resources aims to:

a) Promote a sustainable use of water resources through the tendential internalization of the costs and benefits that are associated with the use of water;

b) Promote the principle of equivalence, with the taxes that comprise it being structured and applied in such terms that their distribution among the users of water resources is made to the extent of the cost they cause to the community and to the extent of the benefit that the community provides them;

c) Provide for universal and equitable access and a rational, efficient, and fair distribution of drinking water, the improvement of sanitation conditions, and the creation of a healthy environment;

d) Guarantee the financial equilibrium of the sector;

e) Foster the optimal use of water resources by seeking methods and systems that allow for their rational exploitation, avoiding losses, waste, or inadequate uses;

f) Serve as an instrument of general economic policy and contribute to the realization of the national plans and those for hydrographic districts for water resources;

g) Regulate the costs of agricultural production, taking into consideration the objectives of the price policy for the producer and the consumer;

h) Guarantee the participation of the direct beneficiaries in the financing of the investments, in the exploitation costs, and in the formation of eventual replacement funds, proportionally to the increase in benefits obtained by virtue of the greater availability of water.

CHAPTER II

Of Canons

Article 264

Abstraction Canon

The holders of the right to use water, by means of a license or concession, are subject to an abstraction canon calculated as a function of the volume of water abstracted and the final value of each cubic meter of water, determined according to parameters and criteria established by a regulatory diploma and whose annual variation is fixed by a Government Resolution.

The abstraction of maritime waters for desalination and for the replacement of fresh waters in swimming pools, sewage networks, industrial refrigeration, and others, which is not subject to the abstraction canon, is excepted from the provision of number 1, without prejudice to the payment of any due taxes or emoluments, under the terms and in the cases provided for in this Code.

The abstraction canon is fixed annually by the Economic Regulator based on the provisions of this article and upon a proposal from the Technical Regulator.

Article 265

Reductions of the Abstraction Canon

If the water abstracted directly from the water environment, before being used, already presents a high degree of pollution, an assessment of the water quality may be made at the user's request and at their expense, and if it is lower than the minimum quality established in the legislation in force, the canon to be paid is reduced by the same percentage.

The holders of the right to use waters who return part of the abstracted flow to the environment, in equal conditions of quality and availability, or who allow its use by other consumers, benefit from a reduction of the abstraction canon, proportional to the flow returned or used by the other consumers.

When it is verified that a presented project has as its object the significant minimization of the environmental impacts resulting from the respective use, the abstraction canon may be provisionally reduced by up to 20%, for a maximum period of three years, becoming definitive and permanent if, after the execution of the project, the foreseen effective minimization is verified, with the canon being due in its entirety in the contrary case.

Article 266

Determination of the Volume of Water Abstracted and Returned

The determination of the volume of water abstracted and returned may be made by direct measurement of the quantity actually abstracted and returned by the user, at any time, by means of the installation of a meter.

In the act of licensing, the obligation of direct measurement may be established, whether due to the dimension of the use or to its potential impact on the water environment.

When direct measurements of the abstracted or returned quantities cannot be or have not been made, their determination is made by estimation from coefficients that express the volume of water abstracted and returned per characteristic unit of water-consuming activity, in the following terms:

a) The product of the specific coefficients of abstraction and return, respectively, by the number of characteristic units of the activity, in the case of economic activities;

b) The product of the average annual abstraction, in terms of abstraction and return, by the number of equivalent inhabitants, in the case of urban agglomerations.

The specific coefficients of abstraction or return associated with each group of economic activities, according to the Classification of Economic Activities (CAE), as well as the average per capita rates for classes of urban agglomerations are fixed by Ordinance.

Article 267

Rejection or Discharge Canon

The holders of the right to discharge or reject wastewater are subject to a rejection or discharge canon fixed by the environmental authority in the very act that authorizes the discharge or rejection, in conformity with parameters and calculation criteria established by a regulatory diploma, taking into account, namely:

a) The pollutant load rejected;

b) The investments made by the interested parties to minimize the adulterating or polluting effects.

The amount of the canon may be modified by the environmental authority when significant changes in its parameters and calculation criteria are verified.

The canon must be paid annually by the holder of the right of use.

Article 268

Reductions of the Rejection or Discharge Canon

If the users carry out treatment of wastewater, the value of the canon to be paid is reduced as a function of the efficiency of that treatment relative to the parameters subject to the canon.

When it is verified that a presented project has as its object the significant minimization of the environmental impacts resulting from the respective use, the rejection or discharge canon may be provisionally reduced by up to 20% (twenty percent), for a maximum period of three years, becoming definitive and permanent if, after the execution of the project, the foreseen effective minimization is verified, with the canon being due in its entirety in the contrary case.

Article 269

Determination of the Rejected Pollutant Load

The determination of the pollutant loads in relation to each pertinent parameter may be made by direct measurement of the loads actually rejected by the polluting source.

In the act of licensing, the obligation of direct measurement may be established, whether due to the dimension of the use or to its potential impact on the water environment.

When direct measurements of the pollutant loads cannot be or have not been made, their determination is made by estimation from coefficients that express the load produced per characteristic unit of polluting activity, in the following terms:

a) The product of the specific coefficients of gross pollution by the number of characteristic units of the activity, in the case of economic activities;

b) The product of the average annual pollutant loads per inhabitant by the number of equivalent inhabitants, in the case of urban agglomerations.

The specific pollution coefficients associated with each group of economic activities, according to the Classification of Economic Activities (CAE), as well as the average annual pollutant loads per inhabitant, the methodology for determining the number of equivalent inhabitants per urban agglomeration, and the efficiency values of the treatments are fixed by ministerial ordinance.

Article 270

Special Canons

The environmental authority may fix special canons for non-consumptive uses, to be paid jointly with the taxes and emoluments due in relation to the main activity of the holder of the right of use.

Article 271

Ascertainment of the Values for the Calculation of Canons

The ascertainment of the values and base parameters for the calculation of the canons is made from the conditions established in the licenses and concessions or from the declarations referred to in the following number, without prejudice to the provision of number 3 of this article.

When direct measurements occur, the users are obliged to:

a) Periodically present a declaration of an official model established by a regulatory diploma, containing, as applicable, the volumes of water abstracted and returned and the pollutant load rejected in the preceding period;

b) Periodically record in a proper book, of an official model established by a regulatory diploma, the daily values of the volumes of water abstracted and returned and of the rejected pollutant load.

The values and base parameters for the calculation of the canons are, however, specifically fixed by the competent body when:

a) There is no direct measurement;

b) The declaration referred to in paragraph a) of the preceding number has not been presented or the user does not present it within 15 (fifteen) days after notification for that purpose;

c) The declared values do not correspond to reality;

d) The book referred to in paragraph a) of the preceding number does not exist or is not duly filled out and updated.

CHAPTER III

Taxes

Article 272

Beneficiation Tax

The holders of rights to use water who are direct beneficiaries of public interest hydraulic works, constructed with financing from the State or other public legal persons, are subject to a beneficiation tax to be fixed by the Economic Regulator for each work.

For the determination of the beneficiation tax, the amount of the part of the investment to be borne by the direct beneficiaries is fixed, taking into account the following criteria:

a) The costs related to feasibility studies, execution projects, inspection, and insurance are not considered;

b) Only the interest and financial charges of the direct credits for the construction of the work are accounted for;

c) The indirect benefits of the undertaking, in a percentage not less than 20% (twenty percent) nor more than 50% (fifty percent) of the construction value of the work, are deducted by estimation;

d) In the case of a multiple-use undertaking, the calculations must be made separately for each specific group of consumers;

e) The values, plus their respective legal interest, of the contributions of the beneficiaries, whether in cash, in credits, materials, or personal labor, must be deducted.

The part of the investment to be borne by the direct beneficiaries and calculated according to the criteria established in the preceding number is distributed among them proportionally, taking into consideration the following factors:

a) The possible increase in production obtainable from the greater availability of water;

b) The economic capacity of the beneficiary;

c) The characteristics of each productive activity and the incidence that the use of water has on it;

d) The production costs of the benefited activity;

e) The prices of the respective products in the national market.

The share of each beneficiary is attributed for the normal amortization period of the work and must be paid annually, starting from the second year or, in the case of irrigation water, from the third year after the start of the work's operation.

Article 273

Conservation and Exploitation Tax

The holders of rights to use water who are direct beneficiaries of a specific public interest hydraulic work are subject to the payment of a conservation and exploitation tax to be fixed by the Economic Regulator based on the arithmetic division of the estimated cost of exploitation by the volume of water calculated to be produced in the respective year.

A progressive tax may be fixed, in conformity with the amounts of water actually used, or differentiated taxes for the different uses. In any case, they must be fixed in such a way that the revenues are balanced with the calculated cost of exploitation and conservation.

For the purposes of the provisions of the preceding numbers, the managing entities of a public interest hydraulic work must present to the Economic Regulator, by the month of November of each year, a budget of the costs of exploitation and conservation of the respective work, taking into account the following criteria:

a) The expenses proportional to the quantities of water produced are assessed in conformity with the amounts of water distributed and the prices in force in the immediately preceding year;

b) The fixed expenses are calculated in conformity with the forecasts contained in the sectoral and local planning and with the prices in force at the time of the presentation of the respective budget;

c) The differences of the previous fiscal year between the approved budget and the amounts actually spent must be added or reduced;

d) To the total obtained, a percentage not exceeding 10% may be added for extraordinary expenses.

Expenses proportional to the quantities of water produced are all those that derive from activities that are only executed when the work is in effective exploitation, namely energy and fuel, renewal and maintenance of electromechanical equipment, and eventual chemical products for treatment and purification.

Fixed expenses are considered those that must be borne independently of the productive output of the work, namely personnel salaries, maintenance and amortization of constructions and vehicles, payment for the provision of services, and administrative expenses.

Article 274

Tax for the Extraction of Inerts from Riverbeds

The extraction of arid materials from the riverbeds and inland waters is subject to a tax, fixed by the environmental authority as a function of the quantity of material extracted and the value of each cubic meter of that material.

Article 275

Tax for the Occupation of Lands or Water Surfaces

The holder of a license or concession who occupies, for private use, lands of the water domain and water surfaces, is subject to an occupation tax calculated based on the area of land or water surface effectively occupied and on the value of each meter of land or water surface, assessed taking into account the average value of the land in the contiguous occupied area.

The ascertainment of the values and base parameters for the calculation of the tax is made from the conditions established in the licenses and concessions or from the declaration referred to in the following number, without prejudice to the provision of No. 4.

The occupant must present, within 30 (thirty) days after the end of the civil year in which the respective license was issued or the respective contract was celebrated, a declaration of an official model established by a regulatory diploma, indicating the area of land or water surface occupied.

The values and parameters for the calculation of the occupation tax are specifically fixed by the licensing entity when:

a) The declaration to which number 3 refers has not been presented or the occupant does not present it within 15 (fifteen) days after notification for that purpose;

b) The declared values do not correspond to the truth.

CHAPTER IV

Tariffs

Article 276

General Principles

The tariff system to be practiced by the entities that provide public supply and sanitation services, in addition to being subordinated to the guiding principles established in Article 263 of this Title, must attend to the following fixing criteria:

a) To ensure the tendential recovery and in a reasonable period of the initial investment and of the investments for substitution, modernization, and expansion, deducted from co-financing and non-repayable subsidies;

b) To ensure the maintenance, repair, and renewal of all goods and equipment assigned to the service;

c) To ensure the recovery of the level of costs necessary for the operation and efficient management of the resources used in the pursuit of the service, deducted from other revenues not from tariffs and that are related to the provision of that service;

d) To ensure an adequate remuneration of the invested capital;

e) To guarantee the application of a tariff to be paid by the consumer that progresses as a function of the intensity of the use of water resources, while preserving the access to the service for domestic users, taking into account their socioeconomic condition with respect to certain consumptions;

f) To incentivize the efficient use of water resources.

The tariffs must be fair and reasonable, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

The tariffs must be published in the Boletim Oficial.

The tariffs must also be publicized in newspapers of appropriate circulation for the universe of consumers.

The tariffs are established by the Economic Regulator.

Article 277

Calculation and Invoicing

The form of calculation of the tariffs and of the invoicing of the public supply and sanitation services, as well as other aspects related to the tariff system, is established by a regulatory diploma.

The invoice presented to the consumer of the public supply and sanitation services must disaggregate all applicable taxes and charges, explaining the respective calculation process.

Article 278

Competitive Services

Without prejudice to the maximum price fixed by the Regulator, where there is effective competition in the services to which they apply, the tariffs may be based on the values practiced in the market.

Article 279

Non-competitive Services

When the services are provided in a non-competitive regime, the tariffs must be based, unless there is a special provision of the legislator to the contrary, on the system of a maximum price for a five-year period, subject to a triennial review, with minimal punctual readjustments being permitted based on unforeseen network expansion costs, extraordinary alterations in the cost of distribution by vehicles, or another significant cost factor.

The tariffs must be established at a level that guarantees the concessionaire an opportunity to recover the costs incurred in the provision of the service and other charges provided for by law, in order to ensure them an adequate return on the risks assumed.

The tariffs must be established in such a way as to constitute a sufficient incentive to promote the efficiency and rational use of water and the sanitation system.

The tariff readjustments, when executed, must be concretized in a way that minimizes economic disturbances.

The tariffs must be indexed so as to reflect changes in the prices of goods and services in the country, so that significant alterations in the consumer price index must be proportionally reflected in the adjustments made to the tariffs.

The tariffs must reflect the costs of providing the service to the various classes of consumers covered by them and the costs associated with the operation of goods in which the concessionaire did not invest or which were donated to the State.

The tariffs must likewise reflect the costs associated with the prevention or mitigation of environmental damages, to health, or to public safety.

Article 280

Tariff Categories

The Economic Regulator may establish uniform tariffs by category within a given area or create consumer categories based on common service cost zones.

The following may also be established, namely:

a) Progressive tariffs, according to the quantities consumed or drained during a given period;

b) Special tariffs for the installation of appliances or devices intended for the storage or increase of water availability;

c) Special tariffs for certain uses considered luxurious;

d) Connection or reconnection tariffs;

e) Tariffs for special services, namely for technical assistance, maintenance, and repair of domestic installations and the like;

f) Conservation tariff for wastewater networks;

g) Special tariffs for the supply of vehicles, ships, or aircraft;

h) Special tariffs for mineral-medicinal waters; and

i) Tariffs for special use waters.

Article 281

Consumer Categories

The Economic Regulator may divide consumers into categories to differentiate prices, reflecting differences in the use of water by public entities and for residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial, and other purposes, and in the cost of providing the service.

For the fixing of tariffs by consumer categories, the Economic Regulator must ascertain the costs and revenues of the different categories.

The tariffs for each consumer category must reflect the totality of the accepted costs of providing the service to that category.

The subsidization of one consumer category by another can only be accepted on the grounds of national policy or social solidarity duly approved by the Government.

Article 282

Special Contracts

Consumers may, upon prior approval from the Economic Regulator, celebrate special contracts with concessionaires or licensees.

The approval of special contracts can only be given when it is demonstrated that the cost of providing the service to the consumer is different from that of providing the service to any of the consumer categories referred to in the preceding article.

Article 283

Bases for Fixing

The tariffs must, preferably, be fixed on a volumetric basis.

In the fixing of tariffs, the Economic Regulator must separate the fixed and variable elements of which they are composed.

Article 284

Interconnection Tariffs

The tariff system for connection to the network must establish the terms and conditions to be met by independent producers and self-producers of water or of sanitation services and the values they must pay for the connection of their systems to the corresponding public systems under the charge of concessionaires or licensees.

Article 285

Expansion and Connection Costs

The Economic Regulator may approve connection and reconnection fees for consumers outside the service areas, reflecting the respective cost.

The Economic Regulator may accept that the costs be compensated through installments or other financing mechanisms in order to make the service more accessible.

A consumer who benefits from an expansion paid for by another consumer must, under the terms to be regulated, contribute to part of the expansion costs in proportion to the level of their contracted consumption, with the first consumer thus being reimbursed for their expenditure.

Article 286

Tariffs for Water Distribution by Vehicles or Standpipes

The Economic Regulator establishes the tariffs for water distributed by vehicles or standpipes in the public supply systems.

Differentiated tariffs may be established in conformity with the distance between the point of reception or abstraction and the point of delivery.

For the purposes of the provision of the preceding number, the Economic Regulator must regularly survey the market, doing so at least once every two years.

Article 287

Revision of the Calculation System

At the end of each 5 (five) year period of validity of the tariff calculation system, the Economic Regulator may alter it.

In the third year of the concession contract's validity, if it is demonstrated that the calculation system is misaligned, causing prejudice to the concessionaire or to the consumers, the Economic Regulator may review one or more elements of the calculation system, in order to fix fair and reasonable tariffs.

Article 288

Contractual Revisions

Other tariff revisions may be made under the terms provided for in the concession contract or in the license and whenever it is necessary to restore the financial equilibrium of the contract.

CHAPTER V

Emoluments

Article 289

Services Paid by Emoluments

Emoluments may be charged:

a) For the issuance and renewal of licenses for rights of water use;

b) For authorizations for the construction, modification, or inutilization of hydraulic works;

c) For authorization for the discharge of wastewater and its renewals;

d) For authorization for the transport and distribution of water in vehicles and ships;

e) For a certificate of any nature issued by a competent body;

f) For a copy of technical norms for the construction, modification, inutilization, exploitation, or conservation of hydraulic works;

g) For authorization for the extraction of arid materials from the riverbed;

h) For authorization for hydraulic studies and research;

i) For authorizations for provisional activities and constructions in the riverbed;

j) For inscriptions, annotations, certificates, and other acts of the cadastre or register of water resources.

Article 290

Fixing and Form of Payment

The value of the emoluments and the form of their payment are established by a regulatory diploma, without prejudice to the provision of the following number.

The emoluments are due and paid prior to the practice of the act to which they relate.

CHAPTER VI

Collection and Payment

Article 291

Creditor Entity

The product of the canons, taxes, and legal surcharges constitutes revenue of the Technical Regulator.

The product of the tariffs and legal surcharges constitutes revenue of the entities that provide the public supply and sanitation service.

The product of the emoluments constitutes revenue of the service that authorized the act to which they are subject.

Article 292

Allocation of Revenues from Canons, Taxes, and Emoluments

The revenues from the collection of canons, taxes, and emoluments of water resources are applied in the following manner:

a) In the financing of activities that have as their objective to improve the efficiency of water use and the quality of water resources;

b) In the financing of actions to improve the state of the waters and associated ecosystems;

c) In the coverage of the other costs incurred in the management of the water resources subject to use and protection.

Article 293

Water and Sanitation Fund

The Water and Sanitation Fund, abbreviated as FASA, is created, which has as its primary objective to guarantee investments in the improvement of the quality of the existing water and sanitation infrastructures and their progressive extension, aiming for the universal, safe, reliable, and efficient provision of the respective services.

FASA may also, through studies, support the transformation of public water and sanitation service operators, with deficient operational and financial performance, into legally independent institutions that operate with high levels of technical and commercial efficiency.

The plans, programs, and activities financed by FASA always take into account the objectives of gender, environmental, and social equality, in order to guarantee equity and equality of opportunities in the water and sanitation sector.

The statutes of FASA are approved under the terms of the law.

Article 294

Sanctions for Non-payment

The non-payment of canons, taxes, or tariffs may give rise to the application of the following sanctions:

a) Collection of late payment interest at the legal rate or at the conventional rate;

b) Suspension of the water supply until the full settlement of the amount in debt and legal surcharges, in the cases and terms provided for in this Code.

The creditor entities of the canons, taxes, or tariffs are competent for the application of the sanctions referred to in the preceding article.

Decisions that apply the sanctions established in number 1 may be challenged by means of an administrative action before the district court with jurisdiction in the area where the abstraction or discharge occurs, the hydraulic work is located, or the supply to which the canon, tax, or tariff refers is made.

Prior to resorting to judicial means, either of the parties may request the intervention of the Economic Regulator for the purpose of promoting a negotiated solution to the dispute.

Article 295

Surety in Case of Non-compliance

In situations of re-establishment of the water supply or sanitation service, following a suspension for contractual non-compliance by the consumers, the provision of a surety may be required from them.

The surety may be provided in cash, by bank transfer, or by means of a bank guarantee or surety insurance.

The value and the method of calculation of the sureties are established by the Economic Regulator, by a deliberation published in the Boletim Oficial.

No surety should be provided or it must be returned if, once the debt is regularized, the consumer opts for bank transfer as the form of payment of the tariffs, giving irrevocable written instructions to the bank to that effect.

In case of non-compliance, the supplier must, in the first place, use the value of the surety to satisfy the amounts in debt by the consumer.

The use of the surety does not prevent the supplier from exercising the right to suspend the supply, even if the amount of the surety is insufficient for the full settlement of the debt.

Once the surety is activated, the supplier may, in writing, require its reconstitution or reinforcement, in accordance with the rules established under the terms referred to in No. 3, within a period of not less than 10 (ten) days, under penalty of suspension of the supply.

The provided surety is considered valid until the termination or resolution of the supply contract, regardless of the entity providing the service.

Once the supply contract is terminated, by any of the legally or contractually permitted forms, the provided surety is returned to the consumer, deducted from the amounts of tariffs and legal surcharges and updated in relation to the date of its last alteration based on the annual consumer price index published by the National Institute of Statistics.

Article 296

Remission and Deferment

The holders of rights to use drinking water or of the sanitation service may request the remission or deferment of the payment of the respective taxes or tariffs in debt, on the grounds of an act of God or force majeure.

Article 297

Coercive Collection

The coercive collection of canons and taxes is carried out by means of tax execution.

The coercive collection of tariffs is carried out by means of civil process.

Article 298

Prior Intervention of the Economic Regulator

When the debtor is a public entity, prior to the coercive collection by common judicial means, the creditor entity of the tariffs in debt may request the intervention of the Economic Regulator, with a view to obtaining a negotiated solution to the dispute.

For the purposes of the provision of the preceding number, the creditor entity presents a written petition, in duplicate, identifying the debtor and indicating with precision its headquarters and contacts, alleging the supply, the invoicing, the non-payment, and the amount of the debt and interest for late payment, and requesting a conciliation attempt.

The petition must be instructed with documentary proof of the allegations, in duplicate.

The Economic Regulator must forward to the debtor entity the duplicates of the petition and of the documentary proof, for a written response within eight working days and, in the same act, summon the parties for a conciliation to take place within a period of ten to fifteen working days, under the presidency of one of its accredited representatives.

In the case of an entity without legal personality, the Ministry of Finance, when the entity is of the State, or the respective municipal chamber, when the entity is municipal, are also summoned to be represented at the conciliation attempt.

The parties may be accompanied or represented by a lawyer, under the terms of the law.

If the creditor entity or both parties fail to attend the conciliation attempt, a record of the non-realization of the conciliation attempt is drawn up and the process is archived.

If the debtor entity does not appear, a record of the non-realization of the conciliation attempt is drawn up and the representative of the Economic Regulator shall record therein the injunction for it to pay the debt claimed by the creditor entity.

If both parties appear and reach a conciliation, the representative of the Economic Regulator shall approve the agreement they have reached, in a record.

If both parties appear and do not reach a conciliation, the Economic Regulator, after analyzing the evidence produced and the record of the conciliation attempt, issues, within a period of 10 (ten) days, an opinion on the dispute, either ordering the archiving of the process if it understands that the debt does not exist or has been extinguished, or notifying the debtor entity to pay it, in whole or in part, if it understands the debt to be proven and its collection legal.

Article 299

Other Forms of Collection

When the debtor is a public entity, the creditor entity of overdue tariffs and legal surcharges may offset its credit, in whole or in part, with credits that the debtor entity has over it, under the terms of civil law.

When the debtor entity is entitled to receive non-earmarked funds from the State, the payment of the tariff debt and legal surcharges may be made directly by the State, by discount from the said funds, at the request of the creditor entity and in the face of any document that constitutes an enforceable title under the terms of the following article.

Article 300

Enforceable Titles

The following constitute enforceable titles for the coercive collection of tariffs in debt, in addition to those established in the laws of civil procedure:

a) The record of the conciliation attempt before the Economic Regulator, in the cases provided for in Nos. 8 and 9 of Article 298 or when it expressly contains the total or partial acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor entity;

b) The notification referred to in No. 10 of Article 298;

c) The original of the collection notice issued by the concessionaire or licensed entities;

d) Others as such considered by this Code.

CHAPTER VII

The determination of the fine and of the accessory sanctions is made as a function of the gravity of the administrative offense, the guilt of the agent, their economic situation, and the benefits obtained from the practice of the act, with the fine, whenever possible, having to exceed the economic benefit that the agent derived from the practice of the infraction.

In the determination of the applicable sanction, the prior and subsequent conduct of the agent and the requirements of prevention are also taken into account.

Coercion, falsification, false declarations, simulation, or other fraudulent means used by the agent, as well as the existence of acts of concealment or dissimulation tending to hinder the discovery of the infraction, are also considered.

Article 362

In addition to the fine, the following sanctions may be applied to the agents of water-related administrative offenses, under the terms of the law:

Article 363

Restoration of the Previous Situation

The body competent to apply the fine may also order the violator to proceed with the restoration of the situation prior to the infraction, specifically fixing the works or actions to be carried out and the deadline for their execution.

The restoration order is preceded by a hearing of the violator, who has 15 (fifteen) days from the date of their notification to express their views on the content of the same.

If the period referred to in the preceding number has elapsed without the restoration order being complied with, the competent body shall proceed with the necessary works and actions, at the violator's expense.

The documents that title the expenses incurred by force of the preceding number, when not voluntarily paid by the violator within a period of 20 (twenty) days from their notification, serve as an enforceable title.

Article 364

Recidivism

A person who commits a new infraction after having been convicted for a water-related administrative offense is punished as a recidivist.

The infraction for which the agent has been convicted is not relevant for the purposes of recidivism if the prescription period for the first has elapsed between the two infractions.

In case of recidivism, the minimum and maximum limits of the fine are raised by one-third of their respective value.

Article 365

Prescription Periods

The procedure for a water-related administrative offense only prescribes when 5 (five) years have elapsed since the practice of the administrative offense.

The execution for non-voluntary payment of a fine may be promoted in court directly by the service or entity to which the respective revenue reverts, through a legal representative.

Article 367

Decision

Once the instruction is concluded, if the administrative offense is not proven, the administrative authority shall archive the process.

If the administrative offense is proven, the administrative authority shall impose, with due justification, the fine and/or the accessory sanctions that are applicable, and must specify:

The appeal is formulated in a petition addressed to the judge of the competent Court and presented to the managing entity of the national water resources system, as the case may be, within a period of 8 (eight) days.

The period referred to in the preceding number is counted from the notification to the accused of the decision that applied the fine.

The petition for judicial appeal must contain the summary allegations of fact and of law, the respective conclusions, as well as an indication or joinder of all available means of proof that, demonstrably, it was not possible for them to present in the administrative instance.
