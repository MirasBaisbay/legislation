Act No. 81-13 of March 4, 1981, establishing the Water Code

**EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM**

Clearly, the issue of water is one of the Government's primary concerns, and it has been given priority in its successive economic and social development plans. During the Fifth Plan, approximately 60,000,000,000 Francs will be invested in the water sector to mitigate the uncertainties caused by drought, both in terms of meeting the water needs of the population and ensuring the proper management of our rural development projects, particularly for agriculture and livestock farming.

By 1990, 157,000,000,000 Francs will be allocated to similar projects, for the construction of equipped wells and boreholes as well as for the hydro-agricultural developments made possible by the large dams of the O.M.V.S. and the O.M.V.G., and those in Casamance.

It is also evident that any effort of this magnitude, at the risk of being irrational and unproductive, must be supported by an effective legislative and regulatory framework adapted to the specific characteristics of our country. This necessity, which the present Code addresses, was already affirmed by the inter-ministerial councils of February 19, 1973, and March 14, 1975.

To account for the various socio-economic and health aspects, the Code was developed in collaboration with all ministerial departments that participated in the working group convened for this purpose.

The legislative and regulatory texts in force concerning the subject matter have been largely taken into account. This includes, in particular, Act No. 65-59 of July 19, 1965, on the production, abstraction, transport, and distribution of water and electrical energy. The State Lands Code and the Urban Planning Code were also considered.

This draft bill is very largely inspired by the draft Water Code prepared by the Inter-State Committee for Hydraulic Studies, which includes almost all the countries of the sub-region that, like us, are faced with the structural scarcity of a resource as vital as water, and especially with the harsh reality of drought.

Given the complexity of the problem and the recommendations of the international community for the protection and preservation of water resources, assistance was sought from a United Nations expert specializing in water law.

Thanks to the contribution of this expert, our Code includes a set of provisions that the United Nations has established as fundamental principles for good water management, particularly in the areas of health and pollution control.

The most essential principle of all is that of the public domain status of water, which makes this resource a common good for all. It is on this basis that sound resource planning, proper management, and equitable distribution among different uses and according to each user's needs are founded, within the framework of strict respect for the general interest.

- 1 -

It is also on this principle that the Code's obligation to subject any exploitation of our water resources to prior authorization is based, regardless of the intended purpose, form, or means used.

The Code also emphasizes the health aspect, as it incorporates the standards defined by the World Health Organization, while adapting them to our level of development and the nature of our hydraulic works.

The public domain status of water explains the power conferred by the Code on agents responsible for water policing, who are competent to penalize any unregulated use, any waste, any act voluntarily causing the pollution of water resources, and all actions that run counter to the general interest.

This is the rationale of the present draft bill, which I submit for your approval.

The National Assembly deliberated and adopted this act in its session of February 16, 1981;

The President of the Republic promulgates the law, the text of which follows:

**Art. 7.** – The Ministers in charge of Water Resources and Sanitation shall ensure the conservation and management of water and hydraulic works. They shall receive applications and declarations and issue authorizations to use water resources.

The authorization system shall be established by decree issued upon the report of the Ministers in charge of Water Resources and Sanitation.

**Art. 8.** – The decree establishing the authorization system must, in addition to the provisions set forth in the articles below, reconcile the interests of the various categories of users, with due respect for previously established rights and customs and the preservation of the national water heritage.

**Art. 9.** – As of the date of entry into force of the present Code, any person wishing to:
- construct a groundwater abstraction facility by means of a well, borehole, or drainage gallery intended to yield more than 5 cubic meters per hour, or equip an existing abstraction facility, or draw from an aquifer classified as Zone I;
- construct a fixed or mobile abstraction facility in or over the bed of a watercourse;
must submit an application for authorization to the Ministers in charge of Water Resources and Sanitation.

**Art. 10.** – The population of the administrative district where the works are to be located shall be informed of the opening of an inquiry by means of public notice or any other means of publicity, at least 5 days in advance.

A personal authorization may not be transferred or assigned to third parties other than the heirs of the beneficiary, except by virtue of an authorization granted in the same form as the original authorization.

**Art. 15.** – However, an authorization to use water granted specifically and explicitly for an agricultural, livestock, industrial, or tourism operation is a real right that remains attached to that operation, regardless of who owns it.

**Art. 16.** – The abstraction of water is subject to the collection of a fee.

**Art. 17.** – The authorization may be suspended or the quantity of water reduced in accordance with the provisions of Title IV, Section I.
Such reduction or suspension shall not give rise to any compensation.

**Art. 18.** – Where several applications for authorization to abstract groundwater or surface water are in competition, the Ministers in charge of Water Resources and Sanitation shall decide based on the priorities defined in Title III, Section 5.

**Art. 20.** – Authorization is always granted subject to the rights of third parties.

**Art. 21.** – The authorization is precarious; it may be revoked by the Ministers in charge of Water Resources and Sanitation in the following cases:
1. If its withdrawal is necessitated by a reason of public interest, except in the case of public works for the purpose of using surface water, or a concession for water use, as defined in Article 28;
2. For non-compliance, after formal notice, with one of the conditions stipulated in the authorization, except in cases of *force majeure*.

In the first case, the revocation shall entitle the beneficiary, as compensation for the harm caused, to an indemnity fixed either by mutual agreement or by the competent courts.

The methods of assessment and collection are provided for in Title V, Section I.

**Art. 23.** – The deprivation of rights of use exercised over public domain waters by any farmer, livestock breeder, fish farmer, forester, industrialist, or other user shall give rise to an indemnity fixed by mutual agreement or by the courts.
Where the harm caused consists in the loss of motive power resulting from the creation of a plant, the indemnity may be awarded to the aggrieved beneficiary in the form of an energy supply.

**Section 2**
**Concessions for Use**

**Art. 24.** – Public service concessions for the exploitation of water for own needs may be granted to public establishments, national companies, mixed-economy companies, or private law legal persons benefiting from public financial support, or to third parties when their installation is of general interest.

**Article 43.** – The abstraction of surface water without a fixed or mobile installation is unrestricted, subject to the regulations applicable to the aquifer concerned.
Subject to the same reservation as above, the abstraction of surface water by a mobile installation for temporary needs is unrestricted up to the flow rate provided for in Article 42.
