The Council of State
In the name of the Republic

Number: 5852

CHAPTER I
ON THE DOMAIN OF RAINWATER.

Art. 1.- For the purposes of this law, rainwater is considered to be that which proceeds immediately from rainfall.

Art. 2.- Rainwater that falls on a property belongs to the owner of said property while it flows through it. Consequently, the owner may build, within their property, ponds, marshes, cisterns, or reservoirs to store it for that purpose, or use any other adequate means, provided that it does not cause harm to the public or to third parties.

Art. 3.- Rainwater that flows through ravines or dry riverbeds, whose channels are also in the public domain, is public property.

Art. 4.- The Secretariat of State for Agriculture, through the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, may grant authorization to those who request it to build cisterns or reservoirs on public lands to collect rainwater. For such purposes, the interested party must submit a plan of the works to be executed.

Art. 5.- The water collected in this manner shall be used by the executor of the works in the form and under the conditions determined by the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources. In any case, said Directorate may use any surplus that may result after the constructor's use for the benefit of interested third parties.

Art. 6.- The owners of properties adjoining public roads may utilize the verges of said roads.

Art. 7.- The owners of properties bordering public watercourses of non-continuous flow, such as dry riverbeds, ravines, and the like, which are in the public domain, may use for irrigation the rainwater that flows through them and may construct, for that purpose, earth and loose stone embankments or mobile or permanent dams, provided that this does not prejudice the pre-existing rights of downstream properties that had previously built dams for the use of said waters. For such works, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources shall be duly informed in advance to determine the priority of use.

Paragraph: The General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources may, in any case, construct dams within public domain lands to collect rainwater that flows through dry riverbeds, ravines, or discontinuous streams for the purpose of distribution among the needy property owners of the region.

Art. 8.- When these embankments or dams may cause floods or any other harm to the public, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, either ex officio or at the request of a party, upon verifying the danger, shall order the builder to modify them as necessary to dispel any fear, or if necessary, to destroy them. If they threaten to cause harm to private individuals, the latter may file a timely claim with the local authority, and if the harm occurs, their rights before the Courts of Justice shall be expedited.

Art. 9.- The provisions in the preceding articles regarding rainwater are applicable to the water from intermittent springs and streams that only flow in times of abundant rainfall.

Art. 10.- When the construction of permanent dams is intended for the purpose of utilizing rainwater or water from springs and streams for irrigation.

CHAPTER II
DOMAIN OF LIVE, SPRING, AND RUNNING WATERS.

Art. 11.- The waters of rivers, waters that rise continuously or discontinuously on public domain lands; continuous waters from springs and streams that run through their natural courses, constitute part of the public domain... and consequently, are considered available for distribution for agricultural or industrial purposes on any land on whose slope it is possible to practice the conveyance of water, in the form and under the conditions established in this Law.

Art. 12.- In the properties of private individuals, the waters that rise continuously or discontinuously therein belong to the owner for their use or enjoyment while they flow through the properties.

When the unused waters leave the property, they become public waters for the purposes of this Law. However, if after leaving the river where they originate, they naturally enter to flow through another private property, the owner of said property may use them, fulfilling the requirements demanded by the Law, as may the immediately downstream owner if there is one, and so on, with prior authorization from the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources.

Art. 13.- Any eventual use of water from springs and streams in natural channels may be freely maintained by the owners of downstream properties, provided they obtain the corresponding prior authorization from the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources.

1.- The properties through which the waters flow before their incorporation into the river, maintaining the order of their proximity to the source of the currents and respecting their right to eventual use along the entire length of each property.

2.- The properties fronting or adjoining the channel, in order of proximity to it and always preferring the upstream ones.

However, it is understood that in these downstream and lateral properties, whoever has anticipated the use cannot be deprived of it by another, even if the latter is situated further upstream in the course of the water. And no eventual use may interrupt or attack previously acquired rights to the same waters in a downstream region.

Art. 15.- Waters not used by the owner of the property where they originate, as well as any surplus from their uses, shall exit the property at the same point of the accustomed natural channel, and may not be diverted in any way from the course through which they originally flowed. The same is understood for immediately downstream properties in relation to the next, with this order always being observed.

Art. 16.- If the owner of a property where a natural spring has emerged does not use more than half, a third, or another fractional amount of its waters, the remaining surplus shall be used by the owners of inland properties in the manner determined in Article 7 of this Law.
.........those waters and consolidate through uninterrupted use of their right.

However, it is understood that in these downstream or lateral properties, the one who anticipates or had anticipated cannot be deprived of it by another, even if the latter were situated further upstream in the course of the water.

Art. 17.- The domain of mineral waters that rise or flow in lands of public or private property constitute part of the public domain and consequently are considered available for concession in accordance with the conditions determined by the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources. When granting a concession for these sources, the owner of the land where said source rises or flows will have priority under equal conditions.

For the purposes of this law, mineral waters are understood to be those that contain dissolved substances useful for industry in general, whatever their nature may be.

Art. 18.- Mineral-medicinal waters are considered public domain, and the State may grant concessions for their exploitation or direct exportation, regulating the same in both cases. When said sources rise on private lands, the State shall give priority to the owner of the same for their exploitation, in the event that it does not directly undertake the exploitation of said springs.

CHAPTER III
ON THE DOMAIN OF STILL OR STAGNANT WATERS.

Art. 19.- Lakes and lagoons formed by nature that occupy public lands or whose size constitutes sources of use for communities that can be utilized in irrigation systems, reservoir for aqueducts, or any other work of public utility are in the public domain.

Art. 20.- Lagoons and ponds formed on lands owned by private individuals, and which do not fall under the designation established in the preceding article, are the property of said individuals.

CHAPTER IV
ON THE DOMAIN OF SUBTERRANEAN WATERS.

Art. 21.- Subterranean waters obtained by means of ordinary wells, that is, wells for domestic purposes and for watering livestock, belong to the owner of a property in full ownership.

Art. 22.- Every property owner may freely open ordinary wells to carry water within their properties, even if this results in the diminishment of their neighbors' waters. However, the distance of meters between wells within towns and 15 meters in the countryside must be maintained between the new excavation and the permanent wells, ponds, springs, and aqueducts of the neighbors.

Art. 23.- The owner of any land may explore for and fully appropriate, by means of artesian wells, deep wells, and through tunnels and galleries, the waters that exist beneath the surface of their property, provided that they do not divert or separate public or private waters from their natural course.

Art. 24.- When, as a consequence of the works of an artesian well, deep well, tunnel, or gallery, public or private waters destined for a public service or a pre-existing private use, with legitimately acquired rights, are diverted or diminished, the officials of the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, as soon as it comes to their knowledge by any means, may suspend the works in progress.

Art. 25.- The works referred to in the preceding article for water exploration may not be executed at a distance of less than 40 meters from others' buildings, a railway, or a road, nor less than 100 meters from another water exploration site, spring, river, canal, aqueduct, or public watering place, without the corresponding license from the owners.

Art. 26.- Concessions of public domain lands for the exploration of subterranean waters by means of galleries, tunnels, artesian wells, or deep wells shall be granted by the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, with everything related to the domain, limitations of ownership, and use of the explored waters being subject to what this law prescribes with respect to these private matters.

Concessions for these subterranean explorations may only be granted on public domain lands whose surface or soil has not been granted for a different purpose, unless both are compatible.

No concession of this kind may prejudice pre-existing uses, whether of public interest or private, with legitimately acquired rights.

CHAPTER V
ON DEFENSE WORKS FOR PUBLIC WATERS.

Art. 27.- The owners of properties bordering public watercourses have the liberty to place defenses against the waters on their respective banks by means of plantations, dikes, revetments, walls, or any other work, provided they deem them convenient, giving timely notice thereof to the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources. Said Directorate may, however, after due process, order the suspension of such works and even the restoration of things to their former state, when due to such circumstances they threaten to cause prejudice to navigation or the floating of logs in rivers, divert the currents from their natural course, or produce floods.

Paragraph: When the defense works consist of simple walls erected within the scope of private property and longitudinally to the course of the river, no third party may allege prejudice as a consequence of said work, and therefore the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources may not order the destruction of said works.

Art. 28.- When plantations and any defense work that is intended are to invade the channel, they may not be executed without prior authorization from the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources.

Art. 29.- In channels where it is convenient to execute inexpensive dense works, the Director General of Hydraulic Resources shall grant a general authorization so that the owners of the bordering properties, each on the part of the channel bordering their respective bank, may construct them, but subject to the conditions set in the concession, aimed at preventing some owners from causing prejudice to others.

Art. 30.- When the projected works are of some consideration, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, at the request of those who promote them and after studying them, may oblige all the property owners who are to benefit from them to bear their cost, provided that the majority of them, computed by the share of property each one represents, gives their conformity and the common utility that the works are to produce appears fulfilled and factually justified. In such a case, each one shall contribute to the payment according to the benefits they receive.

Art. 31.- Whenever, in order to prevent or contain imminent floods, it is necessary in an emergency to carry out provisional works or to destroy existing ones on any class of properties, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources may order it.

Art. 32.- Works of general, provisional, or local interest necessary to defend populations and to keep navigable and floatable rivers channeled and clear shall be decided upon or paid for by the State.

The examination and study of post-projects related to this class of works corresponds to the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, which, through the corresponding Secretary of State, shall submit to the Executive Power the necessity of executing them.

Art. 33.- The lands and works that are necessary for the construction, expansion, or improvement of works for the use of public waters are declared of public utility, without prejudice to any indemnifications that may be appropriate, in accordance with the law.

TITLE II
ON SPECIAL USES OF PUBLIC WATERS

CHAPTER I
ON THE USE OF PUBLIC WATERS FOR FISH HATCHERIES AND FARMS.

Art. 34.- The General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, through the corresponding Secretariat of State, may grant concessions for the use of waters to form lakes, pools, or ponds intended for fish hatcheries or farms, provided that no harm is caused to public health or to any other downstream uses with previously acquired rights.

Art. 35.- For the industry referred to in the preceding article, the petitioner shall present the complete project of the works and the title proving ownership of the land where they are to be built or having obtained the consent of the owner.

Art. 36.- The concessionaires of public waters for irrigation or industrial establishments may, upon prior request for that purpose, form pools or ponds for fish hatcheries in their canals or on adjacent lands they have acquired.

Art. 37.- Authorizations for fish hatcheries shall be granted in perpetuity. However, it is understood that if the beneficiary does not make use of their permit within the period agreed upon by the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, or if they abandon the care and attention of the hatchery for more than 2 years, they shall forfeit their concession by full right.

CHAPTER II
ON THE USE OF PUBLIC WATERS FOR INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES.

Art. 38.- The waters of rivers may be used for the production of mechanical energy, directly or for the production of light and electrical power, and for industrial uses, provided that it does not cause the deviation of the waters from their natural course. In such cases, their establishment shall not hinder the free flow of the waters nor prejudice the bordering properties, irrigated lands, or established industries, including fishing.

Art. 39.- Any natural person............ studies for the use of public waters destined for industrial enterprises of public or private interest must first direct a request for authorization to the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources.

Paragraph: To the aforementioned request, the interested party or parties shall attach an explanatory report of the project, indicating the water source to be used, its available flow, and the purposes of the projected work.

Art. 40.- The right to use the waters of rivers for the purposes of Article 38 may be granted to private individuals or companies, Dominican or foreign, who request it from the Executive Power through the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, with the request containing an attachment for its study by the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, as follows:

a) The project of the works, composed of the plans, descriptive memory, budget of expenses, and technical and economic conditions in general;

b) The declaration to adhere to the stipulations of this Law.

Art. 41.- In both navigable and non-navigable rivers, the Executive Power shall grant the necessary authorization for the establishment of mills or other industrial plants in buildings located near houses, to which the necessary water is conducted through canals and which is then returned to the river's current. In no case shall this authorization be granted if it harms the navigation of the rivers and existing industrial establishments.

To obtain the authorization referred to in this article, it is an indispensable requirement that the person requesting it be the owner of the land where they intend to build the structure or be authorized for it by the owner.

Art. 42.- When an industrial establishment releases into the waters substances and properties harmful to health, vegetation, or the procreation and life of fish, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources shall have a technical inspection conducted, and if the harm is found to be true, it shall order the industrial work to be suspended until its owners adopt the appropriate remedy. The rights and expenses of the inspection shall be paid by the person who filed the complaint, if it is found to be unfounded, and otherwise by the owner of the establishment.

When the owner or owners, within a period of six months, have not adopted the appropriate remedy, it shall be understood that they renounce continuing the exploitation of their industry.

Art. 43.- Concessions for the use of public waters for industrial purposes shall be granted in perpetuity and on the condition that if at any time the waters acquire properties harmful to health, vegetation, or fish, the concession shall be forfeited by right without any right to compensation.

Art. 45.- Concessions for industrial purposes shall be granted by means of contracts celebrated by the Executive Power, requested through the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, which shall be in charge of examining the plans and projects provided for in the indicated law. In said contracts, post-payments shall be stipulated that the concessionaire must make to the Treasury for the use of the waters, according to the importance of the concessions and taking into account the information contained in the preceding article.

Art. 46.- Small-scale coffee growers who use water for washing the coffee from their production are exempted from the prescriptions of this article, when the quantity, solely and exclusively necessary, is for a depulping machine moved by muscular force or hydraulic power. They shall only pay a basic tax for each contract and one peso annually for the effective use of the waters.

Art. 47.- Private individuals who wish to use public waters must first provide themselves with a title.... And fulfill, at the time of effective use, the other requirements established in this law.

Art. 48.- Every application for water titles, whether for agricultural or industrial uses, must be addressed to the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, accompanied by a plan of the land. In said plan, the parcels that constitute the land shall be indicated, if it is registered; otherwise, all the boundaries of the land shall be indicated, in order to determine the extent and the settlement.

Paragraph: The right of priority is established in the applications for water titles. This priority shall not be effective, however, when the requested waters may be of interest to the Government for use in national irrigation or other purposes of public interest.

Art. 49.- Applications for water titles must be made on the forms prepared for that purpose by the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources and must be signed by the owner of the land.

Paragraph: The tenants of lands may also apply for water titles, when they are authorized by the owner of the land, with the understanding that if the water titles are granted, they will constitute a right inherent to the land and not to the tenant.

Art. 50.- When the quantity requested for a water title exceeds fifty liters per second, the application must be accompanied by a general plan and details of the work by grid, on a scale of 1 to 2000, design of sections, corresponding calculations, and descriptive memories.

The General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources may grant water titles for quantities less than those requested, when the flow of the source so requires, in order to make its distribution equitable.

Likewise, said Directorate may grant water titles to be used solely and exclusively in the semi-arid regions dedicated to pastures and other crops; for which purpose the Directorate shall arrange for the study of the rivers from the point of view of the best regime and the gauging of their currents, in order to determine the amount of water available in the different seasons of the year.

Art. 52.- The water rights obtained through the concession of a title shall form an inseparable part of the corresponding property. These rights shall consist of the faculty to use waters for the purposes indicated in the titles, but with the obligation, on the part of the holder, to request annual permits for the effective use of the waters, fulfilling the requirements of the Law.

Paragraph: However, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources may authorize, after a technical report proving its justification, the transfer of water titles from one land to another, in which case the title shall form an inseparable part of the new land.

Art. 53.- In all titles for the use of public waters, their nature, the quantity of liters per second of the granted water, and if it were for irrigation, the extent in hectares of the land to be irrigated, shall be specified.

Art. 54.- The quantity of one liter per second per hectare is designated as the unit of water for distribution purposes.

Paragraph: The General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources shall determine for each case the respective irrigation allocation, taking into account the physical constitution of the land and the class of crops.

Art. 55.- The waters granted for one use may not be dedicated to another diverse use without the formation of a file, as if it were a new concession; it being provided, however, that the waters granted for irrigation may also be applied in the industrial preparation of the products of the irrigated property itself, provided that the number of liters granted is not increased, and that the waters granted to move machinery and which must therefore be returned to the channel, may also be used for any other industrial purposes that do not utilize them in a way that prevents their return to the channel.

Art. 56.- The General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources and consequently the corresponding Secretariat of State shall not be responsible for any lack or decrease that may result in the flow expressed in the title, whether it proceeds from an error or any other cause.

Art. 57.- Whenever in the concessions, the water titles, and in the enjoyment of determined quantities of water for a fixed period of time, nothing else is expressed, continuous use is understood to be at all times; if it is by day, the natural day shall be understood as 24 hours from midnight; if it is during the day or the night, it shall be understood as between sunrise and sunset; and if it is by week, it shall be counted from 12 o'clock on Sunday night; if it is for festive days or with their exclusion, it shall be understood to be those of precept on which one cannot work, with only those days that were such at the time of the concession or contract being considered festive. The application of these provisions and the details regarding the manner and time of water enjoyment are the responsibility of the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, which shall put them into practice through its officials.

Art. 58.- Concessions for the use of waters shall lapse for failure to comply with the conditions and terms in accordance with which they were granted.

CHAPTER II
ON THE APPLICATION FOR PERMITS FOR THE USE OF WATERS.

Art. 59.- For the construction of canals, ponds for fish hatcheries and farms, industrial facilities, as well as to effectively use the waters, the holders of water titles must request and obtain permits from the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources.

Paragraph: Applications for the use of waters may also be made by the tenants or users of the lands in any form, provided that the lands are covered by water titles.

Art. 60.- From November 1 to 30 of each year, all holders of water titles or the tenants or users who have obtained permits for the effective use of the waters must renew their permits. Both the applications for use and for renewal shall be addressed to the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, which shall prepare said Directorate for this purpose.

Paragraph: Excluded from the annual renewal for colonization of the waters are industrial exploitations that will be governed by the special contracts signed with the Executive Power, as well as persons or companies that use said waters in ponds for fish hatcheries, which will be subject to an annual fee determined in the concession, and those that use rainwater and non-continuous waters, which due to their scarcity only permit the irrigation of pastures.

Art. 61.- The following tariffs are established for applications for water titles, for permits for the construction of private canals, and for the use of waters.

1.- Applications for water titles:

 2.50. If the user dedicates the plot to rice cultivation, they shall pay double the tariff.

Paragraph I: In irrigation sites where the system of measurement by liters cannot be applied, one liter per second per hectare shall be considered for current irrigation and liters per second per hectare for rice irrigation.

In cases of irrigation by flooding, the water shall be used at a rate of two liters per second per hectare, and for the irrigation of minor fruits, it shall be used at a rate of one liter per second per hectare.

The preceding tariff shall also apply to lands irrigated by privately constructed canals or those to be constructed in the country. When there are different tariffs to be paid, payment shall be made according to the highest, on each plot.

Paragraph II: State credit institutions shall not grant loans on a portion of land or on crops that are fostered with the use of irrigation water, if they are not presented, prior to the concession of the credit and in each case, the corresponding annual permit for the use of the waters.

Paragraph III: (Modified by Art. 2 of Law 281, of June 29, 1966, published in the Official Gazette No. 8992, of June 29, 1966): In the absence of payment at its due date, the tariffs shall be increased by 2% per month up to a maximum of 20%. Irrigators in default shall lose the benefit of the waters for the next irrigation period if they have not satisfied the previous payment.

Paragraph IV: The rates and surcharges provided for in this Law shall be paid in cash at the Collectorates of Internal Revenue and National Assets of the respective jurisdictions or at the Municipal Treasuries where no Collectorates exist. The corresponding receipts shall be attached to the applications addressed to the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources.

Important Note: This paragraph has been tacitly repealed by internal provisions of the National Institute of Hydraulic Resources, based on Article 6 of Law No. 6 of its creation, which provides that "INDRHI shall have as financial resources, the contributions from the accounts payable by the beneficiaries of the works within its attributions," and by Article 29 of the same Law, which provides that "This Law repeals any Law or part of a Law that is contrary to it." INDRHI has arranged for the fees to be paid at its own offices, because if such payments were made at the Collectorates of Internal Revenue or at the Municipal Treasuries, these funds would automatically swell the treasury, consequently preventing the construction of one of INDRHI's financing resources.

Art. 62.- Ranchers, breeders, and cattlemen in general who have animals on lands where there are State canals or aqueducts may use their waters for the needs of their livestock, free from the payment of any fee, tax, or contribution.

Art. 63.- The use shall be equitable among the interests, and for this purpose, the Executive Power shall have the capacity to regulate it by means of regulations or administrative inspections directed at the authorities of the State canals and aqueducts.

Art. 64.- Every permit for the use of water entails the obligation on the part of the user to whom it is granted to make use of the quota that the permit determines. In all cases that are not due to fortuitous causes or force majeure in which the user does not make use, for a period of two years, of the total or partial amount stated in their permit, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources may grant it to whoever requests it. No exemptions from payment will be granted for lack of use of the waters.

Art. 65.- When the flow of the source so requires, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources may regulate the use of the waters in turns among the persons who hold the corresponding water titles.

Paragraph: The provision of the preceding article regarding the organization of turns shall not be taken into account for the purposes of payment of the fee for the use of public waters.

Art. 66.- In the general interest of the best use of the waters, the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources shall arrange for the recognition of existing rivers and irrigation canals, with the aim of ensuring that no irrigator wastes the water of their allocation that could serve another in need of it, and to prevent torrential waters from precipitating unproductively and even harmfully into the sea, when other regions desire and request them for irrigation and seasonal use, without prejudice to acquired rights.

CHAPTER III
ON IRRIGATION DISTRICTS

Art. 67.- An Irrigation District constitutes the area of land that includes the distribution of water by means of canals constructed at the expense of the State or constructed on account of landowners interested in the irrigation works and whose limits shall be fixed by decree of the Executive Power.

Art. 68.- The Public Administration shall gradually organize Irrigation Districts, as the needs of each region of the country demand, upon prior recommendation made to the Executive Power by the General Directorate of Hydraulic Resources, through the corresponding Secretariat of State.

Art. 69.- The establishment of a land area as an Irrigation District entails by full right the official direction and irrigation in said area.

Art. 70.- In cases where the State constructs irrigation works at its own cost, these shall be paid for by the owners of the benefited lands in proportion to the amount of water that said owners are able to use at the time of the construction of the work or subsequently.

Paragraph I: (Modified by Law No. 436, of October 10, 1964, published in O.G. No. 8897, of October 10, 1964). The owners of lands who use or are able to use the waters of a canal constructed by the State shall pay the quotas of their lands solely and exclusively in kind, in the following form:

a) 25% of their irrigable lands, when their crops are for human sustenance;

b) 35% of their irrigable lands when these are cultivated with pastures, that is, for animal feed;

c) 50% of their irrigable lands when these are cultivated with pastures, that is, for animal feed;

d) When the extent of a parcel, upon calculating its quota share, results in an area of less than 60 tareas, the owner shall be exempt from the payment of their quota share, provided it is proven that they only own that property, with the object of avoiding smallholdings (minifundio), which is contrary to the principles of the Agrarian Reform.
