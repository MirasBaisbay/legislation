SECTION II - COMPULSORY EASEMENTS SUBSECTION I - AQUEDUCT EASEMENT Article 80 An aqueduct easement is the right to conduct waters that one is entitled to use across the lands of others. In an aqueduct easement, the dominant estate is that to which the waters are destined or from which they are discharged, drained, or flowed; the servient estate is that which must tolerate the passage of waters through it for the benefit of another property.

The owner of the servient estate shall have the right to be paid compensation in accordance with the provisions of Article 85; but if the easement was established by title, the will of those who agreed to it or of the one who granted it shall prevail, as the
https://www.impo.com.uy/bases/codigo-aguas/14859-1978 29/78 7/19/22, 12:21 PM Water Code cases may be.

(*) (*) Notes: See in this code, articles: 85, 114, and 203 (entry into force).

References to the article Article 84 The aqueduct easement implies the right to route it along a path that allows for the free descent of the waters, and that, due to the nature or features of the ground, does not make the work excessively expensive. Once these conditions are met, the aqueduct shall be routed along the path that causes the least damage to the servient estate. The shortest route shall be considered the least prejudicial to the latter and the least costly for the beneficiary of the easement, unless the contrary is proven. The Judge shall, as far as possible, reconcile the interests of the parties; and, in doubtful points, shall decide in favor of the servient estates. (*)

If the characteristics of the work require a larger lateral space, the parties shall fix it, and if they do not agree, the Judge shall do so. The price of the occupied land and the compensation for damages must be paid before starting the construction of the aqueduct. When the easement is demanded with urgency, and this circumstance is summarily justified, the Judge must provisionally impose the easement, upon a bond provided by the plaintiff for the sum at which the Judge prudently estimates the damages and the cost of restoring things to their previous state, in case the action is dismissed.
