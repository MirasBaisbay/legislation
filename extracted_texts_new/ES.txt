**CONSOLIDATED TEXT**
**Last modified: December 28, 2023**

With respect to the industrial activities included in the scope of application of Law 16/2002, of July 1, on integrated pollution prevention and control, the provisions established in relation to the procedures for application, granting, review, and compliance with authorizations for discharges into the continental waters of intra-community basins regulated in this Consolidated Text are repealed, as established by the sole repealing provision. 2 of the aforementioned Law 16/2002, of July 1. Ref. BOE-A-2002-12995

The second final provision of Law 46/1999, of December 13, amending Law 29/1985, of August 2, on Water, in the version given by Law 6/2001, of May 8, on Environmental Impact Assessment, authorizes the Government to, within a period of two years from its entry into force, issue a Royal Legislative Decree that consolidates and adapts the existing legal regulations on water matters.

To this end, it is necessary to incorporate the modifications introduced into the text of the Water Law by Law 46/1999 itself, cited above, and by the judgment of the Constitutional Court 227/1988, of November 29, in which both the appeals of unconstitutionality filed against the Water Law and the positive conflict of powers raised against certain precepts of the Regulation of the Public Hydraulic Domain are partially upheld; by the additional provision 9.2 of Law 42/1994, of December 30, on fiscal, administrative and social order measures, which amends paragraphs 1, second subparagraph, and 2 of article 109 of the Water Law regarding sanctions; by articles 2 and 3 of Law 9/1996, of January 15, which adopts extraordinary, exceptional and urgent measures regarding hydraulic supplies as a consequence of the persistent drought, modifying and extending respectively articles 63 and 109.2 of the Water Law; by articles 158, 173 and 174 of Law 13/1996, of December 30, on fiscal, administrative and social order measures, relating to the direct management of the construction or exploitation of certain public works, to the legal regime of the concession contract for the construction and exploitation of hydraulic works, as well as to the amendment of article 21 of the Water Law, to which a new paragraph is added; and, finally, by Law 11/1999, of April 21, amending Law 7/1985, of April 2, regulating the Bases of the Local Regime, and other measures for the development of Local Government in matters of traffic, circulation of motor vehicles, road safety and in matters of water, which modifies and extends, respectively, articles 17 and 25 of the Water Law, relating to the National Water Council and the composition of the Governing Board of the River Basin Authorities.

On the other hand, and despite its legal rank, it has not been considered appropriate to include in the consolidated text Royal Decree-Law 11/1995, of December 28, which establishes the rules applicable to the treatment of urban wastewater. This regulation complements the provisions of the Water Law in relation to discharges, but it undoubtedly has other objectives and affects other different legislative areas, as is the case with maritime waters regulated by the Coasts Law. Therefore, without prejudice to its validity and application, it is understood that its inclusion in the consolidated text of the Water Law would cause significant dysfunctions from the point of view of legislative technique.

Consequently, a consolidated text of the Water Law has been prepared, which is incorporated into this Royal Legislative Decree and whose purpose, in compliance with the legal mandate, is to include the modifications that have been detailed.

By virtue of the foregoing, at the proposal of the Minister of the Environment, in agreement with the Council of State and after deliberation by the Council of Ministers at its meeting on July 20, 2001,

I HEREBY DECREE:

**Sole article.**

The consolidated text of the Water Law, which is inserted below, is approved.

**Sole repealing provision.**

All provisions of equal or lower rank that oppose this Royal Legislative Decree and the consolidated text it approves are repealed, and in particular, the following:

1.  Law 29/1985, of August 2, on Water.
2.  Law 46/1999, of December 13, which amends Law 29/1985, of August 2, on Water, except for the first additional provision.
3.  The additional provision 9, paragraph 2, of Law 42/1994, of December 30, on Fiscal, Administrative and Social Order Measures, which amends paragraphs 1, second subparagraph, and 2 of article 109 of the Water Law of 1985, regarding sanctions.
4.  Articles 2 and 3 of Law 9/1996, of January 15, which adopts extraordinary, exceptional and urgent measures regarding hydraulic supplies as a consequence of the persistent drought, modifying and extending, respectively, articles 63 and 109.2 of Law 29/1985.
5.  Paragraph 5 of article 158 and articles 173 and 174 of Law 13/1996, of December 30, on Fiscal, Administrative and Social Order Measures, relating to the direct management of the construction and/or exploitation of certain public works, to the legal regime of the concession contract for the construction and exploitation of hydraulic works, as well as to the amendment of article 21 of Law 29/11985, to which a new paragraph is added.
6.  Article 3 of Law 11/1999, of April 21, amending Law 7/1985, of April 2, regulating the Bases of the Local Regime, and other measures for the development of the Local Government in matters of traffic, circulation of motor vehicles, road safety and in matters of water, which modifies and extends, respectively, articles 17 and 25 of Law 29/1985, on Water.

**Sole final provision.**

This Royal Legislative Decree and the consolidated text it approves shall enter into force on the day following their publication in the "Official State Gazette".

Given in Palma de Mallorca on July 20, 2001.

The bed or natural channel of a continuous or discontinuous watercourse is the land covered by water during the maximum ordinary floods.

**Article 5. Channels of private domain.**

1.  Channels through which rainwater occasionally flows are of private domain as long as they cross, from their origin, only properties of private domain.
2.  The private ownership of these channels does not authorize carrying out work or constructing structures in them that may alter the natural course of the waters or degrade their quality to the detriment of the public interest or of a third party, or whose destruction by the force of floods may cause damage to persons or property.

**Article 6. Definition of banks.**

1.  Banks are understood as the lateral strips of public channels situated above the low-water level, and margins as the lands bordering the channels.
    The margins are subject, throughout their longitudinal extension:

    a) To an easement zone of five meters in width, for public use, which shall be regulated by regulation.
    b) To a police zone of 100 meters in width in which land use and activities carried out will be conditioned.
2.  In areas near the mouth of the sea, in the immediate surroundings of reservoirs, or when the topographic or hydrographic conditions of the channels and margins make it necessary for the safety of people and property, the width of both zones may be modified in the manner determined by regulation.

**Article 7. Protection works on the margins.**

Provisional protection works may be carried out on the margins of channels in case of urgent need. The owners who have constructed said works shall be responsible for any eventual damages that may derive from them.

1.  The bed or bottom of lakes and lagoons is the land that their waters occupy during the periods in which they reach their highest ordinary level.
2.  The bed or bottom of a surface reservoir is the land covered by the waters when they reach their highest level as a consequence of the maximum ordinary floods of the rivers that feed it.

**Article 10. Ponds located on private property.**

Ponds located on private property shall be considered an integral part of them, provided they are intended for the exclusive service of said properties and without prejudice to the application of the corresponding environmental legislation.

**Article 11. Flood-prone areas.**

1.  Lands that may be flooded during non-ordinary floods of lakes, lagoons, reservoirs, rivers, or streams shall retain the legal classification and ownership they had.
2.  River Basin Authorities shall forward to the competent Administrations for territorial and urban planning the available data and studies on floods, so that they are taken into account in land planning and, in particular, in the authorizations for land uses agreed upon in flood-prone areas.
3.  The Government, by Royal Decree, may establish the limitations on the use of flood-prone areas that it deems necessary to guarantee the safety of people and property. The Governing Councils of the Autonomous Communities may also establish complementary rules for said regulation.

**CHAPTER IV**
**On aquifers**

**Article 12. The public domain of aquifers.**

The public domain of aquifers or geological formations through which groundwater flows is understood to be without prejudice to the fact that the owner of the land may carry out any work that is not for the purpose of extracting or using the water, nor disturbs its regime or deteriorates its quality, with the exception provided for in paragraph 2 of article 54.

**CHAPTER V**
**On waters originating from desalination**

**Article 13. On desalination, concept, and requirements.**

1.  In general, the activity of desalination of seawater or brackish water is subject to the general regime established in this Law for the private use of the public hydraulic domain, without prejudice to the public domain authorizations and concessions that may be required in accordance with Law 22/1988, of July 28, on Coasts, and any others that may apply under the applicable sectoral legislation.
2.  Desalination works and facilities declared to be of general interest to the State may be operated directly by the bodies of the Ministry of the Environment, by the Hydrographic Confederations, or by the state-owned companies referred to in Chapter II of Title VIII of this Law. Likewise, in accordance with the provisions of article 125, user communities or central user boards may, by subscribing to a specific agreement with the aforementioned entities, be direct beneficiaries of the desalination works and facilities that affect them.
3.  Concessions for desalinated water shall be granted by the General State Administration in the event that said waters are intended for use in an inter-community river basin district.
    In the event that the specific agreement referred to in the last subsection of paragraph 2 has been signed, concessions for desalinated water may be granted directly to the user communities or central user boards.
4.  In the manner determined by regulation, the authorizations and concessions that must be granted by two or more bodies or public organizations of the General State Administration shall be processed in a single file.
5.  In the event that the use is not to be direct and exclusive to the concessionaire, the granting Administration shall approve the maximum and minimum values of the tariffs, which must incorporate the amortization quotas for the works.
6.  The concessionaires of the desalination activity and of desalinated waters who have their rights registered in the Water Register may participate in the operations of the water use rights exchange centers referred to in article 71 of this Law.

**TITLE II**

2.  The members of the governing and administrative bodies of the river basin authorities have the right to obtain all available information in the respective authority on matters within the competence of the bodies of which they are part.

**Article 16. Definition of a river basin.**

For the purposes of this law, a river basin is understood to be the surface of land whose surface runoff flows in its entirety through a series of streams, rivers and eventually lakes towards the sea through a single mouth, estuary or delta. The river basin as a unit of resource management is considered indivisible.

**Article 16 bis. River basin district.**

1.  A river basin district is understood to be the land and sea area composed of one or more neighboring river basins and the transitional, groundwater and coastal waters associated with those basins.
    Transitional waters are bodies of surface water in the vicinity of river mouths which are partly saline in character as a result of their proximity to coastal waters but which are substantially influenced by freshwater flows.
    Coastal waters are surface waters on the landward side of a line every point of which is at a distance of one nautical mile on the seaward side from the nearest point of the baseline from which the breadth of territorial waters is measured, extending, where appropriate, up to the outer limit of transitional waters.
2.  Coastal waters shall be specified and included in the nearest or most appropriate river basin district or districts.
3.  Aquifers that do not fully correspond to any particular district shall be included in the nearest or most appropriate district, with the part of the aquifer corresponding to its respective territorial scope being attributable to each of the districts, and in this case, coordinated management must be guaranteed through appropriate notifications between the affected districts.
4.  The river basin district, as the main unit for the purpose of basin management, constitutes the spatial area to which the water protection rules contemplated in this law apply, without prejudice to the specific protection regime for the marine environment that the State may establish.
5.  The Government, by royal decree, after hearing the autonomous communities, shall establish the territorial scope of each river basin district, which shall coincide with that of its hydrological plan.

**Article 17. Functions of the State in relation to the public hydraulic domain.**

In relation to the public hydraulic domain and within the framework of the powers attributed to it by the Constitution, the State shall exercise, in particular, the following functions:

a) Hydrological planning and the implementation of state plans for hydraulic infrastructures or any other state plan that forms part of them.
b) The adoption of the necessary measures for the fulfillment of international agreements and conventions on water matters.
c) The granting of concessions referring to the public hydraulic domain in river basins that extend beyond the territorial scope of a single Autonomous Community.
d) The granting of authorizations referring to the public hydraulic domain, as well as its protection, in river basins that extend beyond the territorial scope of a single Autonomous Community. The processing of these may, however, be entrusted to the Autonomous Communities.

**Article 18. Basic legal framework applicable to the Autonomous Communities.**

1.  The Autonomous Community which, by virtue of its Statute of Autonomy, exercises competence over the public hydraulic domain in river basins located entirely within its territory, shall adjust the legal framework of its water administration to the following bases:

    a) Application of the principles established in Article 14 of this Law.
    b) The representation of users in the collegiate bodies of the water administration shall not be less than one-third of the members that comprise them.
2.  Acts and agreements that infringe the State's water legislation or do not conform to hydrological planning and affect its competence in water matters may be challenged before the contentious-administrative jurisdiction.

**CHAPTER II**
**On the National Water Council**

**Article 19. The National Water Council.**

1.  The National Water Council is the highest advisory and participatory body in the matter.
2.  The following are part of the National Water Council:
    -   The General State Administration.
    -   The Autonomous Communities.
    -   Local Authorities through the state-level association with the largest presence.
    -   The River Basin Authorities.
    -   The most representative professional and economic organizations at the state level related to the different uses of water.
    -   The most representative trade union and business organizations at the state level.
    -   Non-profit entities at the state level whose purpose is the defense of environmental interests.
3.  The presidency of the National Water Council shall be held by the head of the Ministry of the Environment.
4.  Its composition and organic structure shall be determined by Royal Decree.

**Article 20. Matters subject to a mandatory report from the National Water Council.**

1.  The National Water Council shall issue a mandatory report on:

    a) The draft of the National Hydrological Plan, before its approval by the Government for submission to the Parliament (Cortes).
    b) The river basin hydrological plans, before their approval by the Government.
    c) Drafts of general provisions applicable throughout the national territory relating to the protection of waters and the regulation of the public hydraulic domain.
    d) Plans and projects of general interest for agricultural, urban, industrial and energy development or for territorial planning, insofar as they substantially affect hydrological planning or water uses.
    e) Issues common to two or more river basin authorities in relation to the use of water resources and other assets of the public hydraulic domain.
2.  Likewise, it shall issue a report on all those matters related to the public hydraulic domain that may be submitted to it for consultation by the Government or by the senior executive bodies of the Autonomous Communities.

e) surface water body: a discrete and significant element of surface water such as a lake, a reservoir, a stream, river or canal, part of a stream, river or canal, transitional waters or a stretch of coastal water.
f) groundwater body: a distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or aquifers.
g) artificial water body: a body of surface water created by human activity.
h) heavily modified water body: a body of surface water which, as a result of physical alterations by human activity, has undergone a substantial change in its nature.
i) water-related services: all activities related to the management of waters that enable their use, such as the abstraction, storage, conduction, treatment, and distribution of surface or groundwater, as well as the collection and treatment of wastewater, which is subsequently discharged into surface waters. Likewise, activities derived from the protection of people and property against floods shall be understood as services.

    a) The hydraulic works contemplated in section 1 in which the circumstances provided therein do not concur, at the request of the Autonomous Community in whose territory they are located, when due to their dimensions or economic cost they have a strategic relationship in the integral management of the river basin.
    b) The works necessary for the execution of national plans, other than hydrological plans, but which are related to them, provided that the same plan attributes the responsibility for the works to the General State Administration, at the request of the Autonomous Community in whose territory they are located.
4.  The declaration as hydraulic works of general interest of the infrastructures necessary for the transfer of resources, as referred to in paragraph c), section 1 of Article 45 of this Law, may only be carried out by the legal norm that approves or modifies the National Hydrological Plan.
5.  Prior to the declaration of general interest of a hydraulic work, a report must be prepared that justifies its economic, technical, social, and environmental viability, including a specific study on the recovery of costs. The same report shall be prepared prior to the execution of the works of general interest provided for in sections 1, 2, and 3.
    In both cases, the reports must be revised every six years if the works have not been carried out. The reports and their periodic revisions shall be made public.

**TITLE IV**
**On the utilization of the public hydraulic domain**

**CHAPTER I**
**Legal easements**

**Article 47. Obligations of lower-lying properties.**

1.  Lower-lying properties are subject to receiving the waters that naturally and without the work of man descend from higher-lying properties, as well as the earth or stone that they carry in their course. Neither the owner of the lower-lying property can do works that impede this easement nor the owner of the higher-lying property can do works that aggravate it.
2.  If the waters were the product of abstraction, surplus from other uses, or if their spontaneous quality had been artificially altered, the owner of the lower-lying property may oppose their reception, with the right to demand compensation for damages and losses, if the corresponding easement does not exist.

**Article 48. Legal regime of the aqueduct easement.**

1.  The river basin authorities may impose, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code and the Regulations of this Law, the forced easement of aqueduct, if the use of the resource or its evacuation so requires.
2.  In accordance with the same rules, the river basin authorities may impose the easements of water abstraction and watering place, of dam abutment and of stop or divider, as well as those of passage, when it is a matter of guaranteeing access or facilitating it to a public domain area of the channels, for specific uses, including sports and recreational uses, and, in general, as many easements as are provided for in the Civil Code.
3.  The file for the constitution of the easement shall reduce, as far as possible, the burden that it implies on the servient property.
4.  The variation of the circumstances that gave rise to the constitution of an easement shall give rise, at the request of a party, to the corresponding review file, which shall follow the same regulatory procedures as those provided for its constitution.
5.  The beneficiary of a forced easement must compensate for the damages and losses caused to the servient property in accordance with the current legislation.

**Article 49. Ownership of the elements of the easement.**

In any ditch or aqueduct, the channel, the side walls, and the margins shall be considered an integral part of the estate or building to which the waters are destined or, in case of evacuation, from which they proceed.

**CHAPTER II**
**On common and private uses**

**Article 50. Common uses.**

1.  Everyone may, without the need for administrative authorization and in accordance with the provisions of the Laws and Regulations, use surface waters, while they flow through their natural channels, for drinking, bathing, and other domestic uses, as well as for watering livestock.
2.  These common uses must be carried out in such a way that the quality and flow of the waters are not altered. In the case of waters that circulate through artificial channels, they will also have the limitations derived from the protection of the aqueduct. In no case may the waters be diverted from their channels or beds, and the normal regime of use must be respected.
3.  The protection, use, and exploitation of fishing resources in continental waters, as well as aquaculture and fish farming, shall be regulated by the general legislation of the environment and, where appropriate, by its specific legislation.
4.  The Law does not protect the abuse of rights in the use of water nor the waste or misuse thereof, whatever the title alleged.

**Article 51. Special common uses subject to a responsible declaration.**

1.  The exercise of the following special common uses shall require a prior responsible declaration:

    a) Navigation and flotation.
    b) The establishment of ferry boats and their landing stages.
    c) Any other use, not included in the previous article, that does not exclude the use of the resource by third parties.
2.  The responsible declaration, to which Article 3.9 of Law 17/2009, of November 23, on free access to service activities and their exercise, refers, must be submitted at least fifteen days in advance, so that the compatibility of said uses with the purposes of the public hydraulic domain can be verified.

**Article 52. Ways to acquire the right to private use.**

1.  The right to private use, whether consumptive or not, of the public hydraulic domain is acquired by legal provision or by administrative concession.
2.  The right to private use of the public hydraulic domain cannot be acquired by prescription.

**Article 53. Extinction of the right to private use.**

1.  The right to private use of waters, whatever the title of its acquisition, is extinguished:

    a) By the expiration of the term of its concession.
    b) By the forfeiture of the concession under the terms provided in Article 66.
    c) By forced expropriation.
    d) By express waiver of the concessionaire.
2.  The declaration of the extinction of the right to private use of water shall require a prior hearing of the titleholders.
3.  When the destination given to the granted waters was for irrigation or population supply, the holder of the concession may obtain a new one with the same use and destination for the waters, and must formulate the request in the prior hearing procedure in the extinction declaration file or during the last five years of its validity.
    The novation of water concessions granted to nuclear power plants will also be admitted so that these concessions cover the period of validity of the exploitation authorizations and the decommissioning authorizations of the plants until the issuance of the corresponding closure declarations, without exceeding the maximum period established in article 59.4.
    If the request is made, the hydrological planning office of the river basin authority must issue a report on its compatibility with the hydrological planning. Once its compatibility is accredited, the processing of the file will continue, excluding the procedure of competing projects.
4.  Upon the extinction of the concessionary right, all works that have been built within the public hydraulic domain for the exploitation of the use shall revert to the competent Administration free of charge and free of encumbrances, without prejudice to compliance with the conditions stipulated in the concessionary document.
5.  Rights acquired by legal provision shall be lost as established in the rule that regulates them or, failing that, by a regulatory provision of the same rank.
6.  The validity of the contracts for the assignment of water use rights referred to in Article 67 shall be that established by the parties in said contracts. In any case, the extinction of the right to private use of the assignor shall automatically imply the termination of the assignment contract.

**Article 54. Private uses by legal provision.**

1.  The owner of an estate may use the rainwater that runs through it and the stagnant water, within its boundaries, with no other limitations than those established in this Law and those derived from respect for the rights of third parties and the prohibition of the abuse of rights.
2.  Under the conditions established by regulation, water from springs located within a property may be used and groundwater may be exploited therein, when the total annual volume does not exceed 7,000 cubic meters. In aquifers that have been declared overexploited, or at risk of being so, new works covered by this section may not be carried out without the corresponding authorization.

**Article 55. Powers of the river basin authority in relation to the use and control of granted flows.**

1.  The river basin authority, when the availability of the resource so requires, may establish the operating regime for the reservoirs established in the rivers and for the groundwater aquifers, a regime to which the coordinated use of existing exploitations must adapt. Likewise, it may establish the joint operating regime for surface waters and groundwater aquifers.
2.  On a temporary basis, it may also condition or limit the use of the public hydraulic domain to guarantee its rational exploitation. When this results in a modification of flows that causes prejudice to some uses in favor of others, the benefited titleholders must pay the appropriate compensation, with the river basin authority being responsible, in the absence of an agreement between the parties, for determining its amount.
    The guarantee of rational exploitation of the public hydraulic domain has the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of life and defending and restoring the environment, in accordance with the provisions of article 45.2 of the Constitution.
    For these purposes, for reservoirs with a total capacity of more than 50 hm³, whose main uses are not supply, irrigation and other agricultural uses, in cases where it is appropriate in view of the reservoir's water reserve and seasonal prediction, the river basin authority shall establish at the beginning of each hydrological year:
    a) A minimum and maximum regime of average monthly flows to be released for situations of hydrological normality and prolonged drought.
    b) A regime of minimum volumes of stored reserves for each month.
    c) The minimum monthly reserve that must remain stored in the reservoir to avoid undesirable environmental effects on the fauna and flora of the reservoir and the water bodies associated with it.
    In situations of hydrological normality, the establishment of the aforementioned flow and stored reserve regimes must allow the exercise of the common uses regulated in article 50.
    Likewise, it will be sought that the rational exploitation is compatible with the development of sustainable economic activities linked to the revitalization of the riverside municipalities, within the framework of the order of preference of uses established in the Hydrological Plan of the corresponding basin.
    In the procedure, the River Basin Authority shall in any case give a hearing to the concessionaire, to the competent bodies for river fishing of the corresponding Autonomous Community and to the riverside municipalities of the reservoir.
3.  When there are reserved flows or flows included in a State plan that are not subject to immediate use, precarious concessions may be granted which will not consolidate any right nor give rise to compensation if the river basin authority reduces the flows or revokes the authorizations.
4.  The water administration shall determine, in general, the effective control systems for the flows of water used and for the discharges into the public hydraulic domain that must be established to guarantee respect for existing rights, measure the volume of water actually consumed or used, allow for the correct planning and administration of the resources, and ensure the quality of the waters. To this effect, the holders of administrative water concessions and all those who by any title have the right to its private use, will be obliged to install and maintain the corresponding measurement systems that guarantee precise information on the water flows actually consumed or used and, where appropriate, returned.
    Likewise, it shall establish the method for calculating the flows effectively used when they are surplus flows from other uses.
    The communities of users may also require the establishment of analogous measurement systems for the members or groups of members that are part of them.
    The obligation to install and maintain measurement systems is also enforceable on those who make any type of discharge into the public hydraulic domain. The measurement systems shall be installed at the point determined by the river basin authority, after hearing the users. The user communities may request the installation of a single flow measurement system for the joint uses of interrelated users. In the area of river basins that exceed the territorial scope of an Autonomous Community, the measures provided for in this section shall be adopted by the Ministry of the Environment.
5.  The energy service supply companies referred to in Law 34/1998 of the Hydrocarbons Sector and Law 54/1997 of the Electricity Sector, shall provide the information requested by the River Basin Authority in the exercise of its powers, in relation to the installed capacities and energy consumption for the extraction of groundwater.

**Article 56. Groundwater bodies at risk of not achieving good quantitative or chemical status.**

1.  The Governing Board, without the need to consult the Water Council, may declare that a groundwater body is at risk of not achieving good quantitative or chemical status; in this case, the following measures shall be taken:

    a) Within six months, the River Basin Authority shall constitute a user community if one does not exist, or shall entrust its functions on a temporary basis to an entity representative of the concurrent interests.
    b) After consultation with the user community, the Governing Board shall approve, within a maximum period of one year from the declaration, a program of action for the recovery of the good status of the water body, which shall be included in the program of measures referred to in Article 92 quater. Until the approval of the action program, limitations on extraction may be adopted as well as measures to protect the quality of the groundwater as a precautionary measure.
2.  The action program shall order the regime of extractions to achieve a rational exploitation of the resources in order to achieve a good status of the groundwater bodies, and to protect and improve the associated ecosystems, for which it may, among other measures:

    a) Establish the substitution of pre-existing individual abstractions by community abstractions, transforming, where appropriate, the individual titles with their inherent rights, into a collective one that must conform to the provisions of the action program.
    b) Foresee the contribution of external resources to the groundwater body, in which case it will include the criteria for the joint exploitation of the existing resources in the body and of the external ones.
    c) Include a perimeter within which it will not be possible to grant new concessions of groundwater unless the holders of the pre-existing ones are constituted in user communities, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter IV of Title IV and taking into account the provisions of the seventh additional provision.
    d) Determine protection perimeters for groundwater bodies in which authorization will be necessary to carry out infrastructure works, extraction of aggregates or other activities and installations that may affect it, without prejudice to any other authorizations that may be necessary in accordance with the sectoral legislation in question. Such delimitation and conditions will be binding in the preparation of planning instruments as well as in the granting of licenses, by the public administrations competent in the planning of the territory and urbanism.
3.  The action program will contemplate the conditions under which the established limitations may be temporarily exceeded, allowing extractions superior to the available resources of a groundwater body when the fulfillment of the environmental objectives is guaranteed.
4.  When, as a consequence of the application of the action program, the status of the groundwater body improves, the river basin authority, ex officio or at the request of a party, may progressively reduce the limitations of the program and increase, in a proportional and equitable manner, the volume that can be used, taking into account, in any case, that the permanence of the general environmental objectives provided for in Article 92 et seq. is not put at risk.

**Article 57. Mining uses.**

1.  The holders of the mining uses provided for in the mining legislation may use the waters they capture during the exploitations, dedicating them exclusively to mining purposes. For these purposes, they must request the corresponding concession, processed in accordance with the provisions of this Law.
2.  If there are surplus waters, the holder of the mining use shall make them available to the river basin authority, which shall determine their destination or the conditions under which the drainage must be carried out, paying special attention to their quality.
3.  When the waters captured in mining works affect other concessions, the provisions of this Law shall apply.

**Article 58. Exceptional situations.**

In circumstances of extraordinary droughts, serious overexploitation of aquifers, or in similar states of necessity, urgency, or concurrence of anomalous or exceptional situations, the Government, by means of a Decree agreed upon in the Council of Ministers, after hearing the river basin authority, may adopt, for the overcoming of said situations, the measures that are necessary in relation to the use of the public hydraulic domain, even if it has been the object of a concession.
The approval of said measures shall implicitly carry the declaration of public utility of the works, surveys, and studies necessary to carry them out, for the purposes of temporary occupation and forced expropriation of assets and rights, as well as the urgent need for occupation.

**CHAPTER III**
**On authorizations and concessions**

**Section 1. Water concessions in general**

**Article 59. Administrative concession.**

1.  Any private use of water not included in Article 54 requires an administrative concession.
2.  Concessions shall be granted taking into account the rational joint exploitation of surface and groundwater resources, without the concessional title guaranteeing the availability of the granted flows.
3.  If, for the execution of the works of a new concession, it were necessary to modify the intake or abstraction of another or other pre-existing ones, the river basin authority may impose, or propose in its case, the modification, with the costs and damages caused being borne by the petitioner.
4.  Every concession shall be granted according to the provisions of the Hydrological Plans, on a temporary basis and for a period not exceeding seventy-five years. Its granting shall be discretionary, but every resolution shall be motivated and adopted based on the public interest. Concessions shall be subject to revision in accordance with the provisions of Article 65 of this Law.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1, the bodies of the Central Administration or of the Autonomous Communities may access the use of the waters with prior special authorization extended in their favor or of the State's Assets, without prejudice to third parties.
6.  When for the normal use of a concession the execution of certain works is absolutely necessary, the cost of which cannot be amortized within the time remaining until the end of the concession period, the latter may be extended for the time necessary for the works to be amortized, with a maximum limit of ten years and for a single time, provided that said works do not oppose the corresponding Hydrological Plan and the concessionaire accredits the damages that would be caused to them otherwise.
7.  Ecological flows or environmental demands shall not have the character of use for the purposes of the provisions of this article and the following ones, and must be considered as a restriction that is imposed with a general character on the exploitation systems. In any case, the rule on the supremacy of the use for population supply, as stated in the final paragraph of section 3 of Article 60, shall also apply to environmental flows. Ecological flows shall be established in the River Basin Hydrological Plans. For their establishment, the river basin authorities shall carry out specific studies for each river section.
8.  The granting of a concession does not exempt the concessionaire from obtaining any other type of authorization or license that, in accordance with other laws, is required for its activity or facilities.

**Article 60. Order of preference of uses.**

1.  In the concessions, for the purposes of their granting, the order of preference established in the Hydrological Plan of the corresponding river basin district shall be observed, taking into account the requirements for the protection and conservation of the resource and its environment.
2.  In the absence of said order of preference, the following shall generally apply:

    1.  Population supply, including in its allocation the necessary for industries with low water consumption located in population centers and connected to the municipal network.
    2.  Irrigation and agricultural uses.
    3.  Hydraulic energy storage.
    4.  Industrial uses for electricity production.
    5.  Other industrial uses not included in the previous sections.
    6.  Aquaculture.
    7.  Recreational uses.
    8.  Navigation and aquatic transport.
    9.  Other uses.
    The order of priorities that may be specifically established in the Hydrological Plans of the river basin district must in any case respect the supremacy of the use listed in section 1 of the preceding enumeration, and the priority of the use of hydraulic energy storage over the rest of the industrial uses.
3.  Every concession is subject to forced expropriation, in accordance with the provisions of the general legislation on the matter, in favor of another use that precedes it according to the order of preference established in the Hydrological Plan of the river basin district.
4.  Within each class, in case of incompatibility of uses, those that better satisfy the general interest shall be preferred, those that have been considered of public utility or social interest, those that allow achieving to a greater extent the objectives of hydrological planning and the objectives of planning in matters of energy transition and climate change, those that introduce technical improvements that result in a lower consumption of water, or in the maintenance or improvement of the state of the water bodies.

**Article 61. General conditions of concessions.**

1.  Every concession shall be understood as granted without prejudice to third parties.
2.  The water granted shall be assigned to the uses indicated in the concessional title, and may not be applied to other different uses, nor to different lands in the case of irrigation, with the exception of the provisions of Article 67.
3.  However, the granting Administration may impose the substitution of all or part of the concessional flows with others of a different origin, in order to rationalize the use of the resource.
    The Administration shall only be responsible for the expenses inherent to the substitution work, and may pass on these expenses to the beneficiaries.
4.  When the destination of the waters is for irrigation, the holder of the concession must also be the holder of the lands to which the water is to be destined, without prejudice to the concessions granted to user communities and the provisions of the following article. The concession for irrigation may provide for the application of the water to different surfaces alternatively or successively or provide for a maximum perimeter of surface within which the concessionaire may irrigate some surfaces or others.
5.  The river basin authority may grant collective concessions for irrigation to a plurality of landowners who are integrated by agreement into a group of irrigators, in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of Article 81. In this case, the granting of the new concessional title shall imply the lapse of the pre-existing irrigation concessions held by the members of the group of irrigators on the surfaces covered by the agreement.

**Article 62. Concessions for irrigation under a public service regime.**

1.  Concessions of water for irrigation may be granted, under a public service regime, to companies or individuals, even if they do not hold the ownership of the lands eventually benefiting from the irrigation, provided that the petitioner previously accredits that he has the conformity of the holders who own half of the surface of said lands.
2.  In this case, the granting Administration shall approve the maximum and minimum values of the irrigation tariffs, which must incorporate the amortization quotas for the works.
3.  The holder of a concession for irrigation under a public service regime may not benefit from the provisions of Article 55.3, with the right to request a new concession belonging to the holders of the irrigated surface, under the terms of said section.
4.  The works and facilities that have not reverted to the competent Administration shall pass, where appropriate, to the ownership of the new concessionaire.

**Article 63. Transmission of uses.**

The total or partial transmission of water uses that imply a public service or the constitution of encumbrances thereon shall require prior administrative authorization.
In other cases, it will only be necessary to accredit, in a reliable manner, within the period and form established by regulation, the transfer or constitution of the encumbrance.

**Article 64. Modification of the characteristics of the concession.**

Any modification of the characteristics of a concession shall require prior administrative authorization from the same granting body.

**Article 65. Review of concessions.**

1.  Concessions may be reviewed:

    a) When it is proven that the determining assumptions for their granting have been modified.
    b) In cases of force majeure, at the request of the concessionaire.
    c) When its adaptation to the Hydrological Plans so requires.
2.  Likewise, concessions for the supply of populations and irrigation may be reviewed in cases where it is accredited that the object of the concession can be met with a smaller allocation or an improvement in the technique of using the resource, which contributes to its saving.
    For these purposes, the Hydrographic Confederations shall carry out audits and controls of the concessions, in order to verify the efficiency of the management and use of the hydraulic resources object of the concession.
3.  Only in the case indicated in paragraph c) of section 1, the aggrieved concessionaire shall have the right to compensation, in accordance with the provisions of the general legislation on forced expropriation.
4.  The modification of the concessional conditions in the cases of section 2 shall not grant the concessionaire the right to any economic compensation. Notwithstanding this, aid may be established by regulation in favor of the concessionaires to adjust their facilities to the new concessional conditions.

**Article 66. Lapsing of concessions.**

1.  Concessions may be declared lapsed for non-compliance with any of the essential conditions or deadlines provided therein.
2.  Likewise, the right to the private use of waters, whatever the title of its acquisition, may be declared lapsed for the permanent interruption of the exploitation for three consecutive years, provided that it is attributable to the holder.

**Section 2. Assignment of rights to the private use of waters**

**Article 67. On the assignment of rights contract.**

1.  Concessionaires or holders of any right to the private use of waters may assign, on a temporary basis, to another concessionaire or holder of a right of equal or higher rank according to the order of preference established in the Hydrological Plan of the corresponding basin or, failing that, in article 60 of this Law, with prior administrative authorization, all or part of the rights of use that correspond to them.
    Concessionaires or holders of rights to private non-consumptive uses may not assign their rights for uses that do not have such consideration.
2.  When reasons of general interest justify it, the Minister of the Environment may expressly authorize, on a temporary and exceptional basis, assignments of water use rights that do not respect the rules on the priority of uses referred to in section 1 of this article.
3.  The acquirers of the rights arising from the assignment shall be subrogated in the obligations that correspond to the assignor before the River Basin Authority regarding the use of the water.
4.  The non-compliance with the requirements established in this section shall be cause to declare the lapse of the concessional right of the assignor.

**Article 68. Formalization, authorization and registration of the assignment contract.**

1.  Assignment contracts must be formalized in writing and brought to the attention of the River Basin Authority and the user communities to which the assignor and the assignee belong by means of the transfer of a copy of the contract, within a period of fifteen days from its signing. In the case of assignments between water users for irrigation, the contract must expressly state the identification of the plots that the assignor renounces to irrigate or undertakes to irrigate with a lower allocation during the term of the contract, as well as those that the acquirer will irrigate with the assigned flow.
2.  They shall be understood as authorized, without producing effects between the parties until then, within one month from the notification made to the River Basin Authority, if the latter does not raise an objection when it comes to assignments between members of the same user community, and within two months in all other cases. When the assignment of rights refers to a concession for irrigation and agricultural uses, the River Basin Authority shall forward a copy of the contract to the corresponding Autonomous Community and to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for them to issue a prior report within the scope of their respective competences within ten days.
3.  The River Basin Authority may not authorize the assignment of water use rights, by means of a reasoned resolution, issued and notified within the indicated period, if it negatively affects the regime of exploitation of the resources in the basin, the rights of third parties, the environmental flows, the state or conservation of the aquatic ecosystems or if it fails to comply with any of the requirements indicated in this section, without this giving rise to any right to compensation on the part of those affected. It may also exercise within that period a preferential right of acquisition of the use of the flows to be assigned, redeeming the flows from any private use or alternatively acquiring said rights to allocate them to other private uses that are considered more appropriate according to the criteria established in the hydrological planning.
4.  The River Basin Authorities shall register the contracts for the assignment of water use rights in the Water Register referred to in Article 80, in the manner determined by regulation. Subsequently, they may also be registered in the Property Registry, in the folios opened for the affected administrative concessions.
5.  The competences of the water administration to which this section refers shall be executed in the intra-community basins by the water administration of the corresponding Autonomous Community.

**Article 69. Object of the assignment contract.**

1.  The annual volume subject to assignment may in no case exceed the volume actually used by the assignor. The rules for the calculation of said annual volume shall be established by regulation, taking as a reference the average value of the flow actually used during the series of years to be determined, corrected, where appropriate, according to the objective allocation set by the River Basin Hydrological Plan and the proper use of the water, and in no case may a flow greater than the granted one be assigned.
2.  The flows that are the object of assignment shall be computed as being of effective use of the concession for the purposes of avoiding the possible lapse of the concessional title of the assignor.
3.  The assignment of water use rights may entail an economic compensation that shall be established by mutual agreement between the contracting parties and must be made explicit in the contract. The maximum amount of said compensation may be established by regulation.

**Article 70. Necessary hydraulic facilities and infrastructures.**

1.  When the material execution of the agreed assignments requires the use of hydraulic facilities or infrastructures owned by third parties, their use shall be established by free agreement between the parties.
2.  In the event that the necessary hydraulic facilities or infrastructures are owned by the River Basin Authority, or if the latter is entrusted with their operation, the contracting parties must request, at the same time as they provide a copy of the contract for its authorization, the determination of the regime of use of said facilities or infrastructures, as well as the fixing of the economic levies that correspond in accordance with the current legislation.
3.  If for the material execution of the agreed assignments it were necessary to build new hydraulic facilities or infrastructures, the contracting parties must present, at the same time as they request the authorization, the technical document that adequately defines said works and facilities. When the assigned waters are to be destined for the supply of populations, a report from the health authority on the suitability of the water for said use shall also be presented.
4.  The authorization of the assignment contract shall not in itself imply the authorization for the use or construction of infrastructures to which this article refers.
    The resolution of the River Basin Authority on the use or construction of infrastructures to which the previous paragraph refers shall be independent of the decision it adopts on the authorization or not of the assignment contract, and the deadlines referred to in Article 68, section 2, shall not apply to it.

**Article 71. Rights exchange centers.**

1.  In the situations regulated in articles 55, 56, and 58 of this Law, and in any others that are determined by regulation due to the concurrence of analogous causes, rights exchange centers for water use may be established by Agreement of the Council of Ministers, at the proposal of the Minister of the Environment. In this case, the River Basin Authorities will be authorized to make public offers for the acquisition of water use rights to later assign them to other users at the price offered by the Authority itself. The accounting and registration of the operations carried out under this provision will be kept separately from the rest of the acts in which the River Basin Authorities may intervene.
2.  The Autonomous Communities may urge the River Basin Authorities to make the acquisitions referred to in the previous section to meet specific purposes of autonomous interest within the scope of their competences.
3.  The acquisitions and disposals of the right to water use carried out in accordance with this article must respect the principles of publicity and free competition and will be carried out in accordance with the procedure and selection criteria determined by regulation.

**Article 72. Inter-basin connection infrastructures.**

1.  The General Directorate of Water may authorize the assignment of rights, to which this section refers, which implies the use of infrastructures that interconnect territories of different River Basin Hydrological Plans; this authorization entails the use of the interconnection infrastructures. The assignment requests will be understood as rejected once the foreseen deadlines have elapsed without the administrative resolution having been notified.
2.  Without prejudice to the provisions of article 69.3, the economic-financial regime applicable to these transactions will be that established in the singular rules that regulate the exploitation regime of the corresponding infrastructures.
3.  The authorization of the assignments regulated by this article may not alter the provisions of the exploitation rules of each of the transfers.

**Section 3. Groundwater abstraction and use**

**Article 73. Preference for the granting of groundwater investigation authorizations.**

The owners of the lands affected by the requests for groundwater investigation shall have preference for the granting of the authorization within the same order of priority referred to in Article 60.

**Article 74. Authorizations for groundwater investigation.**

1.  The River Basin Authority may grant authorizations for groundwater investigation, in order to determine the existence of usable flows, after the procedure of competition between concurrent investigation projects that may be presented.
2.  The term of the authorization may not exceed two years and its granting will implicitly carry the declaration of public utility for the purposes of the temporary occupation of the lands necessary for carrying out the work.
3.  If the investigation is favorable, the interested party must, within a period of six months, formalize the request for a concession, which will be processed without competition of projects.

**Article 75. Determination of the location of the facilities.**

When the concessionaire is not the owner of the land where the abstraction is carried out and the use has been declared of public utility, the River Basin Authority shall determine the location of the facilities, in order to minimize possible damages, the compensation for which shall be fixed in accordance with the legislation on forced expropriation.

**Article 76. Effect on prior abstractions.**

In the absence of a River Basin Hydrological Plan, or sufficient definition therein, the granting Administration shall consider for the granting of groundwater concessions its possible effect on prior legalized abstractions, and the holder of the new concession must, in any case, compensate for the damages that may be caused to the pre-existing uses, as a consequence of the conditioning of the works and facilities that it is necessary to carry out to ensure the availability of the previously exploited flows.

**Section 4. Other authorizations and concessions**

**Article 77. Use of channels or assets located in them.**

1.  The use or exploitation by private individuals of the channels or of the assets located in them shall require prior concession or administrative authorization.
2.  In the granting of concessions or authorizations for the use of aggregates, pastures and arboreal or shrubby vegetation, the establishment of bridges or footbridges, piers and facilities for public baths, the possible unfavorable ecological impact will be considered, and adequate guarantees for the restitution of the environment must be required.
3.  The initiation of the files on the use of aggregates will be notified to the bodies responsible for the maritime-terrestrial public domain of the same basin so that they can opt for their use in the regeneration of the coastline, which will always be preferential over any other possible private use.

**CHAPTER IV**
**On the communities of users**

**Article 81. Obligation to form user communities.**

1.  The users of water and other assets of the public hydraulic domain of the same intake or concession must constitute themselves into user communities. When the main use is irrigation, they shall be called irrigator communities; in any other case, their name will reflect the purpose of the collective use.
    The statutes or ordinances shall be drafted and approved by the users themselves, and shall be submitted for administrative approval to the River Basin Authority.
    The statutes or ordinances shall regulate the organization of the communities of users, as well as the exploitation in an internal autonomy regime of the inherent hydraulic assets.
    The River Basin Authority may not refuse the approval of the statutes and ordinances, nor introduce variants in them, without a prior ruling from the Council of State.
2.  The user communities of surface or groundwater, whose use affects interests that are common, may form a central board for the defense of their rights and conservation and promotion of common interests.
3.  In the same way, individual users and user communities may form by agreement a central user board for the purpose of protecting their rights and interests against third parties and ordering and monitoring the coordinated use of their own uses.
4.  The River Basin Authority may impose, when the general interest so requires, the constitution of the different types of communities and central user boards.
5.  When the modality or the circumstances and characteristics of the use advise it, or when the number of participants is small, the community regime may be substituted by that established in specific agreements, which must be approved by the River Basin Authority.

**Article 82. Nature and legal regime of user communities.**

1.  User communities have the character of public law corporations, attached to the River Basin Authority, which shall ensure the fulfillment of their statutes or ordinances and the proper order of the use. They shall act in accordance with the procedures established in this Law, in their regulations and in their statutes and ordinances, in accordance with the provisions of Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and the Common Administrative Procedure.
2.  The statutes and ordinances of the user communities shall include the purpose and territorial scope of the use of the assets of the public hydraulic domain, shall regulate the mandatory participation and representation, in relation to their respective interests, of the current and successive holders of assets and services and of the participants in the use of water; and shall oblige all holders to contribute in equitable proportion to the common expenses of exploitation, conservation, repair and improvement, as well as the corresponding levies and tariffs. The statutes and ordinances of the communities, as agreed by their general board, shall establish the corresponding provisions for the infractions and sanctions that may be imposed by the jury in accordance with the custom and the own procedure of the same, guaranteeing the rights of hearing and defense of those affected.
3.  The general communities and the central user boards shall be composed of representatives of the interested users. Their ordinances and regulations must be approved by the River Basin Authority.
4.  The user communities that lack ordinances shall be obliged to present them for their approval within the period established by regulation. In case of non-compliance, the River Basin Authority may establish those it deems appropriate after a ruling from the Council of State.

**Article 83. Powers of user communities.**

1.  User communities may execute by themselves and at the user's expense, the unfulfilled agreements that impose an obligation to do. The cost of the subsidiary execution will be enforceable through the administrative enforcement procedure. Those obligations that are of a personal nature will be excepted from the previous regime.
2.  User communities will be beneficiaries of the forced expropriation and the imposition of the easements required by their uses and the fulfillment of their purposes.
3.  User communities will be obliged to carry out the works and installations that the Administration orders them, in order to avoid the misuse of water or the deterioration of the public hydraulic domain, and the competent River Basin Authority may suspend the use of water until they are carried out.
4.  The debts to the user community for conservation, cleaning or improvement expenses, as well as any other motivated by the administration and distribution of the waters, will encumber the property or industry in whose favor they were made, and the user community may demand their amount through the administrative enforcement procedure, and prohibit the use of water while they are not satisfied, even if the property or industry has changed owner. The same criterion will be followed when the debt comes from fines and indemnities imposed by the courts or irrigation juries.

**Article 84. Bodies of the user communities.**

1.  Every user community shall have a general board or assembly, a governing board, and one or more juries.
2.  The General Board, constituted by all the users of the community, is the sovereign body thereof, and is responsible for all powers not specifically attributed to any other body.
3.  The Governing Board, elected by the General Board, is in charge of executing the ordinances and its own agreements and those adopted by the General Board.
4.  The powers of the governing board shall be:

    a) To watch over and manage the interests of the Community, promote its development and defend its rights.
    b) To issue the convenient provisions for the best distribution of the waters, respecting the acquired rights and local customs.
    c) To submit to the approval of the board the modification of the ordinances or any other proposal it deems appropriate.
    d) To execute within the scope of its competences the functions that are attributed to it by the laws or that they may assume by virtue of the agreements they sign with the River Basin Authority.
5.  The agreements of the general board and the governing board, within the scope of their competences, shall be executive, in the form and with the requirements established in the Law on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and the Common Administrative Procedure, without prejudice to their possible appeal in cassation before the River Basin Authority.
6.  The jury is responsible for knowing the questions of fact that arise among the users of the community within the scope of the ordinances and for imposing on the offenders the regulatory sanctions, as well as for setting the indemnities that may derive from the infraction.
    The procedures shall be public and verbal in the form determined by custom and the regulation. Their rulings shall be executive.

**Article 85. Survival of traditional organizations.**

Collective uses that until now have had a regime consigned in duly approved ordinances will continue to be subject to them as long as the users do not decide to modify them in accordance with them.
In the same way, where there are irrigation juries or courts, whatever their peculiar denomination, they will continue with their traditional organization.

**Article 86. Ownership of the works that integrate the use.**

The ownership of the works that are an integral part of the use of the user community will be defined in the title that authorizes their construction and use.

**Article 87. User communities of hydrogeological units and aquifers.**

1.  The users of the same hydrogeological unit or the same aquifer will be obliged, at the request of the River Basin Authority, to form a user community, with said Authority being responsible, at the request of a party or ex officio, for determining its limits and establishing the system of joint use of the waters.
2.  In aquifers declared overexploited or at risk of being so in application of section 1 of article 56 of this Law, the constitution of a user community will be mandatory. If six months have elapsed since the date of the declaration of overexploitation and the user community has not been constituted, the River Basin Authority will constitute it ex officio, or will entrust its functions on a temporary basis to a representative body of the concurrent interests.
3.  The River Basin Authorities may enter into agreements with the communities of groundwater users, in order to establish the collaboration of these in the functions of effective control of the exploitation regime and respect for the rights over the waters. In these agreements, it may be provided, among other things, for the substitution of pre-existing groundwater abstractions by community abstractions, as well as the economic and technical support of the River Basin Authority to the user community for the fulfillment of the terms of the agreement.

**Article 88. Communities for the joint use of surface and groundwater.**

The River Basin Authority may compel the constitution of communities that have as their object the joint use of surface and groundwater, when the best use of the resources of the same area so advises.

**Article 89. Requirements for the supply to several populations.**

1.  The granting of concessions for supply to several populations will be conditioned on the Local Corporations being constituted for these purposes in Commonwealths, Consortiums or other similar entities, in accordance with the legislation by which they are governed, or on all of them receiving the water through the same concessionaire company.
2.  Regardless of their special legal status, the consortium or Community in question will prepare the ordinances provided for in article 81.

**Article 90. User communities for discharges.**

Public entities, corporations or individuals who need to discharge water or residual products may form a community to carry out the study, construction, exploitation and improvement of collectors, treatment plants and common elements that allow them to make the discharge in the most suitable place and under the best technical and economic conditions, considering the necessary protection of the natural environment. The River Basin Authority may justifiably impose the constitution of this class of user communities.

**Article 91. Other user communities. Rules of application.**

The provisions contained in the previous articles may be applied to other types of communities not expressly mentioned, and, among them, to those for drainage or those constituted for the construction, conservation and improvement of defense works against floods.

2.  The programs of measures specified in the hydrological plans must specify the actions and provisions necessary to achieve the indicated environmental objectives.
3.  When there are water bodies heavily affected by human activity or their natural conditions make the achievement of the indicated objectives unfeasible or require a disproportionate cost, less stringent environmental objectives will be indicated under the conditions established in each case through the hydrological plans.

**Article 92 ter. Status of water bodies.**

1.  In relation to the protection objectives, different states or potentials will be distinguished in the water bodies, with a differentiation being made at least between surface waters, groundwater, and artificial and heavily modified water bodies. The technical conditions defining each of the states and potentials, as well as the criteria for their classification, will be determined by regulation.
2.  In each river basin district, monitoring programs for the state of the waters will be established that allow for a coherent and complete overall view of said state. These programs will be incorporated into the programs of measures that must be developed in each district.

**Article 92 quater. Programs of measures.**

1.  For each river basin district, a program of measures will be established in which the results of the studies carried out to determine the characteristics of the district, the repercussions of human activity on its waters, as well as the economic study of the use of water in the same, will be taken into account.
2.  The programs of measures will have as their purpose the achievement of the environmental objectives indicated in Article 92 bis of this law.
3.  The measures may be basic and complementary:
    a) Basic measures are the minimum requirements that must be met in each district and will be established by regulation.
    b) Complementary measures are those that in each case must be applied with an additional character for the achievement of the environmental objectives or to achieve additional protection of the waters.
4.  The program of measures will be composed of the basic and complementary measures that, within the scope of their competences, are approved by the competent Administrations in the protection of the waters.

**Article 93. Concept of pollution.**

Pollution, for the purposes of this law, is understood as the action and effect of introducing materials or forms of energy, or inducing conditions in the water that, directly or indirectly, imply a prejudicial alteration of its quality in relation to subsequent uses, to human health, or to the aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems directly associated with the aquatic ones; cause damage to property; and deteriorate or hinder the enjoyment and uses of the environment.
The concept of degradation of the public hydraulic domain, for the purposes of this law, includes the prejudicial alterations of the environment affected by said domain.

**Article 94. Water police.**

1.  The police of the waters and other elements of the public hydraulic domain, easement zones and protection perimeters, shall be exercised by the competent water administration.

    f) The direction of the river guard services.
    g) In general, the application of the regulations on water and channel police.
3.  In the exercise of their function, the Environmental Agents assigned to the water commissariats of the River Basin Authorities have the character of public authority and are empowered to:
    a) Enter freely at any time and without prior notice into the places subject to inspection and to remain in them, with respect in any case for the inviolability of the home. When carrying out an inspection visit, they must communicate their presence to the inspected person or their representative, unless they consider that said communication could jeopardize the success of their functions.
    b) Proceed to carry out any investigation, examination or test that they consider necessary to verify that the legal provisions are correctly observed.
    c) To take or remove samples of substances and materials used or in the establishment, make measurements, obtain photographs, videos, image recordings, and draw up sketches and plans, provided that the employer or their representative is notified.
4.  The facts established by the officials of the Environmental Agents Scale that are formalized in the corresponding records will have a presumption of certainty, without prejudice to the evidence that in defense of the respective rights and interests the interested parties may provide.
5.  The River Guards will carry out support and assistance tasks for the Environmental Agents in the exercise of their water police functions.

**Article 95. Surveying and demarcation of the public domain channels.**

1.  The surveying and demarcation of the public domain channels corresponds to the State Administration, which will carry them out through the River Basin Authorities, according to the procedure determined by regulation.
2.  The approved demarcation declares the possession and ownership of the domain in favor of the State, giving rise to the marking of boundaries.
3.  The resolution approving the demarcation will be sufficient title to rectify the contradictory inscriptions in the Property Registry, in the form and conditions determined by regulation, provided that the registered owner has intervened in the file, in accordance with the mortgage legislation. Said resolution will also be sufficient title for the Administration to proceed with the registration of the public domain assets when it deems it convenient. In any case, the holders of the affected registered rights may exercise the actions they deem pertinent in defense of their rights, being susceptible to preventive annotation the corresponding judicial claim.

**Article 96. Easement and police zone in surface reservoirs, lakes and lagoons.**

1.  Around the surface reservoirs, the River Basin Authority may provide in its projects for the service areas necessary for their operation.
2.  In any case, the margins of lakes, lagoons and reservoirs will be subject to the easement and police zones established for watercourses.

Any activity likely to cause the pollution or degradation of the public hydraulic domain is prohibited, in general, and without prejudice to the provisions of Article 100, and, in particular:

a) Accumulating solid waste, debris or substances, whatever their nature and the place where they are deposited, that constitute or may constitute a danger of pollution of the waters or degradation of their environment.
b) Carrying out actions on the physical or biological environment affected by water, which constitute or may constitute a degradation thereof.
c) The exercise of activities within the protection perimeters, established in the Hydrological Plans, when they could constitute a danger of pollution or degradation of the public hydraulic domain.

**Article 98. Environmental limitations on authorizations and concessions.**

The River Basin Authorities, in the concessions and authorizations they grant, shall adopt the necessary measures to make the use compatible with respect for the environment and to guarantee the ecological flows or environmental demands provided for in the hydrological planning.
In the processing of concessions and authorizations that affect the public hydraulic domain that could entail risks for the environment, the presentation of a report on the possible harmful effects on the environment will be mandatory, which will be transferred to the competent environmental body for it to pronounce on the corrective measures that, in its opinion, should be introduced as a consequence of the presented report.
Without prejudice to the cases in which it is mandatory, in accordance with the current regulations, in cases where the River Basin Authority presumes the existence of a serious risk to the environment, it will also submit to the consideration of the competent environmental body the convenience of initiating the environmental impact assessment procedure.

**Article 99. Protection of groundwater against saline water intrusions.**

The protection of groundwater against saline water intrusions, of continental or maritime origin, will be carried out, among other actions, by limiting the exploitation of the affected aquifers and, where appropriate, the spatial redistribution of existing abstractions. The basic criteria for this will be included in the River Basin Hydrological Plans, with the River Basin Authority being responsible for adopting the appropriate measures.

**Article 99 bis. Register of Protected Areas.**

1.  For each river basin district, there shall be at least one register of areas that have been declared subject to special protection by virtue of a specific rule on the protection of surface or groundwater, or on the conservation of habitats and species directly dependent on water.
2.  The register shall necessarily include:
    a) The areas where a water abstraction intended for human consumption is carried out, provided that it provides an average volume of at least 10 cubic meters per day or serves more than fifty people, as well as, where appropriate, the delimited protection perimeters.
    b) The areas that, in accordance with the respective hydrological plan, are to be destined in the future for the abstraction of waters for human consumption.
    c) The areas that have been declared for the protection of economically significant aquatic species.

    The register must be revised and updated, together with the update of the corresponding hydrological plan, in the manner determined by regulation.
4.  A summary of the register will form part of the river basin hydrological plan.
5.  The urban planning instruments will contain the adequate provisions to guarantee that the water resources of the areas included in letters a), b) and d) of section 2 and the protection perimeters established for that purpose by the Water Administration are not affected.

**CHAPTER II**
**On discharges**

**Section 1. Discharges into the public hydraulic domain**

**Article 100. Concept.**

1.  For the purposes of this Law, discharges are considered to be those made directly or indirectly into continental waters, as well as into the rest of the public hydraulic domain, whatever the procedure or technique used. The direct or indirect discharge of waters and residual products likely to contaminate continental waters or any other element of the public hydraulic domain is generally prohibited, unless a prior administrative authorization is obtained.
2.  The authorization of discharge will have as its object the achievement of the environmental objectives established in the hydrological plans. Said authorizations will be granted taking into account the best available techniques and in accordance with the environmental quality standards and the emission limits established by regulation. More stringent discharge conditions will be established when the fulfillment of the environmental objectives so requires.
3.  The discharge authorization may also contemplate the quality of the water required for other uses located downstream from the discharge point, requiring more rigorous objectives when, in accordance with the provisions of article 109 quinquies.1, the river basin district's hydrological plan determines that it is necessary to incentivize the reuse of waters.
4.  When an authorization is granted or its conditions are modified, deadlines and pollution reduction programs may be established for the progressive adaptation of the characteristics of the discharges to the limits set therein.
5.  The authorization of discharge does not exempt from any other that may be necessary, in accordance with other laws for the activity or installation in question.

**Article 101. Discharge authorization.**

1.  The discharge authorizations shall establish the conditions under which they must be carried out, in the manner determined by regulation.
    In any case, they must specify the necessary treatment facilities and the control elements of their operation, as well as the quantitative and qualitative limits imposed on the composition of the effluent and the amount of the discharge control levy defined in article 113.
2.  The discharge authorizations shall correspond to the competent water administration, except in the cases of discharges made at any point of the sewerage network or collectors managed by the autonomous or local Administrations or by entities dependent on them, in which the authorization shall correspond to the competent autonomous or local body.
3.  The discharge authorizations shall have a maximum validity period of five years, successively renewable, provided that they comply with the quality standards and environmental objectives enforceable at any given time. Otherwise, they may be modified or revoked in accordance with the provisions of articles 104 and 105.
4.  For the purposes of granting, renewing or modifying the discharge authorizations, the applicant shall accredit before the competent water administration, in the terms established by regulation, the adequacy of the treatment facilities and the control elements of their operation, to the standards and quality objectives of the waters. Likewise, with the periodicity and within the deadlines established by regulation, the holders of discharge authorizations must accredit before the water administration the conditions under which they discharge.
    The data to be accredited before the water administration, in accordance with this section, may be certified by the entities that are approved for this purpose, in accordance with what is determined by regulation.
5.  The applications for discharge authorizations from the Local Entities shall contain, in any case, a plan for sanitation and control of discharges to municipal collectors. The Local Entities shall be obliged to inform the water administration about the existence of discharges into the local collectors of toxic and dangerous substances regulated by the regulations on water quality.

**Article 102. Authorization of discharge into aquifers and groundwater.**

When the discharge may give rise to the infiltration or storage of substances susceptible of contaminating the aquifers or groundwater, it may only be authorized if the prior hydrogeological study demonstrates its innocuousness.

**Article 103. Limitations on polluting industrial activities.**

The administrative authorizations on the establishment, modification or transfer of facilities or industries that generate or may generate discharges, shall be granted conditional on obtaining the corresponding discharge authorization.
The Government may prohibit, in specific areas, those activities and industrial processes whose effluents, despite the treatment to which they are subjected, may constitute a risk of serious pollution for the waters, either in their normal operation or in case of foreseeable exceptional situations.

**Article 104. Review of discharge authorizations.**

1.  The River Basin Authority may review the discharge authorizations in the following cases:
    a) When circumstances arise that, had they existed previously, would have justified its denial or its granting in different terms.
    b) When an improvement in the characteristics of the discharge occurs and the interested party so requests.
    c) To adapt the discharge to the standards and quality objectives of the waters that are applicable at any given time and, in particular, to those that for each river, river section, aquifer or water body are provided for in the River Basin Hydrological Plans.
2.  In exceptional cases, for reasons of drought or in extreme hydrological situations, the River Basin Authorities may modify, in general, the discharge conditions in order to guarantee the quality objectives.

**Article 105. Unauthorized discharges.**

1.  Once the existence of an unauthorized discharge is verified, or one that does not comply with the conditions of the authorization, the River Basin Authority shall carry out the following actions:
    a) Initiate a sanctioning procedure and a procedure to determine the damage caused to the quality of the waters.
    b) Liquidate the discharge control levy, in accordance with the provisions of article 113.
2.  Additionally, the River Basin Authority may agree to initiate the following procedures:
    a) Revocation of the discharge authorization, if any, in case of non-compliance with any of its conditions.
    When the discharge authorization in inter-community basins has been integrated into the integrated environmental authorization, the river basin authority will communicate the revocation by issuing a mandatory and binding report to the competent Autonomous Community, for the purposes of its compliance.
    b) Authorization of the discharge, if not available, when it is susceptible to legalization.
    c) Declaration of lapse of the water concession in the especially qualified cases of non-compliance with the conditions or non-existence of authorization, from which very serious damages to the public hydraulic domain result.
3.  The revocations and declarations of lapse agreed upon in accordance with the previous section shall not give rise to the right to compensation.

**Article 106. Suspension of activities that cause unauthorized discharges.**

The Government, within the scope of its powers, may order the suspension of activities that give rise to unauthorized discharges, if it does not deem it more appropriate to adopt the precise measures for their correction, without prejudice to the civil, criminal, or administrative liability that the perpetrators may have incurred.

**Article 107. Operation of treatment plants by the River Basin Authority.**

The River Basin Authority may take charge directly or indirectly, for reasons of general interest and on a temporary basis, of the operation of wastewater treatment facilities, when the paralysis of the activities that produce the discharge is not appropriate and serious inconveniences would arise from the non-compliance with the authorized conditions.
In this case, the River Basin Authority will claim from the holder of the authorization, even through the enforcement procedure:
a) The necessary amounts to modify or condition the facilities in the terms provided for in the authorization.
b) The costs of operation, maintenance, and conservation of the facilities.

**Article 108. Discharge companies.**

Discharge companies may be established to conduct, treat, and discharge wastewater from third parties. The discharge authorizations granted in their favor will include, in addition to the conditions required in general, the following:
a) The admissibility of the discharges that are to be treated by the company.
b) The maximum tariffs and the procedure for their periodic update.
c) The obligation to constitute a guarantee to be liable for the continuity and effectiveness of the treatments.
The amount of the guarantee and the effects derived from the revocation of the authorization will be determined by regulation.

**Section 2. Marine discharges**

**Article 108 bis. General principles.**

1.  The protection of marine waters shall have as its object to interrupt or gradually eliminate discharges, emissions, and losses of priority hazardous substances, with the ultimate objective of achieving concentrations in the marine environment close to baseline values for substances of natural origin and close to zero for artificial synthetic substances.
2.  The general principles enumerated in the previous section shall be incorporated by the applicable sectoral legislation in each case.

**CHAPTER III**
**On the reuse of waters**

**Article 109. The reuse of waters.**

1.  Reuse of treated waters is understood as the use for a new private purpose, before its return to the public hydraulic or maritime-terrestrial domain, of waters that, having been used by the person who derived them, have been subjected to a treatment that allows their quality to be adapted to the use to which they are to be destined. The waters subjected to this treatment are called reclaimed waters.
    The effective reuse of reclaimed waters will not have the condition of discharge.
    In industrial uses, the recirculation of these within the industrial processes of the activity itself will not be considered water reuse.
2.  Public administrations, as a means to promote the circular economy and reinforce adaptation to climate change, must promote the reuse of water, providing for this the economic instruments they consider appropriate.
    Public administrations may grant aid to the concessionaire of reclaimed waters, which may cover all of the additional costs associated with the reuse of water, in the situations established in section 1 of article 109 quinquies.
    The public administrations competent in matters of supply, sanitation, and treatment of urban agglomerations of more than 50,000 inhabitants must prepare plans that promote the reuse of water associated with urban uses.
3.  Reclaimed waters may be used for those uses that are compatible with the provisions contained in the hydrological planning, and provided that a high level of protection for human health, animal health, and the environment is ensured.
    The basic conditions for the reuse of waters and the quality required for reclaimed waters for the authorized uses shall be established by regulation.
    The reuse of water for direct human consumption is prohibited, except in situations of declared catastrophe, in which the health authority will specify the quality levels required for said waters and the uses.
4.  The hydrological plan of each river basin district shall establish the allocations and reserves of the volumes of reclaimed water necessary to meet the different uses.

**Article 109 bis. Legal regime for the use of reclaimed waters.**

1.  The use of reclaimed waters shall require an administrative concession or the modification of the characteristics of an existing concession, in accordance with the general regime established in this law for the private use of the public hydraulic domain.
    Within the procedure of competition of projects, the first user and the holder of the discharge authorization shall be notified.
    The river basin authority shall resolve in a reasoned manner the submitted applications, with a prior mandatory and binding report from the health authorities.
2.  When the interested party in the use of the reclaimed waters is the first user and the use to which it is to be destined is recognized within the framework of their original concession, they shall be exempt from the need to have a new concession. In such a case, the interested party shall request from the river basin authority the modification of the existing concession to include the use of the requested reclaimed waters. The river basin authority shall modify the original concession to reflect this aspect as long as it is compatible with the hydrological plan and with the rights of use of third parties, being exempt from the procedure of competition of projects. In any case, the concessionaire shall be subject to the regime of authorizations and controls provided for in articles 109 ter and 109 quater.
    The same procedure shall apply when the concessionaire for the first use of the waters is an association of municipalities or a public entity that represents them, and the request for concession is formulated, through said entity holding the concession, by at least one of the associated or represented municipalities.
3.  The concessionaire shall be responsible for the use of the reclaimed water supplied to them, under the terms provided in this law and in the Risk Management Plan for reclaimed waters defined in section 3 of article 109 ter.

**Article 109 ter. Legal regime for the production and supply of reclaimed waters.**

1.  The production and supply of reclaimed waters shall be subject to authorization.
    The authorizations shall be granted by the river basin authority, with a prior mandatory and binding report from the health authorities.
    The authorizations shall include a condition based on the Risk Management Plan for reclaimed waters defined in section 3 and shall be periodically reviewed.
2.  The authorization does not exempt its holders from obtaining other mandatory licenses or authorizations for the exercise of the activity, in particular those established in article 84 of Law 7/1985, of April 2, Regulating the Bases of the Local Regime, and in article 5 of the consolidated text of the Law on integrated prevention and control of pollution, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2016, of December 16.
    In the event that the applicant is not the holder of the discharge authorization, the latter shall be notified, and shall have preference for the granting of the authorization for the production or supply of reclaimed waters.
3.  In order to ensure that reclaimed waters are used and managed safely, the responsible parties and end-users shall prepare a Risk Management Plan for reclaimed waters, through which the set of functions within the water reuse system will be coordinated.
    The Risk Management Plan for reclaimed waters will define the reuse system and identify the risks associated with the functions related to the production, supply and use of reclaimed waters, the key elements for the management of such risks and the necessary measures and actions to keep it at acceptable levels for the environment, human health and animal health. Likewise, it will identify the responsible parties and delimit the responsibility incumbent on each of them and the end-user in the water reuse system, in relation to the fulfillment of said Plan.
    The Plan will be presented together with the application for the granting, renewal or modification of the authorization for the production or supply of reclaimed waters for its evaluation by the river basin authority.

**Article 109 quater. Control of compliance with the granted authorization.**

1.  The responsible parties identified in the reuse system and the users of the reclaimed waters must ensure compliance with the requirements established in the granted authorization or concession and in the part of the Risk Management Plan for reclaimed waters that corresponds to them.
2.  The river basin authority and the health authorities shall be responsible for monitoring the control of compliance with the conditions established in the Risk Management Plan for reclaimed waters and in the authorizations for the production and supply of reclaimed waters.
    The responsible parties must periodically accredit compliance with the conditions established in the Risk Management Plan for reclaimed waters, which may be done through a certificate issued by a collaborating entity of the water administration, all of this without prejudice to the inspection powers that correspond to the river basin authorities and the health authorities.

**Article 109 quinquies. Costs associated with the reuse of waters.**

1.  The river basin authorities, within the framework of hydrological planning, shall determine those situations where the substitution, total or partial, of a concession of surface or groundwater abstraction by reclaimed waters contributes to achieving the environmental objectives of the water bodies or to optimizing the management of water resources. In these situations, the aid provided for in article 109.2 or the exemption established in article 114.2 may be granted to the user.
    The additional costs associated with the reuse of waters in these situations may be assumed by the Administrations or other entities that benefit from the substitution.
2.  In accordance with the provisions of article 113.1, the volume of water that is reused will be exempt from the discharge control levy.

**CHAPTER IV**
**On State aid**

**Article 110. State aid for activities that improve water quality.**

The aid that may be granted to those who proceed with the development, implementation or modification of technologies, processes, facilities or equipment, as well as changes in operation, that mean a decrease in the uses and consumption of water or a lower contribution at source of polluting loads to the used waters, shall be determined by regulation.
Likewise, aid may be granted to those who carry out forest plantations, whose objective is the protection of water resources.
This aid will be extended to those who proceed with the potabilization and desalination of water and the treatment of wastewater, through more adequate processes or methods, the implementation of wastewater reuse systems, or develop research activities in these matters.

**CHAPTER V**
**On wetlands**

**Article 111. Concept and characteristics.**

1.  Marshy or waterlogged areas, including those created artificially, shall be considered wetlands.
2.  The delimitation of wetlands shall be carried out in accordance with the corresponding specific legislation.
3.  Any activity that affects such areas shall require administrative authorization or concession.
4.  The River Basin Authorities and the competent environmental Administration shall coordinate their actions for the conservation, effective protection, sustainable management, and recovery of wetlands, especially those that have a natural or scenic interest.
5.  The River Basin Authorities may promote the declaration of certain wetlands as being of special interest for their conservation and protection, in accordance with environmental legislation.
6.  Likewise, the River Basin Authorities, with a prior favorable report from the competent bodies in matters of the Environment, may promote the drainage of those wetlands declared unhealthy or whose sanitation is considered of public interest.

**TITLE VI**
**On the economic-financial regime for the utilization of the public hydraulic domain**

**Article 111 bis. General principles.**

1.  The competent public Administrations, by virtue of the principle of cost recovery and taking into account long-term economic projections, shall establish the appropriate mechanisms to pass on the costs of the services related to water management, including environmental and resource costs, to the different end users.
2.  The application of the principle of recovery of the mentioned costs must be done in a way that encourages the efficient use of water and, therefore, contributes to the pursued environmental objectives.
    Likewise, the application of the mentioned principle must be carried out with an adequate contribution from the various uses, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, and considering at least the uses of supply, agriculture, and industry. All of this with the application of transparency criteria.
    To this end, the Administration with competences in matters of water supply shall establish tariff structures by consumption brackets, with the aim of meeting basic needs at an affordable price and discouraging excessive consumption.
3.  For the application of the principle of cost recovery, the social, environmental, and economic consequences, as well as the geographical and climatic conditions of each territory and of the affected populations, shall be taken into account, provided that this does not compromise the purposes or the achievement of the established environmental objectives.
    By resolution of the competent Administration, which in the scope of the General State Administration shall correspond to the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Environment, reasoned exceptions to the principle of cost recovery may be established for certain uses, taking into account the same consequences and conditions mentioned and without, in any case, compromising the purposes or the achievement of the corresponding environmental objectives. For this, the river basin authorities shall issue, within a period of three months, with a mandatory and prior character to the resolution that is adopted, a reasoned report that, in any case, justifies that neither the purposes nor the environmental achievements established in the respective hydrological plans are compromised.

**Article 112. Levy for the use of the assets of the public hydraulic domain.**

1.  The occupation, use, and exploitation of the assets of the public hydraulic domain included in paragraphs b) and c) of article 2 of this Law, which require an administrative concession or authorization, shall accrue in favor of the competent River Basin Authority a fee called a levy for the use of the assets of the public hydraulic domain, intended for the protection and improvement of said domain. The concessionaires of waters shall be exempt from the payment of the levy for the occupation or use of the public domain lands necessary to carry out the concession.
2.  The accrual of the fee shall occur with the initial granting and the annual maintenance of the concession or authorization and shall be payable in the amount that corresponds and in the deadlines indicated in the conditions of said concession or authorization.
3.  The taxpayers of the levy shall be the concessionaires or authorized persons or, where appropriate, those who are subrogated in their place.
4.  The taxable base of the levy shall be determined by the River Basin Authority according to the following assumptions:
    a) In the case of occupation of lands of the public hydraulic domain, by the value of the occupied land taking as a reference the market value of the contiguous lands.
    b) In the case of use of the public hydraulic domain, by the value of said use or the benefit obtained with it.
    For floating solar photovoltaic electricity generation facilities in the public hydraulic domain, the taxable base is determined as the product of the annual average price of the daily and intraday market published by the National Commission of Markets and Competition for the accrued year, by the production of the plant.
    c) In the case of exploitation of assets of the public hydraulic domain, by the value of the materials consumed or the utility that said exploitation reports.
5.  The annual tax rate shall be 5 percent in the cases provided for in paragraphs a) and b) of the previous section, and 100 percent in the case of paragraph c), which will be applied on the value of the resulting taxable base in each case.
6.  In the case of inter-community basins, this levy shall be collected by the River Basin Authority or by the State Tax Administration, by virtue of an agreement with it. In this second case, the State Tax Administration Agency will receive from the River Basin Authority the relevant data and censuses that facilitate its management, and will periodically inform it in the manner determined by regulation. The collected levy will be made available to the corresponding River Basin Authority.

**Article 112 bis. Levy for the use of continental waters for the production of electrical energy.**

1.  The taxable event of this levy is the use and exploitation of the assets of the public domain referred to in paragraph a) of Article 2 of this law, for the production of electrical energy at the power plant busbars, which will have the nature of a fee and will be intended for the protection and improvement of the public hydraulic domain.
    The aforementioned levy will only be applicable in the river basins of state competence.
2.  The accrual of the levy will occur with the initial granting and the annual maintenance of the hydroelectric concession.
3.  Taxpayers of the levy, as contributors, will be the holders of a hydroelectric use.
4.  The taxable base of the levy will be the economic value of the hydroelectric energy produced in each annual tax period by the holder of a hydroelectric use through the use and exploitation of the public hydraulic domain, measured at the power plant busbars, in accordance with the power defined in the following paragraph, which the concessionaire must declare in the corresponding self-assessment.
    For the purposes of determining the taxable base and the thresholds from which the reduction provided for in section 7 of this article operates, "installation" shall be understood as the hydroelectric power plant and "power of the installation" as the sum of the powers of the groups installed in it, without the total power of each plant included in the title of a hydroelectric use being able to be subdivided for the purposes of the levy into groups of lower individual power.
    "Power of the groups" shall be understood, for the purposes of this law, as the installed power or the nominal power that is registered in the Administrative Registry of Electrical Energy Production Facilities, established by Royal Decree 1955/2000, of December 1, which regulates the activities of transport, distribution, commercialization, supply and authorization procedures for electrical energy facilities.
    The economic value of the produced energy shall be considered the total remuneration obtained by the taxpayer for the energy produced that it incorporates into the electrical system during each calendar year—or fraction of a year in the first and last year of the concession—of operation of the installation.
    For the purposes of calculating the economic value, the remunerations provided for in all the economic regimes that derive from what is established in the regulations of the electricity sector will be taken into account and will be calculated separately for each hydroelectric generation installation, without prejudice to what is indicated in section 4 regarding the power thresholds from which the reduction provided for in section 7 of this article operates.
    The taxable base of this levy will be determined by the total amount of the collection rights that appear in the sales invoices made available to the subject of the settlement. Said taxable base will be determined in accordance with the information obtained from the settlement processes of the market operator, the system operator and, where appropriate, the body in charge of the settlements, incentives and complements of electrical energy production facilities with the right to a specific or additional remuneration scheme approved by the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, as well as that provided by each taxpayer.
5.  The competent Ministry, in relation to the cited registry, will annually send to the Hydrographic Confederations the certified information related to the definitive registration number of each installation, its technology, the installed power and the net power or, where appropriate, the nominal power in megawatts (MW).
    For the purposes of verifying the calculation of the taxable base reflected in the self-assessments, the following information obligations are established in favor of the River Basin Authorities:
    a) Red Eléctrica de España, S.A., as system operator, will directly provide each river basin authority in the area that corresponds to it with the measures that accredit the productive activity of the holders of hydroelectric energy generating facilities whose management it is in charge of, and the economic value of the energy produced, as well as the information related to the energy supplied for pumping to these holder companies. Said information will be broken down for each of the existing hydroelectric facilities in the respective basin, whatever its power, with an indication of whether the measurement of the produced energy has been carried out directly or obtained through third parties.
    b) The Market Operator will directly provide each river basin authority with the data referring to the hourly price of the daily market of the period subject to the levy.
    c) In the same way, the body in charge of the settlements of the specific or additional remuneration regime that corresponds according to the regulations of the electricity sector, will directly provide the river basin authority with the documented information of the payments that must be settled to these hydroelectric facilities. This information will be provided before March 15 and will correspond to the expired calendar year.
6.  The annual tax rate will be 25.5 percent of the value of the taxable base and the full tax liability will be the amount resulting from applying the tax rate to the taxable base.
7.  Hydroelectric uses operated directly by the General State Administration or its competent public bodies in the management of the public hydraulic domain in the inter-community basins will be exempt from the payment of this levy.
8.  The levy will be reduced by 92 percent for hydroelectric facilities with a power equal to or less than 50 MW, and by 90 percent for pumping facilities with a power greater than 50 MW, on the part of the taxable base composed of the value of the energy from pumping, in the manner determined by regulation for those productions or facilities that should be incentivized for reasons of general energy policy. The reduction will not be applicable to the part of the taxable base composed of the value of the energy from direct turbination from the reservoir.
9.  Regarding the management of the levy:
    a) The tax period of the levy will coincide with the calendar year, or the fraction of the year elapsed since the initial granting of the concession or its extinction.
    b) The self-assessment and payment will be made in the month of March of each calendar year, with the taxpayer being obliged to self-assess the levy and pay the corresponding tax liability for the calendar year prior to the object of having been able to have for its calculation the definitive measurements of the electrical production. The first year, as well as the last in which the self-assessment must be made, will be for the proportional part corresponding to the period of validity of the concession during that year.
    c) The management and collection of the levy will correspond to the competent River Basin Authority or to the State Tax Administration, by virtue of an agreement with it.
    In case of celebrating the agreement with the State Tax Administration Agency, it will receive from the River Basin Authority the relevant data and censuses that facilitate its management, and will periodically inform it in the manner established in the Agreement, according to the information obligations established in section 5 of this article.
    d) 50 percent of the collected levy will be considered an income of the River Basin Authority, and will be destined to finance control activities, quality improvement, procedures and protection of the Public Hydraulic Domain that will be defined by regulation. The remaining 50 percent will be destined to finance the costs of the electrical system provided for in Law 24/2013, of December 26, of the electricity sector, referring to the promotion of renewable energies.

**Article 113. Discharge control levy.**

1.  Discharges into the public hydraulic domain shall be taxed with a fee intended for the study, control, protection and improvement of the receiving environment of each river basin, which shall be called the discharge control levy.
2.  Taxpayers of the discharge control levy shall be those who carry out the discharge.
3.  The amount of the discharge control levy shall be the product of the authorized discharge volume multiplied by the unit price of discharge control. This unit price shall be calculated by multiplying the basic price per cubic meter by a coefficient of increase or decrease, which shall be established by regulation according to the nature, characteristics and degree of pollution of the discharge, as well as the higher environmental quality of the physical environment into which it is discharged.
    The volume of water that has been effectively reused during the tax period shall be deducted from the calculation of the amount of the discharge control levy.
    The basic price per cubic meter is set at 0.01751 euros for urban wastewater and 0.04377 euros for industrial wastewater. These basic prices may be revised periodically in the General State Budget Laws.
    The coefficient of increase of the basic price may not be greater than 5.
4.  The discharge control levy shall accrue on December 31, with the tax period coinciding with a calendar year, except for the year in which the discharge authorization or its cessation occurs, in which case, the levy shall be calculated proportionally to the number of days of validity of the authorization in relation to the total for the year. During the first quarter of each calendar year, the levy corresponding to the previous year shall be settled.
5.  In the case of inter-community basins, this levy shall be collected by the River Basin Authority or by the State Tax Administration, by virtue of an agreement with it. In this second case, the State Tax Administration Agency will receive from the River Basin Authority the relevant data and censuses that facilitate its management, and will periodically inform it in the manner determined by regulation. The collected levy will be made available to the corresponding River Basin Authority.
    Likewise, by virtue of an agreement, the Autonomous Communities may collect the levy in their territorial area. In this case, the Autonomous Community will make available to the River Basin Authority the amount stipulated in the agreement, in attention to the functions that by virtue of it are entrusted to the Autonomous Community.
6.  When the existence of a discharge is proven, whose responsible party lacks the administrative authorization referred to in article 100, regardless of the corresponding sanction, the River Basin Authority will settle the discharge control levy for the non-prescribed years, calculating its amount by indirect estimation procedures in accordance with what is established by regulation.
7.  The discharge control levy shall be independent of the levies or fees that may be established by the Autonomous Communities or Local Corporations to finance the works of sanitation and purification.
8.  When a taxpayer of the discharge control levy is obliged to pay any other tax linked to the protection, improvement and control of the receiving environment established by the Autonomous Communities in the exercise of their powers, the amount corresponding to this tax may be deducted or reduced from the amount to be paid as a discharge control levy.
    With the object of arbitrating the necessary mechanisms to achieve the effective correspondence between the services received and the amounts to be paid by the taxpayer of the cited taxes, the Ministry of the Environment and the involved autonomous Administrations will sign the appropriate collaboration agreements.

**Article 114. Regulation levy and water use tariff.**

1.  Those benefited by the regulation works of surface or groundwater, financed totally or partially by the State, shall pay a regulation levy intended to compensate for the costs of the investment borne by the state Administration and to meet the costs of operation and conservation of such works.
    The beneficiaries may be so directly or indirectly. Direct beneficiaries will be those who obtain an improvement in the guarantee of supply through the use of the hydraulic regulation works. Indirect beneficiaries will be those who, by causing effects on the surface and groundwater bodies, benefit from the effects of the hydraulic regulation works, even if they are not direct users of them.
2.  Those benefited by other specific hydraulic works financed totally or partially by the State, including those for the correction of the deterioration of the public hydraulic domain, derived from its use, shall pay for the availability or use of the water, as well as for the deterioration of its quality, a levy called "water use tariff", intended to compensate for the investment costs borne by the state Administration and to meet the costs of operation and conservation of such works. The works that are not for the regulation of surface or groundwater and belong to any of the categories listed in article 122.1 and 2 of this law shall be considered specific; in particular, the works intended for desalination, supply, sanitation, purification and reuse shall be understood as specific.
    In the situations provided for in section 1 of article 109 quinquies, the user who carries out the substitution with reclaimed waters may be exempted from the additional costs that the change of water supply source entails, involving the corresponding concession modification.
3.  The amount of each of the levies shall be fixed, for each budgetary year, by summing the following amounts:
    a) The total foreseen operating and conservation expenses of the works carried out.
    b) The administration expenses of the managing body attributable to said works.
    c) 4 percent of the value of the investments made by the State, duly updated, taking into account the technical amortization of the works and facilities and the depreciation of the currency, in the manner determined by regulation.
4.  The individual distribution of said total amount, among all the beneficiaries of the works, shall be carried out according to criteria of rationalization of water use, equity in the distribution of obligations and self-financing of the service, in the manner determined by regulation.
5.  In the case of inter-community basins, the levies provided for in this article shall be managed and collected by the River Basin Authority or by the State Tax Administration, by virtue of an agreement with it. In this second case, the State Tax Administration Agency will receive from the River Basin Authority the relevant data and censuses that facilitate its management, and will periodically inform it in the manner determined by regulation. The collected levy will be made available to the corresponding River Basin Authority.
6.  The body that settles the levies and exactions shall introduce a correction factor to the amount to be paid, depending on whether the beneficiary of the hydraulic work consumes in quantities greater or less than the reference allocations fixed in the River Basin Hydrological Plans or, where appropriate, in the regulations that regulate the respective sectoral planning, especially in matters of irrigation or other agricultural uses. This correction factor shall consist of a coefficient to be applied to the settlement, which may not be greater than 2 nor less than 0.5, in accordance with the rules determined by regulation.
7.  The River Basin Authority, in accordance with the provisions of this article, shall determine the annual amounts of the regulation levy and the water use tariff before the beginning of the year to which they apply, and may collect them from the beginning of the calendar year in which it is applicable until the last day of the first semester of the following year.

**Article 115. Economic-administrative nature of the settlements.**

1.  The self-assessment of the levies or exactions mentioned in the previous articles may be established by regulation.
2.  The acts of approval and settlement of these levies or exactions shall have an economic-administrative character. Without prejudice to the provisions of the rules regulating the applicable procedures, the challenge of the acts shall not suspend their effectiveness, with the payment of the debit being enforceable through the administrative enforcement procedure. Non-payment may lead to the suspension or loss of the right to the use or exploitation of the public hydraulic domain.
3.  The payment of the levies provided for in this Law, when those obliged to do so are grouped in a user community or representative organization of the same, may be made through such communities or entities, which are empowered for this purpose to carry out the corresponding collection, in the terms established by regulation.

**TITLE VII**
**On infringements and sanctions and the jurisdiction of the Courts**

**Article 116. Actions constituting an infringement.**

1.  The non-compliance with the provisions of this Law shall be sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of this Title and in Title IX of Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and the Common Administrative Procedure.

    i) The non-presentation of a responsible declaration or the non-compliance with the provisions contained in the responsible declaration for the exercise of a specific activity or with the conditions imposed by the Administration for the exercise thereof.
    j) The inaccuracy, falsehood, or omission in the data, manifestations, or documents that are incorporated or accompany the responsible declaration.
    The following natural or legal persons shall incur liability for the infringement of paragraphs b) and h): The owner of the land, the promoter of the abstraction, the entrepreneur who executes the work, and the technical director thereof.

**Article 117. Classification of infringements.**

1.  The cited infringements shall be classified by regulation as minor, less serious, serious, or very serious, according to their repercussion on the order and use of the public hydraulic domain, their significance with respect to the safety of persons and property and the circumstances of the responsible party, their degree of malice, participation and benefit obtained, as well as the deterioration produced in the quality of the resource, and may be sanctioned with the following fines:
    Minor infringements, fine of up to 10,000.00 euros.
    Less serious infringements, fine of 10,000.01 to 50,000.00 euros.
    Serious infringements, fine of 50,000.01 to 500,000.00 euros.
    Very serious infringements, fine of 500,000.01 to 1,000,000.00 euros.
2.  In general, for the valuation of the damage to the public hydraulic domain and the hydraulic works, their economic value shall be weighed. In the case of damages to the quality of the water, the cost of the treatment that would have been necessary to avoid the contamination caused by the discharge and its dangerousness shall be taken into account. All of this, in accordance with what is established by regulation.
3.  The sanction for minor and less serious infringements shall correspond to the River Basin Authority. In relation to the former, a summary and abbreviated procedure shall be established by regulation, respecting the principles established in chapter II of Title IX of Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and the Common Administrative Procedure. The sanction for serious infringements shall be the competence of the Minister of the Environment, and the imposition of fines for very serious infringements shall be reserved for the Council of Ministers.
4.  The Government may, by means of a Decree, proceed to update the amount of the sanctions, provided for in section 1 of this article.

**Article 118. Indemnifications for damages and losses to the public hydraulic domain.**

1.  Regardless of the sanctions imposed on them, the offenders may be obliged to repair the damages and losses caused to the public hydraulic domain, as well as to restore things to their previous state. The sanctioning body shall executively fix the indemnifications that proceed.
2.  Both the amount of the sanctions and that of the responsibilities that may arise may be enforced through the administrative enforcement procedure.

**Article 119. Coercive fines.**

1.  The sanctioning bodies may impose coercive fines in the cases contemplated in the Law on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and the Common Administrative Procedure. The amount of each fine shall not exceed, in any case, 10 percent of the maximum fine set for the infringement committed.
2.  To guarantee the effectiveness of the final resolution that may be issued, precautionary measures may be adopted, on a provisional basis, that are necessary to avoid the continuation of the infringing activity, such as the sealing of facilities, apparatus, equipment, and wells, and the cessation of activities.

**Article 120. Infringements constituting a crime or offense.**

In cases where the infringements could be constitutive of a crime or offense, the Administration shall transfer the matter to the competent jurisdiction and shall refrain from continuing the sanctioning procedure while the judicial authority has not ruled. The sanction of the judicial authority shall exclude the imposition of an administrative fine. If the existence of a crime or offense has not been deemed to exist, the Administration may continue the sanctioning file based on the facts that the Courts have considered proven.

**Article 121. Competent jurisdiction.**

For the purposes of this Law, a hydraulic work is understood as the construction of assets that have an immovable nature intended for the abstraction, extraction, desalination, storage, regulation, conduction, control and use of waters, as well as the sanitation, purification, treatment and reuse of the used waters and those that have as their object the artificial recharge of aquifers, the action on channels, the correction of the regime of currents and the protection against floods, such as dams, reservoirs, canals of ditches, weirs, conduits, and supply depots to populations, desalination, abstraction and pumping facilities, sewerage, collectors of rainwater and wastewater, sanitation, purification and treatment facilities, gauging stations, piezometers, quality control networks, dikes and channeling and defense works against floods, as well as those necessary actions for the protection of the public hydraulic domain.
2.  It will be understood that the facilities, constructive elements or equipment that allow optimizing the operation and exploitation of the hydraulic works that are projected in the future, or that are under construction or already built, are an inseparable part of the hydraulic works mentioned in section 1, with the aim of obtaining a reduction in the costs of operation and exploitation, greater energy efficiency, or the production of electrical energy intended for the operation of the cited hydraulic infrastructures.
3.  For the actions declared of general interest by the General State Administration that are under construction or already built, the necessary works projects for the facilities, constructive elements or equipment cited in section 2 of this article, will have the character of complementary, regardless of whether they are executed directly by the General State Administration, by its autonomous Bodies or through the State Water Companies regulated in article 132 of this law.

**Article 123. Legal regime of the hydraulic work.**

1.  Hydraulic works can be of public or private ownership.
    The construction of a hydraulic work that involves the concession of new water uses cannot be initiated without previously obtaining or declaring the corresponding concession, authorization or public domain reservation, except in the case of a declaration of emergency or extreme hydrological situations.
    For hydraulic works linked to energy uses, the provisions of Law 54/1997, of November 27, of the Electricity Sector, will also be applicable.
2.  Public hydraulic works are those intended to guarantee the protection, control and use of continental waters and the public hydraulic domain and which are the competence of the General State Administration, the Hydrographic Confederations, the Autonomous Communities and the Local Entities.

**Article 123 bis. Safety of dams and reservoirs.**

With the aim of protecting people, the environment and property, the Government will regulate by Royal Decree the essential safety conditions that dams and reservoirs must meet, establishing the obligations and responsibilities of their owners, the safety control procedures, and the functions that correspond to the public Administration.

**Article 124. Competences for the execution, management and exploitation of public hydraulic works.**

1.  Public hydraulic works of general interest are the competence of the General State Administration.
