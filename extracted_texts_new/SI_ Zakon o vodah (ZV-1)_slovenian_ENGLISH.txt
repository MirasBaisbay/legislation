Article 56 (Exemptions) (1) In fulfilling the objectives relating to the achievement of good status or good ecological potential of water bodies, the Government may, for an individual water body, determine that: 1. the deadlines for achieving the objectives be extended because their achievement within a certain period is not possible for reasons related to technical feasibility or disproportionately high costs or natural conditions, 2. individual less stringent environmental objectives be set if the water body is so heavily modified by human activity or natural conditions that achieving the objectives would be unfeasible or associated with disproportionately high costs. (2) It shall be considered that the obligation to meet the objectives relating to the achievement of good status or good ecological potential of a water body has not been breached if there has been a temporary deterioration in the status of the water body due to a natural disaster or force majeure that could not have been foreseen. (3) The Government may, for an individual water body, determine that the objectives of achieving good status, good ecological potential or preventing the deterioration of the status of water bodies are not met if the deterioration is due to physical changes in the water body as a result of a new human activity, or that the objective of preventing the deterioration of the status of a surface water body from very good to good status is not met due to a new sustainable development activity, and if: 1. a public interest has been demonstrated by an act or a national programme or another act adopted on the basis thereof, and the benefits of the new modifications or changes for human health and safety or sustainable development are greater than the benefits of achieving the objectives for the environment and society, 2. it is evident from the act or a national programme or another act adopted on the basis thereof, or from a strategic environmental assessment of that act, that the beneficial objectives achieved by the physical changes in the water body cannot, due to technical unfeasibility or disproportionate costs, be achieved in a way that would have less adverse consequences for the environment, 3. it is ensured by a national spatial plan or another act and a strategic environmental assessment of that act that technically feasible and proportionate measures are implemented to mitigate the adverse effects on the status of waters, and 4. it is ensured by an act and a national programme or another act adopted on the basis thereof, a national spatial plan or a strategic environmental assessment of that act that the requirement from the fourth paragraph of this Article is met. (4) The reasons for the changes referred to in the preceding paragraph must be specifically stated and justified in the national spatial plan or another act referred to in the preceding paragraph and summarised in the water management plan referred to in the preceding Article. (5) The granting of exemptions for an individual water body must not jeopardise the achievement of the objectives relating to good status or good ecological potential of waters in other water bodies within the same river basin district for which no exemption has been granted. (6) The Government shall prescribe more detailed conditions for determining or establishing the exemptions referred to in this Article. Article 57 (Programme of measures) (1) For the implementation of the objectives defined in the national programme and the water management plans for river basin districts, the Government shall adopt a programme of measures.
