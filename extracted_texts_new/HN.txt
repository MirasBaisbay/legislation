GENERAL WATER LAW

Monday, August 24, 2009

DECREE NO. 181-2009

THE NATIONAL CONGRESS:

WHEREAS: Water is the most important element for the existence and development of human activities, and access to it is linked to the development and well-being of people.

WHEREAS: Water management has a profound influence on governance and human coexistence. Water can be associated not only with internal social crises but also with international relations.

WHEREAS: The legal framework related to the general water regime dates from 1927, and its content, in addition to being oriented toward specific applications, sets forth legal conditions that are completely outdated, necessitating a new framework that aligns with the country's current legal, social, economic, and environmental reality.

WHEREAS: The Constitution declares the technical and rational exploitation of natural resources to be of public utility and necessity, and the Land Use Planning Law, in turn, designates it as an area of special intervention.

WHEREAS: The natural resources in ecosystems provide us with the service of capturing and retaining water resources, which in turn allows us to use water to satisfy basic needs, as a means of transport, as an input for agricultural and hydroelectric production, as a good for commercial exchange, as an attribute for tourism development, and even as a sink for domestic and industrial waste.

THEREFORE:

DECREES:

The following:
