Chapter II Public Hydraulic Domain Section One. Constitution and Delimitation of the Public Hydraulic Domain Article 4 The public hydraulic domain is inalienable, unseizable, and imprescriptible. The right to use the public hydraulic domain is granted under the conditions set forth by this Law and the texts issued for its application. Article 5 The public hydraulic domain consists of all inland waters, whether surface or underground, fresh, brackish, saline, mineral, or waste, as well as desalinated seawater discharged into the public hydraulic domain, and hydraulic works and their appurtenances assigned to public use. Accordingly, the following form part of this domain: a) natural water bodies such as lakes, ponds, lagoons, salt marshes, and marshes of all kinds that do not communicate directly with the sea, as well as their land bases and freeboards with a width of two (2) meters. Parcels that, without being permanently covered by water and due to their water potential, are not suitable for agricultural use in an ordinary agricultural year shall be considered part of this category; b) springs of all natures, including freshwater resurgences at sea; c) watercourses of all kinds, whether natural or artificial, permanent or non-permanent, as well as their beds, their sources and mouths, and the beds of torrents or gullies or *chaâbas* in which the flow of water leaves visible traces; 1484 OFFICIAL BULLETIN d) the banks of watercourses up to the level reached by the water before overflowing and, furthermore, in the parts of watercourses subject to tidal influence, all surfaces covered by tides with a coefficient of 120; e) freeboards measured from the limits of the banks: 1- with a width of six (6) meters on the following watercourses or sections of watercourses: the Moulouya from its mouth to its sources, the Sebou from its mouth to its sources, the Loukkos from its mouth to its sources, the Oum Er-Rbia from its mouth to its sources, and the Bou Regreg from its mouth to the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah dam. Port facilities existing at the mouths of these watercourses on the date of publication of this Law in the "Official Bulletin" are excluded from the public hydraulic domain; 2- with a width of two meters on other watercourses or sections of watercourses. f) alluvium, sand, rocks, and all kinds of deposits that form, and vegetation that grows naturally in the beds of watercourses, water bodies in general, their banks, and their freeboards; g) hydraulic works consisting, in particular, of: 1- artesian wells and boreholes, public wells and watering troughs, as well as, where applicable, their immediate protection perimeters for which the land has been lawfully acquired; 2- irrigation or drainage channels assigned to public use, as well as the lawfully acquired lands included in their freeboards; 3- dikes and dams, as well as their reservoirs, aqueducts, pipelines, water conduits, and *seguias* (traditional irrigation channels) assigned to public use. Article 6 If, for natural causes, a modification of the bed of a watercourse has occurred, the limits of the freeboards shall shift according to the width set in paragraph (e) of Article 5 above, parallel to the new bed. In the event of an advance of the waters, the area between the old and new freeboard limits shall be incorporated, by right, into the public hydraulic domain, with appropriate compensation for the submerged lands, determined according to the procedures applied for expropriation for public utility, for the benefit of the riparian owner, who shall have the right to remove any works and installations established by him as well as any standing crops. In the event of a retreat of the waters, the said area shall be returned free of charge to the riparian owner if he proves to have been its owner before it was covered by water, all subject to compliance with the easements resulting or that may result from laws or customs. Article 7 The new bed that a watercourse may naturally create, along with its associated freeboards, shall be incorporated into the public hydraulic domain. No. 6506—4 Muharram 1438 (6-10-2016) If the old bed is not entirely abandoned by the waters, the owners of the lands crossed by the new bed have the right to request from the Administration appropriate compensation, determined according to the procedures applied for expropriation for public utility. If the old bed is entirely abandoned by the waters, the owners are entitled to the following compensation: -- when the abandoned bed and the new bed both run across a single property, the former bed and its freeboards shall be declassified and attributed free of charge to the owner of that property; -- when the two beds, old and new, cross lands belonging to different owners, the old bed and its freeboards shall be declassified from the public hydraulic domain, and the riparian owners may acquire ownership thereof by right of preemption, each for their respective side up to the centerline of the old bed. The price of the old bed shall be determined by experts appointed by the president of the competent court at the request of the Administration. If the riparian owners of the old bed fail to declare, within three months of the notification sent to them by the Administration, their intention to acquire it at the price set by the experts, the said bed shall be alienated according to the rules governing the alienation of the State's private domain. The proceeds from the sale shall be distributed as compensation to the owners of the lands occupied by the new watercourse, in proportion to the value of the land taken from each of them. If the sale operation mentioned in the preceding paragraph is unsuccessful, the owners of the lands occupied by the new bed shall be compensated by amicable agreement or, failing that, by a judgment of the competent court. Article 8 Assets of the public hydraulic domain that, due to natural causes or as a result of correction or diversion works on watercourses authorized in accordance with the provisions of Section One of Chapter III of this Law, have lost their public utility shall be declassified by decree. The parcels of land on which the correction or diversion works indicated in the first paragraph of this article were carried out shall be incorporated into the public hydraulic domain. The procedures for the application of this article shall be determined by regulation. Article 9 The freeboards of the public hydraulic domain shall be delimited by decree after a public inquiry conducted by a special commission tasked with collecting objections or claims from interested third parties. To this end, the draft delimitation must be brought to the public's attention by all means of publicity as set forth in Article 8 of Law No. 7-81 on expropriation for public utility No. 6506—4 Muharram 1438 (6-10-2016) OFFICIAL BULLETIN and on temporary occupation, at least 30 days before the start of this inquiry, the duration of which must not exceed 60 days. The composition of the special commission and the procedure for this delimitation shall be determined by regulation. Section 2. Recognized Private Rights to Water Article 10 Lawfully recognized water rights are subject to the provisions of the integrated water resources management master plans as provided for in Chapter VII of this Law. The holders of these water rights may not be dispossessed of them except through expropriation under the conditions provided for by Law No. 7-81 on expropriation for public utility and on temporary occupation. Article 11 Water used for the irrigation of a specific parcel of land and belonging to the owner or operator of said land shall be transferred either at the same time as the land and always for the benefit of the latter, or separately from this land, provided that the purchaser is the owner or operator of an agricultural parcel to which these water rights will be attached and that he does not hold other water rights sufficient to cover the water needs of that parcel. In the event of the subdivision of the land, the provisions of Article 13 below shall apply. Article 12 Holders of lawfully recognized rights to water that they do not use in whole or in part for their lands must transfer, in whole or in part, the unused rights to natural or legal persons who own agricultural land and for the benefit of said land. Water rights for which the owners have not initiated any transfer procedure in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph above shall be subject to expropriation for the benefit of the State under the conditions defined by the aforementioned Law No. 7-81. Article 13 Any transfer or lease of agricultural land that uses, for its irrigation, water over which rights are lawfully recognized to third parties may only be carried out if the owner of said land submits to the purchaser or lessee a water lease contract established in their name, guaranteeing them a fixed term and specifying the price and the water they need for the irrigation of said land. Section 3. Rights and Obligations of Landowners Article 14 Subject to the provisions of Chapter III of this Law, any owner or operator of land may be authorized to dig one or more wells or construct one or more boreholes on their land for the abstraction of water. They also have the right to use this water, subject to the duly established rights of third parties. Article 15 1485 Any owner or operator of land who wishes to collect rainwater or use water from the public hydraulic domain available to them has the right to obtain passage for it over intervening lands, within the framework of the right of easement, in exchange for fair and prior compensation. In the absence of an amicable agreement between the parties concerned, this compensation shall be determined by the competent court. However, the owners of the intervening lands, should they waive compensation, may, after obtaining an authorization to use water from the public hydraulic domain, benefit from the works carried out for the passage of said water, in exchange for a financial contribution to the works carried out or to be carried out and to the maintenance of the jointly used facilities. Subject to the provisions of the code of real rights, landowners must receive the water that may flow from the lands thus irrigated, with compensation if applicable. Houses, courtyards, gardens, parks, and enclosures adjoining dwellings whose existence precedes the establishment of the owner's right are exempt from this easement. Article 16 Any owner or operator of land who wishes to drain water that is harmful to their land has the right to obtain passage for it over intervening lands under the same conditions as those set forth in Article 15 above. However, the owners or operators of the lands crossed may use the works carried out for this purpose for the drainage of water from their own lands, subject to a financial contribution, determined by mutual agreement, to the works carried out or to be carried out, as well as to the maintenance of the jointly used installations. Article 17 Properties riparian to watercourses, lakes, aqueducts, water conduits, and irrigation or drainage channels assigned to public use are subject to an easement within a width that may reach, where applicable, four meters from the freeboards, intended to allow free passage for personnel and equipment of the Administration, competent public establishments, and third parties, as well as the deposit of dredged materials or the execution of works of general interest. This easement obliges riparian owners to refrain from any act likely to harm the easement area and the functioning, maintenance, and conservation of watercourses, lakes, and hydraulic works. In the event that this easement results in the non-use of effectively developed parcels, the owners have the right to request the expropriation or acquisition of said parcels by the State. Where the easement area proves insufficient for the establishment of a path, the Administration or the competent public establishment may, in the absence of an amicable agreement with the riparian owners, acquire the necessary land through expropriation. 1486 Article 18 OFFICIAL BULLETIN The execution of the works referred to in Article 17 above on lands subject to an easement must be notified in writing with acknowledgement of receipt to the owners or operators of said lands at least 45 days before the start of the works. Any damage resulting from this execution shall be determined, in the absence of an amicable agreement, by the competent court. Article 19 Any owner of land burdened by a deposit easement lasting more than one year has the right, at any time during the entire duration of the easement, to require the beneficiary of this easement to acquire said land. If this request is not complied with within a period of one year, the owner may apply to the competent courts for a judgment ordering the transfer of ownership and determining the amount of compensation. Article 20 In the absence of prior authorization, the Administration may proceed ex officio, at the expense of the offenders, with the demolition of any new construction or any raising of a fixed fence, as well as the felling of any plantation within the areas subject to easement if no action is taken by the interested parties in response to the formal notice sent to them, with acknowledgement of receipt, to carry out these operations within a period that may not be less than 30 days from the date of its notification. If necessary, the Administration may request, in exchange for compensation, the felling of trees or the cutting of their branches and the demolition of existing constructions within the limits of these areas. It may proceed ex officio if no action has been taken on its request within a period of three months from the date of receipt of said request. Article 21 The State, territorial collectivities, river basin agencies, and duly authorized concessionaires have the right, in accordance with the provisions of this Law, to carry out water exploration works on private properties in accordance with the provisions of the law on expropriation for public utility and on temporary occupation. Article 22 The State and territorial collectivities, as well as public establishments acting on their behalf, have the right, after obtaining the concurring opinion of the river basin agency concerned, to carry out general interest infrastructure works on the public hydraulic domain, taking into account the duly established rights of third parties. Chapter III Use and Exploitation of the Public Hydraulic Domain Article 23 Any use or exploitation of the public hydraulic domain, in any manner whatsoever, must be carried out in accordance with the conditions and procedures set forth by this Law and the texts issued for its application. It may not be authorized if it is likely to cause prejudice No. 6506—4 Muharram 1438 (6-10-2016) to the public hydraulic domain, particularly to hydraulic works, the stability of watercourse banks, the free flow of water, and the aquatic environment. Water quality standards shall be determined by regulation according to the use for which the water is intended. Section One. - Authorizations and Concessions Article 24 The authorizations and concessions relating to the public hydraulic domain, referred to in this section, are granted, based on the availability of resources from the public hydraulic domain, after a public inquiry. These authorizations and concessions give rise to the payment of fees for the processing of the related applications. The public inquiry mentioned above is conducted by a special commission tasked with collecting the observations and objections of interested third parties. To this end, the application for authorization or concession must be brought to the public's attention by posting or any appropriate means of publicity, including written and electronic, local or national, 15 days before the start date of this inquiry, the duration of which may not exceed 30 days. The river basin agency is required to rule on the application for authorization or concession, based on the reasoned opinion of the said commission on the observations and objections of third parties, within a period of 7 working days from the date of receipt of the minutes of this commission. The composition of the public inquiry commission and the procedures for granting the aforementioned authorizations and concessions shall be determined by regulation. The operations listed in paragraphs 6 to 10 of Article 28 below are not subject to a public inquiry. Article 25 Any authorization or concession for the use or exploitation of the public hydraulic domain may only be granted if it is compatible with the orientations and objectives of the integrated water resources management master plan, where one exists. The said authorization or concession shall take into account, where applicable, the requirements of the protected areas management plan, where one exists. Article 26 Authorizations or concessions relating to the digging of wells, the construction of boreholes, and the abstraction of groundwater must take into account the provisions of the safeguard or prohibition perimeters delimited by virtue of Articles 111, 112, and 113 below and the provisions of the participatory management contract established by virtue of Article 115 of this Law. Article 27 Any exploitation or use of the public hydraulic domain is subject to the payment of a fee in accordance with the conditions set forth by this Law.

Article 29 Within urban perimeters, the authorizations provided for in paragraphs 1, 6, and 9 of Article 28 above are issued by the river basin agency after obtaining the opinion of the president of the communal council concerned. For authorizations relating to paragraph 1, the river basin agency is required to request this opinion before launching the public inquiry procedure. This opinion must be notified to the river basin agency within a period of twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by the commune of the request for an opinion. After this period, the opinion of the president of the communal council is deemed favorable. Article 30 When the use of the public hydraulic domain requires or is, by virtue of this Law and the texts issued for its application, subject to several authorizations or concessions, a single authorization or concession shall be issued, which shall specify all the conditions that would have been set separately by all the other authorizations or concessions. In this case, the applicant for the authorizations or concessions shall submit a single file containing the elements and documents required for the issuance of the said authorization or concession. The procedures for the application of this article shall be determined by regulation. Article 31 The authorization, provided for in Article 24 above, is granted by the river basin agency, subject to the duly acquired rights of third parties. It may confer upon the beneficiary the right to temporarily occupy the parts of the public hydraulic domain necessary for the authorized installations or operations. The authorization decision shall specify, in particular: -- the flow rate, volume, or area to be used or exploited; -- the duration of the authorization, which must not exceed ten (10) years and which may be extended; -- the conditions of exploitation as well as the measures to be taken by the holder of the authorization in application of the provisions of this Law and the texts issued for its application; -- the measures to be taken by the recipient of the authorization to prevent the degradation of the public hydraulic domain that he uses or exploits; -- the methods and means of monitoring by the recipient of the authorization, as well as the procedures for controlling the use or exploitation of the public hydraulic domain subject to the authorization; -- the procedures for equipping the water abstraction installation with a meter and the conditions for its maintenance and repair, particularly when the abstraction is carried out by pumping; 1488 OFFICIAL BULLETIN No. 6506—4 Muharram 1438 (6-10-2016) -- the deadlines for declaring the volumes of water or materials exploited and the method of calculation and procedures for payment of the fee and the surcharges to be applied if the fee is not paid by the established deadlines. Article 32 The authorization shall be revoked by the river basin agency, without compensation, after a formal notice sent with acknowledgement of receipt to the interested party has remained without effect for a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of this formal notice, if: -- the conditions it contains are not observed; -- the authorization has not begun to be exploited within a period of 2 years from the date of its notification to its beneficiary; -- the transfer of the authorization is carried out without the prior agreement of the river basin agency, except for the exception provided for in the 2nd paragraph of Article 43 of this Law. The agency must rule on the request for agreement to the transfer of the authorization within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of this request; -- the fees to be paid and the late payment penalties are not paid by the established deadlines; -- the public hydraulic domain is used for a purpose other than that authorized; -- the use or exploitation exceeds the authorized volumes of water, materials, or areas; -- the water becomes polluted and does not conform to established standards; -- the rights of third parties guaranteed by law are infringed. The river basin agency may, at any time, modify, amend, or revoke the authorization or reduce its duration for reasons of general interest, subject to prior notice sent to the beneficiary with acknowledgement of receipt. The agency may only proceed with one of the aforementioned measures after the expiration of a period of thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by the recipient of the aforementioned prior notice. This modification, amendment, revocation, or reduction gives rise to a right to compensation for the benefit of the authorization holder if he suffers direct prejudice therefrom. This compensation shall, in the absence of an amicable agreement, be determined by the competent court. In the event that the general interest that prevailed in the modification, amendment, revocation, or reduction of the duration of the authorization no longer exists, priority regarding the use or exploitation of the public hydraulic domain shall be granted to the initial recipient of the authorization under the conditions and procedures set forth by this Law and the texts issued for its application. Article 33 The following are subject to the concession regime, in particular: 1) the development of natural mineral or thermal springs, as well as the abstraction of spring water, whatever its nature, for the purpose of bottling and marketing it or if the flow rate to be abstracted is greater than the threshold set by regulation; 2) the establishment on the public hydraulic domain, for a duration of more than 10 years, of works, including dams, intended for the storage or diversion of water for its use, particularly for the production of hydroelectric energy or other purposes; 3) the development of lakes, ponds, sebkhas (salt flats), and marshes; 4) the use of natural or artificial water bodies for the exercise of aquaculture, leisure, tourism, or sports activities; 5) water abstractions when they are intended for the public supply of drinking water; 6) water intakes on watercourses, dams, or canals for the purpose of producing hydroelectric energy; 7) the exploitation and management of public hydraulic works such as dams and water transfer pipelines; 8) the capture of freshwater resurgences at sea. The concession constitutes real rights of limited duration that do not confer upon its holder any right of ownership over the public hydraulic domain. The concession regime does not apply to the abstraction of water resources for agricultural use within perimeters developed in part or in whole by the State, in particular, the perimeters delimited within the meaning of Article 6 of Dahir No. 1-69-25 of 10 Jumada I 1389 (25 July 1969) forming the agricultural investment code as it has been modified and supplemented. Article 34 The river basin agency shall draw up the concession contract, which shall specify, in particular: -- the flow rate, volume, or area granted, according to the use; -- the use and method of exploitation or utilization of the water or the granted area; -- the procedures for payment, by the beneficiary of the concession, of the fee and the surcharges applicable in the event that the fee is not paid by the established deadlines; -- the duration of the concession, which may not exceed 30 years and which may be extended; -- the nature of the works, the deadline, and the procedures for carrying out the planned installations and developments; -- the measures to be taken by the concessionaire regarding the works and installations to be carried out in application of the concession contract in general, in particular, the works indicated in paragraph 2 of Article 33 above, in order to preserve water resources, the rights of third parties, and the aquatic fauna and flora downstream of said works; No. 6506—4 Muharram 1438 (6-10-2016) OFFICIAL BULLETIN -- the conditions under which the concession contract may be revised, in particular, the modification of the granted flow rate or area, as well as the compensation to which the modification of the flow rate or area may give rise; -- the procedures for monitoring by the concessionaire of the use or exploitation of the granted public hydraulic domain, as well as the procedures for controlling this use or exploitation; -- the conditions for the buyout and forfeiture of the concession by the river basin agency, as well as those for the return of the works to the State at the end of the concession; -- the conditions for returning the site to its initial state or, failing that, to an ecologically acceptable state, or for carrying out rehabilitation works at the end of the concession contract. Article 35 Without prejudice to the specific clauses appearing in the concession contract, the forfeiture of the concession may be declared, if no action has been taken within a specified period in response to a formal notice sent to the concessionaire, in the following cases: -- exceeding, according to the use, the granted flow rate, volume, or area by more than 10%; -- use of the water or the granted area for a purpose other than that authorized or outside the fixed area of use; -- non-payment of fees and late payment surcharges by the established deadlines; -- non-use of the granted water or area within the time limits set in the concession contract; -- transfer of the concession to another party without the prior agreement of the river basin agency, subject to the 2nd paragraph of Article 44 of this Law; -- non-compliance with obligations of a sanitary nature, particularly in the case of natural mineral or thermal water sources; -- damage to the ecological balance of the environments linked to the site subject to the concession. In the event of forfeiture of the concession, the river basin agency may order the site to be returned to its initial state or, failing that, to an ecologically acceptable state, or, if necessary, proceed to do so ex officio at the expense of the dispossessed concessionaire. Article 36 The concession may not be assigned to a third party without the prior agreement of the river basin agency. This agency is required to rule on the request for assignment within a period of 30 days from the date of its receipt. The rights and obligations of the concession are transferred, by right, to the person to whom the concession has been assigned. Article 37 The river basin agency may, when it deems it useful, resort to a call for competition to grant a concession for the use of the public hydraulic domain. 1489 The types of use subject to a call for competition, as well as the forms and procedures for resorting to it, shall be determined by regulation. Article 38 Any refusal of an authorization or concession must be reasoned and notified to the applicant by the river basin agency within a period of fifteen (15) days, if: -- the agency decides, after a preliminary examination, not to launch the public inquiry procedure provided for in Article 24 above. This period begins to run from the date of receipt of the application; -- the opinion of the special commission provided for in Article 24 above is unfavorable. This period begins to run from the date of receipt of this opinion.
