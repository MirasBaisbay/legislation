SETS FORTH THE TEXT OF THE WATER CODE

Santiago, August 13, 1981.- Today, the following was decreed:

D.F.L. No. 1,122.- Whereas: The authority granted to me by Article 2 of Decree Law No. 2,603 of 1979, extended by Decree Law 3,337 of 1980, and renewed by Decree Law 3,549 of 1981, I hereby issue the following

Decree with force of law:

BOOK ONE

OF WATERS AND WATER USE RIGHTS

Title I

GENERAL PROVISIONS

ARTICLE 1.- Waters are divided into maritime and terrestrial. The provisions of this Code apply only to terrestrial waters.

Rainwater is that which comes directly from rainfall, and it shall be classified as maritime or terrestrial depending on where it falls.

ARTICLE 2.- Terrestrial waters are either surface or subterranean.

Surface waters are those naturally visible to man and may be either running or standing.

Running waters are those that flow through natural or artificial channels.

Standing waters are those that are accumulated in natural or artificial deposits, such as lakes, lagoons, swamps, marshes, ponds, cienagas, tanks, or reservoirs.

Subterranean waters are those that are hidden in the bosom of the earth and have not been brought to the surface.

ARTICLE 3.- Waters that flow, continuously or discontinuously, on the surface or underground, into the same basin or hydrographic watershed, are an integral part of the same current.

The basin or hydrographic watershed of a water flow is formed by all the tributaries, sub-tributaries, ravines, streams, lakes, and lagoons that flow into it, continuously or discontinuously, on the surface or underground.

ARTICLE 4.- Given their nature, waters are movable property, but when designated for the use, cultivation, or benefit of an immovable property, they are considered immovable property.

Title II

OF THE USE OF WATERS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 1
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 5.- Waters, in any of their states, are national property for public use. Consequently, their ownership and use belong to all inhabitants of the nation.

In the public interest, water use rights shall be established over the waters, which may be limited in their exercise, in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 2
D.O. 06.04.2022

For these purposes, actions taken by the authority to safeguard human consumption and sanitation, ecosystem preservation, the availability of waters, aquifer sustainability, and, in general, those aimed at promoting a balance between efficiency and security in the productive uses of water, shall be understood as being in the public interest.

Access to potable water and sanitation is an essential and inalienable human right that must be guaranteed by the State.

Water use rights may not be established in glaciers.

In the case of indigenous territories, the State shall ensure the integrity between land and water, and shall protect existing waters for the benefit of indigenous communities, in accordance with the laws and international treaties ratified by Chile that are in force.

ARTICLE 5 bis.- Waters fulfill various functions, principally those of subsistence, which include use for human consumption, sanitation, and domestic subsistence use; those of ecosystem preservation; and productive functions.

Use for human consumption, domestic subsistence use, and sanitation shall always prevail, both in the granting and in the limitation of the exercise of water use rights.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 3
D.O. 06.04.2022

Domestic subsistence uses shall be understood as the use of water that a person or a family extracts for themselves, in order to satisfy their needs for drinking, personal hygiene, drinking for their animals, and cultivation of horticultural products essential for their subsistence.

The authority shall always ensure harmony and balance between the ecosystem preservation function and the productive function that waters fulfill.

The General Directorate of Water shall be subject to the prioritization established in the second paragraph when ordering the temporary reduction of the exercise of water use rights or the redistribution of waters, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 17, 62, 314, and other pertinent norms of this Code. However, the authority must consider the geographical and climatic diversity of the country, the effective availability of water resources, and the situation of each hydrographic basin.

When water rights are granted for human consumption and sanitation, said water may only be used for other purposes to the extent that it is destined for a non-consumptive use and the preference for human consumption and sanitation prevails.

In the case of applications made by a rural sanitary service committee or cooperative, and provided they do not exceed 12 liters per second, during the processing of the definitive application, the General Directorate of Water may temporarily authorize, by resolution, the extraction of the water resource for a flow not exceeding that indicated. For this, the Directorate must conduct a site visit and prepare a technical report that supports the temporarily authorized flow and shall issue a reasoned resolution in this regard within ninety days, counted from the presentation of the application. This authorization will remain in force during the processing of the definitive application, which may not exceed one year, extendable once.

ARTICLE 5 ter.- To ensure the exercise of the functions of subsistence and ecosystem preservation, the State may establish reserves of available waters, surface or subterranean, in accordance with the provisions of Article 147 bis.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 3
D.O. 06.04.2022

Without prejudice to the foregoing, as a consequence of the termination, expiration, extinction, or renunciation of a water use right, the waters shall become available to be reserved by the State, in accordance with the provisions of this article, and for the establishment of new rights over them.

Over said reserves, the General Directorate of Water may establish water use rights for the uses of the subsistence function.

The reserved waters may be delivered to sanitary service providers to guarantee human consumption and sanitation. For the purposes of the tariff-setting process established in Decree with Force of Law No. 70 of 1988 of the Ministry of Public Works, it shall be considered that the waters delivered by virtue of this article are contributions from third parties and have a cost equal to zero.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, sanitary service providers shall maintain the obligation to guarantee the continuity and quality of service, planning and executing the necessary works for this, including those for prevention and mitigation that may be required.

ARTICLE 5 quater.- The application for and granting of water use rights over reserved waters, for the uses of the subsistence function, shall be subject, insofar as it is compatible with its object, to the procedure contained in Paragraph I of Title I of Book Two.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 3
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 5 quinquies.- Water use rights granted over reserved waters may be transferred, provided that the use for which they were originally granted is maintained and the transfers are reported to the General Directorate of Water.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 3
D.O. 06.04.2022

Water use rights established over reserved waters acquired by succession due to death or by any other derivative mode, are transmitted or transferred, as the case may be, with the same charges, encumbrances, limitations, and restrictions that affect the originally acquired right, in all their successive transfers or transmissions. This must be recorded in the respective conservatory inscriptions.

These water use rights shall be extinguished, by resolution of the Director General of Water, if their holder does not carry out the works to use the waters in accordance with the deadlines and suspensions indicated in Article 6 bis, uses them for a purpose other than that for which they were granted, or cedes their use under any other title.

The extinction referred to in the preceding paragraph may be subject to the remedies of reconsideration and complaint provided for in Articles 136 and 137. These remedies shall not suspend the execution of the resolution, without prejudice to the respective Court of Appeals ordering otherwise in the case of the remedy of complaint.

ARTICLE 6.- A water use right is a real right that pertains to waters and consists of their temporary use and enjoyment, in accordance with the rules, requirements, and limitations prescribed by this Code. The water use right originates by virtue of a concession, in accordance with the norms of this Code, or by operation of law.

The water use right that originates from a concession shall be for thirty years, which shall be granted in accordance with the criteria of availability of the supply source and/or the sustainability of the aquifer, as appropriate. In the event that the authority considers that the water use right should be granted for a shorter period, it must justify said decision by a reasoned resolution.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 4 a)
D.O. 06.04.2022

The duration of the water use right shall be extended by operation of law and successively, unless the General Directorate of Water proves, through a reasoned resolution, the non-effective use of the resource or the existence of an impact on the sustainability of the source that could not be overcome with the tools available in the fifth paragraph of this article. This extension shall be effective on the portion of the waters used in consideration of the provisions of Article 129 bis 9, first paragraph, without exceeding the period established in the preceding paragraph.

The holder may request the extension of their right in advance within the ten years prior to its expiration, which shall be evaluated by the General Directorate of Water in consideration of the criteria indicated in the first and third paragraphs of this article. Once the extension is granted, the extended period will be governed by the rules of this article and will begin to apply from the date of approval of the advance extension request. In the event that the advance extension request is rejected, the water use right will remain in force for the time remaining from its granting, with the provisions of the preceding paragraph and the other pertinent provisions of this Code applying thereto.

If there is a risk that the exercise of water use rights may cause a serious impact on the aquifer or the surface source from which it is extracted or, if this risk has materialized, the General Directorate of Water will apply the provisions of Articles 17 and 62, as appropriate. If this situation persists, it will suspend the exercise of all those rights that cause the risk or impact, which, in the case of rights that are subject to extension, must be considered in the assessment referred to in the third paragraph, in order to determine their continuity. This may even be partial.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 4 b)
D.O. 06.04.2022

For the purposes of assessing the risk or impact described in the preceding paragraph, special consideration will be given to safeguarding the functions of subsistence, human consumption, sanitation, and ecosystem preservation, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 bis.

If the holder renounces their water use right in whole or in part, they must do so by public deed, which shall be registered or noted, as appropriate, in the Water Property Registry of the competent Real Estate Registrar. The Real Estate Registrar shall inform the General Directorate of Water of the foregoing, in the terms provided by Article 122. In any case, the renunciation may not be to the detriment of third parties, especially if it diminishes the assets of the renunciant in relation to the general pledge right of creditors.
LAW 20017
Art. 1, No. 1

ARTICLE 6 bis.- Water use rights shall be extinguished in whole or in part if their holder does not make effective use of the resource under the terms provided in Article 129 bis 9. In the case of consumptive water use rights, the extinction period shall be five years, and in the case of non-consumptive rights, it shall be ten years. These extinction periods shall begin to run from the publication of the resolution that includes them for the first time in the list of water use rights subject to the payment of a fee for non-use, in accordance with the provisions of Article 129 bis 7. The provisions of Article 134 bis shall apply to this extinction procedure.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 5
D.O. 06.04.2022

The counting of the periods indicated in the first paragraph shall be suspended for the duration of the processing of the necessary permits to construct the works referred to in the first paragraph of Article 129 bis 9, which must be granted by the General Directorate of Water or the Directorate of Hydraulic Works, including the processing of the adjustments referred to in the third paragraph of Article 156. Applications for the transfer of the exercise of the water use right and for the change of its point of capture shall not be included in said suspension, except when such applications must be submitted as a consequence of compliance with a procedure required for the reception of the works by the General Directorate of Water or in other qualified cases determined by a reasoned resolution of that Directorate, where the diligence of the applicant is proven.

Likewise, the General Directorate of Water, at the request of the holder of the water use right, may suspend this period for a maximum of four years when, with respect to the construction of the necessary works for the use of the resource, the obtaining of an environmental qualification resolution is pending, a stay order has been issued in a pending lawsuit before the ordinary courts, or other proceedings requiring administrative authorizations are underway. The provision in this paragraph shall apply to the extent that the need for suspension is duly justified in said applications, and provided that the holder proves the performance of systematic, uninterrupted, and permanent actions, acts, or works aimed at using the water resource in the terms contained in the right's application.

In turn, the counting of the periods described in the first paragraph shall be suspended if the holder of the water use right justifies before the administrative authority that they have been unable to construct the works to make effective use of the resource due to circumstances of force majeure or an act of God, duly proven, and as long as they persist.

Any change of use of a water use right must be reported to the General Directorate of Water in the terms it provides. Failure to comply with this duty to report shall be sanctioned with a fine for the benefit of the treasury of the second to third degree inclusive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 173 ter.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, should it be found that the exercise of one or more water use rights, after a change of use, causes a serious impact on the aquifer or the surface source from which it is extracted, the General Directorate of Water shall apply the provisions of the fifth and sixth paragraphs of Article 6.

For the purposes of this article, a change of use shall be understood as that which occurs between different productive activities, such as agriculture, mining, industry, or electricity generation, among others.

The resolution declaring the water use right extinguished may be subject to the remedy of reconsideration regulated in Article 136, in which case its execution shall be suspended, and to the remedy of complaint provided for in Article 137, in accordance with the extinction procedure established in Article 134 bis.

ARTICLE 7.- The water use right shall be expressed in volume per unit of time.

In the case of surface waters, the water use right shall be established in the manner set forth by this Code, considering the seasonal variations of flows on a monthly basis. The respective title must always indicate the maximum authorized monthly flows.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 6
D.O. 06.04.2022

In the case of subterranean waters, the water use right shall be established in the manner set forth by this Code. The respective title must always indicate the maximum instantaneous flow and the total annual volume, in accordance with the criteria established in the Subterranean Waters Regulation.

ARTICLE 8.- Whoever holds a water use right also holds the necessary means to exercise it. Thus, whoever has the right to draw water from a source located on a neighboring property has the right of transit to access it, even if it has not been established in the title.

ARTICLE 9.- Whoever enjoys a water use right may, at their own expense, construct the works essential for its exercise.

ARTICLE 10.- The use of rainwater that falls or is collected on a private property belongs to the owner of said property, as long as it flows within their property or does not fall into natural watercourses of public use.

Consequently, the owner may store it within the property by suitable means, provided that the rights of third parties are not harmed.

ARTICLE 11.- The owner of a property may make use of, in accordance with the respective laws and ordinances, the rainwater that runs along a public road and divert its course to use it. No prescription can deprive them of this use.

ARTICLE 12.- Water use rights are consumptive or non-consumptive; of permanent or contingent exercise; continuous, discontinuous, or alternated among several persons.

ARTICLE 13.- A consumptive water use right is one that empowers its holder to consume the waters entirely in any activity.

ARTICLE 14.- A non-consumptive water use right is one that allows the use of water without consuming it and obliges its restitution in the manner determined by the act of acquisition or constitution of the right.

The extraction or restitution of the waters shall always be done in a way that does not harm the rights of third parties established over the same waters, in terms of their quantity, quality, substance, opportunity of use, and other particularities.

ARTICLE 15.- The use and enjoyment conferred by a non-consumptive water use right does not imply, except by express agreement between the parties, a restriction on the exercise of consumptive rights.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 7 a), b)
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 16.- Rights of permanent exercise are those granted with such quality from non-exhausted supply sources, in accordance with the provisions of this Code, as well as those that had this quality prior to its promulgation.

The others are of contingent exercise.

ARTICLE 17.- Water use rights of permanent exercise entitle the use of water in the corresponding allotment, unless the supply source does not contain sufficient quantity to satisfy them in their entirety, in which case the flow shall be distributed in aliquot parts.

If a vigilance committee exists, the provisions of Articles 266, 274, and following shall apply.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 8
D.O. 06.04.2022

When there is no vigilance committee exercising due jurisdiction and if the exploitation of surface waters by some users causes harm to other right holders, the General Directorate of Water, ex officio or at the request of one or more affected parties, may establish the temporary reduction of the exercise of the water use rights, on a pro-rata basis.

In those cases where two or more vigilance committees exercise jurisdiction over the same supply source, because it is sectioned, the General Directorate of Water may order a redistribution of waters between the different sections when one of these organizations feels harmed by the extractions carried out by another and so requests with justification.

This measure may be lifted when the holders of the water use rights so request or when, in the judgment of the General Directorate of Water, the causes that originated it have ceased.

ARTICLE 18.- Rights of contingent exercise only authorize the use of water in periods when the source channel has a surplus after the rights of permanent exercise have been supplied.

Lacustrine or impounded waters are not subject to rights of contingent exercise.

The exercise of contingent rights is subordinated to the preferential exercise of rights of the same nature granted previously.

ARTICLE 19.- Rights of continuous exercise are those that allow the use of water uninterruptedly twenty-four hours a day.

Rights of discontinuous exercise only allow the use of water during specific periods.

Rights of alternated exercise are those in which the use of water is distributed between two or more persons who take turns successively.

Title III

OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WATER USE RIGHT
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 9
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 20.- The water use right is originally constituted by an act of authority. Possession of the rights so constituted is acquired by the competent registration in the corresponding Real Estate Registrar. The holder of a registered water use right may dispose of it with the requirements and in the forms prescribed in this Code and other legal provisions.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 10 a), i and ii
D.O. 06.04.2022

Excepted are the water use rights over waters corresponding to springs that are born, flow, and die within the same property, as well as over the waters of smaller lakes not navigable by vessels of more than one hundred tons, of lagoons and swamps located within a single property and in which no water use rights have been constituted in favor of third parties, as of the effective date of this Code. The real right of use and enjoyment over said waters is recognized to the owner of the banks. This faculty is extinguished, by operation of law, if the property is subdivided or if the described condition of the waters is not maintained, regardless. The holders of the subdivided properties shall enjoy a preferential right over a third party's application to constitute the water use right in the proportional part corresponding to the adjudicated property. This preference shall have a duration of one year, counted from the date of the registration of the subdivision.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 10 b)
D.O. 06.04.2022

Springs or currents that permanently extinguish within that property without mixing with other waters are understood to die within the same property, unless they fall into the sea.

Exceptionally and for the sole purpose of satisfying human needs for drinking and domestic subsistence uses, any person may extract waters from springs, from mountain headwaters, or from any form of natural recharge that emerges superficially, provided this extraction does not yield any economic utility, except from those sources described in the second paragraph, to the extent that there is no concessioned or rural potable water system, or another network to supply potable water to the population in the area. In any case, if the exercise of this right were to cause a harm greater than the benefit it provides, it must be immediately suspended.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 10 c)
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 21.- The transfer, transmission, and the acquisition or loss by prescription of water use rights shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code, except as modified by this Code. The corresponding registrations shall be made in the Water Property Registry of the competent Real Estate Registrar.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 11
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 22.- The authority shall constitute the water use right over waters existing in natural sources and in state works for resource development, and may not harm or impair the rights of third parties, and considering the existing relationship between surface and subterranean waters, in accordance with what is established in Article 3.
LAW 20017
Art. 1, No. 2
D.O. 16.06.2005

ARTICLE 23.- The constitution of the water use right shall be subject to the procedure established in paragraph 2 of Title I, of Book II of this Code.

ARTICLE 24.- If the act of constitution of the water use right does not state otherwise, it shall be understood that its exercise is continuous. If the right is constituted as of discontinuous or alternated exercise, the use may only be effected in the manner and time fixed in said act.

ARTICLE 25.- The water use right entails, by operation of law, the power to impose all necessary servitudes for its exercise, without prejudice to the corresponding compensations.

ARTICLE 26.- The water use right shall include the concession of the public domain lands necessary to make it effective.
Should these lands be abandoned or destined for a different purpose, they shall revert to their former condition.

ARTICLE 27.- The Ministry of Public Works may expropriate water use rights both to satisfy the domestic needs of a population and to ensure the conservation of water resources, when no other means to obtain the water exist. For this purpose, the expropriated party must be left with the necessary water to satisfy their domestic subsistence uses. In both cases, the procedure established in Decree Law No. 2,186 of 1978, which approves the Organic Law on Expropriation Procedure, or the norm that replaces it, shall apply.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 12
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 28.- Water use rights destined for the production of electrical energy shall be subject to the provisions of this code, and the respective power plants shall continue to be governed, in other respects, by the Electrical Services Law.

ARTICLE 29.- The water use right for medicinal and mineral-medicinal waters shall be acquired in accordance with the provisions of this code, but its exercise shall be subject to the laws that govern the matter.

Title IV
OF THE BEDS OF WATERS

1.- Of Natural Beds or Channels

ARTICLE 30.- The alveo or natural channel of a public use current is the soil that the water occupies and vacates alternately in its periodic rises and falls.
For the purposes of this Code, soil is understood to be from the surface of the land to the bedrock.
This soil is of public domain and does not accrete to the contiguous properties, but the riparian owners may make use of and cultivate the surface of that soil during the times when it is not occupied by the waters.
Law 21064
Art. 1 No. 1 a)

Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, the portions of land of a property that, by avulsion, flood, or any other cause, become separated from it, shall always belong to the owner of said property and shall not form part of the riverbed.

ARTICLE 33.- Banks or margins are the lateral zones that adjoin the bed or channel.

ARTICLE 34.- In cases of alluvion, avulsion, flood, variation of a river's course, or its division into two branches, the provisions regarding accessions of soil in paragraph 2 of Title V, Book II, of the Civil Code shall apply.

2.- Of the Beds of Standing Waters

ARTICLE 35.- The alveo or bed of lakes, lagoons, swamps, and other standing waters is the soil they occupy at their ordinary high-water mark. This soil is of private domain, except in the case of lakes navigable by vessels of more than one hundred tons.
The provisions of the preceding article are applicable to these beds.

3.- Of Artificial Channels and Other Works

ARTICLE 36.- A canal or artificial channel is an aqueduct constructed by human hands. It includes the works of capture, conduction, distribution, and discharge of water, such as headgates, flumes, siphons, pipes, diversion structures, and gates. These works and canals are of private domain.
A reservoir is an artificial work where waters are collected.

Title V
OF SPILLS AND DRAINAGE OF WATER

1.- Of Spills

ARTICLE 43.- Spills are the waters that are abandoned after their use, at the exit of the property.

Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 15
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 44.- Spills that flow naturally to neighboring properties may be used within them, without the need to obtain a water use right.

ARTICLE 45.- The production of spills shall be subject to the contingencies of the source flow and to the distribution or use made of the waters on the property that originates them, for which reason it is not obligatory nor permanent.

ARTICLE 46.- The existence of a title regarding the use of spills does not imply a limitation on a better form of utilization of the waters by the holder of the water use right, unless otherwise agreed.

2.- Of Drainage

ARTICLE 47.- A drainage system consists of all natural or artificial channels that act as collectors of waters extracted for the purpose of reclaiming lands that are periodically flooded, drying out swampy or marshy lands, and lowering phreatic levels close to the surface.
Drainage systems may not be constructed in the areas of existing peatlands identified by the Ministry of the Environment in the National Wetlands Inventory, in the province of Chiloé, and in the Regions of Aysén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo and of Magallanes and the Chilean Antarctic. The General Directorate of Water shall delimit the area in which drainage systems will be considered prohibited.
Exceptionally, and to the extent that they have an environmental qualification resolution, public and private road connectivity projects may be developed in defined strips, with the least invasive layout for said areas and with works that allow a flow of water that ensures the maintenance of said ecological systems.
The norms established in Article 129 bis shall be applicable to the waters extracted from drainage systems.

ARTICLE 50.- If the excessive moisture of the soils is due to the existence of artificial works, the affected party or parties shall have the right to request their modification, which may not cause prejudice to the owner of the works or to third parties.
The costs incurred by said modifications shall be borne by those who benefit from them in proportion to the benefit they receive.
No work may be constructed that raises the natural level of the drains and the phreatic level to the detriment of third parties.
However, the maintenance of drainage works that must be constructed to prevent the damages referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be at the expense of the one who orders the works.

ARTICLE 51.- For the purposes of the provisions of the preceding articles, it shall be understood in any case that the beneficiaries who drain their properties by means of the same drainage system constitute, by that fact, a drainage community, which shall be governed by the provisions of Title III, Paragraph 2, of Book II of this Code.

ARTICLE 52.- The issues that arise from the application of the norms contemplated in this paragraph shall be resolved by the Judge of First Instance of the place where the affected property is located.

3.- General Norms

ARTICLE 53.- Waters originating from spills or drainage, falling into a natural or artificial channel, are mixed with the waters therein.

ARTICLE 54.- The use by third parties of spills or drainage does not constitute an encumbrance or servitude that affects the property that produces them. They are acts of mere tolerance that do not confer possession nor provide grounds for prescription.

ARTICLE 55.- Rights, encumbrances, or servitudes over spills and drainage may only be constituted in favor of third parties by means of a title. Not even immemorial enjoyment shall suffice to constitute them.
For the title to have effect with respect to third parties, it must be recorded in a public instrument and be registered in the Registry of Mortgages and Encumbrances of Waters of the Real Estate Registrar.

Title VI
OF SUBTERRANEAN WATERS

1.- General Norms

ARTICLE 55 bis- An aquifer is a geological formation that contains or has contained water below the earth's surface and has the capacity to store and transmit water.
Without prejudice to the ownership of the domain of this subsoil, the subterranean waters contained therein are national property for public use, which can be accessed in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
A Common Use Hydrogeological Sector shall be understood as an aquifer or part of an aquifer whose spatial and temporal hydrological characteristics allow for its delimitation for the purposes of its hydrogeological evaluation or management in an independent manner.

Art. 1, No. 18
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 56.- Anyone may dig wells on their own land for drinking and domestic subsistence uses, even if this results in the impairment of the water that feeds another well; but if it reports no utility, or not so much that it can be compared with the harm to others, they shall be obliged to seal it.
The same right, under equal conditions, may be exercised by rural sanitary services to make use of subterranean waters intended for human consumption, which they may extract from wells dug in the organization's own land, that of some of its members, or on State lands, with prior authorization in all the indicated cases. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the providers of rural sanitary services that dig wells and benefit from them must inform the General Directorate of Water of the existence and location of said works.
Those who exploit these wells may extract a volume of subterranean water equal to or less than that determined by the General Directorate of Water for each basin, provided they are intended entirely and exclusively for domestic subsistence uses.

ARTICLE 56 bis.- The waters found by mining concessionaires in exploration and exploitation labors may be used by them, to the extent that they are necessary for the exploitation works and are reported for registration to the General Directorate of Water, within ninety calendar days from their discovery. They must indicate their location and volume per unit of time and the activities that justify said need. In the case of surplus waters, they must also report them. The use and enjoyment of these waters shall be extinguished by the closure of the mining operation, by the expiration or extinction of the mining concession, because they cease to be necessary for that operation, or because they are destined for a different use.
The use and enjoyment of the waters referred to in the preceding paragraph may not endanger the sustainability of the aquifers in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 bis, or the rights of third parties, which must be verified by the General Directorate of Water, which must issue a technical report within ninety calendar days, counted from the receipt of the information indicated in the preceding paragraph. The referred report must consider the environmental evaluation to which the fourth paragraph of this article refers. Said period may be extended only once and with justification. In the event that a serious impact on the aquifers or on the rights of third parties is verified as a consequence of these uses, the General Directorate of Water shall limit their use.
The General Directorate of Water, by resolution, shall determine the forms, requirements, and frequency in which the information must be delivered, including a simplified procedure for artisanal and small-scale mining, in accordance with the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 142 of the Mining Code.
The foregoing in this article does not prevent the corresponding environmental evaluation from being applied in the exploration or exploitation, in accordance with Law No. 19,300 and its regulation, as well as with respect to its monitoring and oversight, for the purpose of evaluating the sustainability of the resource's exploitation.

2. Of the Exploration of Subterranean Waters

ARTICLE 58.- Any person may explore for the purpose of discovering subterranean waters, subject to the norms established by the General Directorate of Water.
If within the period established in the first paragraph of Article 142, two or more applications for the exploration of subterranean waters have been submitted over the same territorial extension of national property, the General Directorate of Water shall resolve the awarding of the exploration area by means of an auction among the applicants. The auction rules shall determine the manner in which said act will be carried out, with the provisions of Articles 142, 143, and 144 being applicable thereto, as appropriate.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, and provided that the permit to explore subterranean waters has been granted, for the purposes indicated in Article 142, first paragraph, it shall be understood that the date of submission of the application to constitute the water use right over subterranean waters shall be that of the resolution granting such permit.
Another's land may only be explored with the prior agreement of the owner of the property, and on national property with the authorization of the General Directorate of Water.
Explorations may not be carried out on public or private lands in areas that feed vegas, pajonales, and bofedales in the regions of Arica y Parinacota, Tarapacá, Antofagasta, Atacama, and Coquimbo, without the reasoned authorization of the General Directorate of Water, which must previously identify and delimit said areas.
Likewise, explorations may not be carried out on public or private lands in areas that correspond to aquifer sectors that feed wetlands, which have been declared by the Ministry of the Environment as threatened ecosystems, degraded ecosystems, or priority sites, to the extent that said declaration, in coordination with the General Directorate of Water, contains among its grounds that the structure and functioning of said wetland is supported by the subterranean water resources that sustain it. Subsequent to that declaration, the General Directorate of Water shall delimit the area of public or private lands in which explorations for the purposes of this article may not be carried out.

ARTICLE 63.- The General Directorate of Water may declare zones of prohibition for new exploitations, by means of a reasoned resolution for the protection of the aquifer, which shall be published in the Official Gazette.
The declaration of a zone of prohibition shall give rise to a water community formed by all the users of subterranean waters included therein, who must organize it in accordance with what is indicated in the first paragraph of Article 196, within a period of one year. As this community originates by the sole operation of law, no question may be raised about its existence in accordance with what is stated in Article 188. Once this period has elapsed without the water community having been organized, the General Directorate of Water may not authorize changes of the point of capture in said zone with respect to those persons who have not become a party to the community's organization process.
The zones corresponding to aquifers that feed vegas, pajonales, and bofedales in the regions of Arica y Parinacota, Tarapacá, Antofagasta, Atacama, and Coquimbo shall be understood as prohibited for extractions greater than those authorized, as well as for new exploitations, without the need for an express declaration.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply to those zones corresponding to aquifer sectors that feed wetlands that have been declared by the Ministry of the Environment as threatened ecosystems, degraded ecosystems, priority sites, or urban wetlands declared by virtue of Law No. 21,202, to the extent that said declaration, in coordination with the General Directorate of Water, contains among its grounds the subterranean water resources that support them. Subsequent to that declaration, the General Directorate of Water shall delimit the area in which extractions greater than those authorized, as well as new exploitations, will be considered prohibited.
In response to an application for a change of the point of capture of water use rights that are included in the zone of prohibition, the General Directorate of Water may deny it or authorize it, in whole or in part, if the hydrogeological situation of the aquifer shows significant and sustained declines that may put its sustainability at risk, implies a serious risk of saline intrusion, or affects the rights of third parties. If the Service does not have all the pertinent information, it may require the petitioner to provide the necessary studies or background information to better resolve the matter. The information supporting said change of the point of capture shall be of a public nature.
In no case may the change of the point of capture be authorized to a person who has pending litigation, as a defendant, related to the illegal extraction of water in the same zone of prohibition.
The resolutions issued by virtue of this article shall be considered notified from their publication in the Official Gazette, which shall be carried out on the first or fifteenth day of each month or the next business day, if those were holidays.

ARTICLE 64.- The authority must issue a new resolution on the maintenance or lifting of the prohibition to exploit, at the justified request of a party, if the results of new investigations regarding the characteristics of the aquifer or its artificial recharge so advise.

ARTICLE 65.- Restriction areas shall be those common use hydrogeological sectors in which there is a risk of a serious decrease in a given aquifer or of its sustainability, with the consequent prejudice to the rights of third parties already established therein.
When the background information on the exploitation of the aquifer demonstrates the convenience of declaring a restriction area in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the General Directorate of Water must so decree. This measure may also be declared at the request of any user of the respective sector, if the circumstances that warrant it are present.
The provisions of the preceding article and the limitation on the authorization of changes of the point of capture indicated in the fifth paragraph of Article 63 shall be applicable to the restriction area.
The declaration of a restriction area shall give rise to a water community formed by all the users of subterranean waters included therein.
Once the restriction area is lifted, the General Directorate of Water, for the constitution of new rights over the subterranean waters, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5, 5 bis, and 6, shall give preference to the holder of the provisionally constituted water use right, based on the order of precedence in which the applications that gave rise to said provisional rights were submitted. However, the use for human consumption, subsistence, and sanitation shall always prevail over any other preference or consideration.

ARTICLE 66.- Once a restriction area has been declared in one or more sectors of the aquifer or in its entirety, the General Directorate of Water may not grant definitive water use rights. Exceptionally, and with a prior technical report on availability at the level of the supply source, it may only grant provisional rights to the extent that they do not affect pre-existing rights and/or the sustainability of the aquifer or of one or more sectors thereof.
The technical report referred to in the preceding paragraph must consider the opinion of the existing water communities in the area.
The General Directorate of Water may always limit, in whole or in part, and even nullify these rights. It may, in turn, suspend their exercise in whole or in part, should a temporary impact on the sustainability of the aquifer or harm to already constituted water use rights be found, as long as these situations persist.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 27

ARTICLE 66 bis.- Without prejudice to other permits regulated in this Code, and with a prior favorable report from the General Directorate of Water regarding non-impact on water extractions for human consumption and aspects related to water quality, any person may execute works to artificially recharge an aquifer.
Natural recharge shall be understood as the flow or stream of water that feeds an aquifer, originating from rainwater, currents, standing, or subterranean waters, which is not a consequence of human intervention.
The work of recharging with rainwater shall not require the report referred to in the first paragraph, and for these purposes, it shall be considered natural recharge.
The artificial recharge of waters may be carried out for different purposes, such as safeguarding ecosystem preservation, including the improvement or maintenance of the aquifer's sustainability; preventing saline intrusion; taking advantage of the subsoil's purifying capacity; infiltrating desalinated water or liquid waste regulated by environmental standards; or taking advantage of the storage and conduction capacity of aquifers to later enable the reuse of these waters.
The holder of a water use right who has carried out the works referred to in the first paragraph and wishes to reuse the infiltrated waters, either at the same or another point of the aquifer, may request the General Directorate of Water to authorize them to exercise their right over the majority of the recharged waters, which, according to the technical analysis of the presented background information, considers the losses inherent to the process, the sustainability of the aquifer, and the rights of third parties.
The application to which the preceding paragraph refers shall contain the technical specifications of the work; information on the hydrogeological sector of the aquifer that justifies the amount of water intended to be extracted; the points of recharge and those from which the water is intended to be extracted; and a system for measuring and transmitting information at both points, which shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of Title I of Book Two.
The General Directorate of Water, for the purpose of issuing the respective report, must hear the interested user organizations.

Art. 1, No. 29
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 67.- When the sum of the definitive and provisional water use rights existing in a restriction area compromises the entire availability determined in the respective technical studies, said area must be declared a zone of prohibition for new exploitations, in accordance with the provisions of Article 63.
In the event that the technical background information indicates that the effect on sustainability is not due to occasional reasons, but to a permanent situation, it must also be declared a zone of prohibition.
The General Directorate of Water may review, at any time, the circumstances that gave rise to the declaration of a restriction area; however, after five years have passed since said declaration, it shall be mandatory for the Service to re-evaluate said circumstances. If it is verified that the availability is compromised, in accordance with what was previously indicated, said area shall be declared a zone of prohibition.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 63, upon declaring a zone of prohibition for new exploitations, the General Directorate of Water may not constitute new water use rights, whether definitive or provisional, and must prohibit any new exploitation of rights or of that part of them that had not been exploited prior to said declaration. Additionally, the Service must re-evaluate the sustainability situation of the Common Use Hydrogeological Sector and, consequently, may exercise the powers described in the preceding paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to what is stated in Article 62.
The holders of the granted water use rights, both in zones declared as prohibition and in restriction areas, must install and maintain a system for measuring extracted flows and volumes, for controlling phreatic levels, and a system for transmitting the information obtained. The holders, by themselves or through the Subterranean Water Communities, shall be responsible for transmitting the information collected to the General Directorate of Water. The Service, by reasoned resolution, shall determine the deadlines and conditions to comply with this obligation, and must always begin with those provisionally granted.
In case of non-compliance with these measures, the General Directorate of Water, by reasoned resolution, shall impose the sanctions established in Articles 173 and following.

OF SERVITUDES AND MORTGAGES

1.- Of Servitudes

a) General Provisions

ARTICLE 69.- The provisions of the Civil Code and special laws are applicable to the servitudes related to the waters covered by this Code, insofar as they are not modified by this law.

ARTICLE 70.- Legal servitudes may not be used for purposes other than those for which they have been constituted, except by agreement of the interested parties.

ARTICLE 71.- If there is disagreement regarding the amount of the compensation, the Judge shall resolve, with a report from experts, and must authorize the constitution only after the sum provisionally fixed to answer for the compensation that is ultimately determined has been paid.
Law 21435
Art. 1, No. 33
D.O. 06.04.2022

ARTICLE 72.- The servitudes related to waters established by the Mining Code shall be constituted and exercised in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

b) Of the Natural Drainage Servitude

ARTICLE 73.- The lower property is subject to receiving the waters that flow naturally from the higher property, that is, without human hands contributing to it.
Consequently, a drain or ditch cannot be directed onto a neighboring property, if this special servitude has not been constituted.

ARTICLE 74.- In the servient property, nothing can be done that obstructs the natural servitude, nor in the dominant property that aggravates it.
However, the owner of the lower property has the right to build within it, embankments, retaining walls, or other works that, without preventing the normal descent of the waters, serve to regulate or make use of them, as the case may be.

ARTICLE 75.- The right established in the final paragraph of the preceding article is also granted to the owner of the higher property within it, but without making the servitude that the lower property must bear more burdensome.

c) Of the Aqueduct Servitude

ARTICLE 76.- The aqueduct servitude is that which authorizes the conduction of waters through another's property at the expense of the interested party.
The servitude includes the right to construct engineering works in the channel and drains so that the waters are discharged into natural channels.

ARTICLE 77.- Every property is subject to the aqueduct servitude in favor of a town, industry, mine, or other property that needs to conduct waters for any purpose.

ARTICLE 78.- The conduction of waters shall be done through an aqueduct that does not allow leakages, spills, or overflows that harm the servient property; that does not allow water to stagnate or garbage to accumulate; and that has the necessary bridges, flumes, siphons, and other works for the convenient and effective administration and exploitation of the servient properties.
The obligation to construct the works refers to the time of the constitution of the servitude.

ARTICLE 79.- The servitude includes the right to lead the aqueduct along a route that allows the free descent of the waters and that, due to the nature of the soil, does not make the work excessively expensive.
Once these conditions are met, the channel shall be led along the route that causes the least prejudice to the servient property or estate.
The shortest route shall be considered the least prejudicial to the servient property and the least costly to the interested party, unless the contrary is proven.
The Judge shall, as far as possible, reconcile the interests of the parties and in doubtful points shall decide in favor of the servient properties.

ARTICLE 80.- Buildings, industrial and agricultural facilities, stadiums, landing strips, and their dependencies are not subject to the aqueduct servitude.

ARTICLE 81.- The layout and construction of the aqueduct on public roads shall be subject to the respective law.

ARTICLE 82.- The owner of the servient property shall have the right to be paid, by way of compensation, the price of all the land that is occupied and the improvements affected by the construction of the aqueduct; that of a space on each side, which shall not be less than fifty percent of the width of the canal, with a minimum of one meter in width along the entire length of its course, and which may be greater by agreement of the parties or by order of the Judge, when circumstances so require, to contain the debris from the construction of the aqueduct and its subsequent cleanings, and ten percent additional on the total sum. Said space, in the case of canals that run along steep slopes, shall extend in its total width on the valley side.
They shall also have the right to be compensated for any damage caused by the construction of the aqueduct and by its filtrations, spills, and overflows that may be attributable to defects in construction or poor management.
Rectification S/N
D.O. 26.11.1981

ARTICLE 83.- The owner of the aqueduct may prevent any new planting or work in the lateral space referred to in the preceding article. They may also reinforce the banks of the canal without harming the servient property.

ARTICLE 84.- Whoever has an aqueduct for their benefit on their property may oppose the construction of another on it, offering passage through their own for the waters that another person wishes to conduct, provided that no notable prejudice results to the person who wants to open the new aqueduct.
Under the same conditions, they may oppose the constitution of a new aqueduct servitude when their property is already encumbered with another that makes the construction of a new aqueduct unnecessary.
However, if due to the use of the existing canals referred to in the preceding paragraphs, widening, extensions, or modifications must be made to the channel, the procedure shall be as indicated in the following article.

ARTICLE 85.- Whoever has a water use right in a natural public-use channel may use the headgate of an existing canal that diverts from the same channel to capture their waters.
They may also use the canal to the extent necessary to conduct the waters to the point where they can be diverted independently towards the place of use.
If the canal and its complementary works have sufficient capacity to conduct the new waters, the interested party must, in any case, pay the owner of the aqueduct a compensation equivalent to the value of the land occupied by it and of the existing works in the part effectively used, on a pro-rata basis of their right.
In the event that for the exercise of a non-consumptive water use right it is unnecessary to introduce more water into the canal, because part or all of the water flowing through it is used, the compensation shall be determined by common agreement between the parties or, failing that, by the Judge.
The interested party shall, if necessary, widen the aqueduct at their own expense and shall pay, to whom it may concern, the value of the new land and the lateral space occupied by the widening.
If it concerns a headgate, all works of reform or of any other nature necessary to extract the new volume of water shall be their exclusive responsibility.
Any other prejudice shall also be the responsibility of the interested party, who must also contribute to the maintenance and operation costs of the works in the manner provided for in Article 91.

ARTICLE 86.- Whoever has an aqueduct on another's property may introduce a greater volume of water into it, provided that it does not affect the safety of the channel and must compensate for any prejudice to the owner of the servient property. If the construction of new works or the modification of existing ones is necessary for this, the provisions of Article 82 shall be observed with respect to them.

ARTICLE 87.- The aqueduct servitude shall be exercised, as a general rule, in an open-cut channel.
The aqueduct shall be protected, covered, or vaulted when it crosses populated areas and could cause damage or when the waters it conducts produce bothersome or harmful emanations.
Likewise, the protections required by the owner of the servient property, with expressed cause, must be installed. The obligation to vault the channel, install protections, or works intended to prevent damage or nuisance shall not be the responsibility of its owner when this need arises after its construction, without prejudice to their contributing to the costs of the works, to the extent that they benefit from them.

ARTICLE 129 bis 1.- With respect to the water use rights to be granted, the General Directorate of Water shall ensure the preservation of nature and the protection of the environment. For this, it shall establish a minimum ecological flow, for which it must also consider the pertinent natural conditions for each surface source.
A regulation, which must bear the signature of the Ministers of the Environment and of Public Works, shall determine the criteria by which the minimum ecological flow will be established. The minimum ecological flow may not be greater than 20 percent of the average annual flow of the respective surface source.
In qualified cases, and with a prior favorable report from the Ministry of the Environment, the President of the Republic may set different minimum ecological flows, by reasoned decree, without being bound by the limitation established in the preceding paragraph. The ecological flow set by virtue of the provisions of this paragraph may not be greater than 40 percent of the average annual flow of the respective surface source.
The General Directorate of Water may establish a minimum ecological flow with respect to existing rights in areas declared under official protection for biodiversity, such as national parks, national reserves, virgin region reserves, natural monuments, nature sanctuaries, wetlands of international importance, and priority sites of the first priority.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, the General Directorate of Water may always establish, at the new point of extraction, a minimum ecological flow in the resolution that authorizes the transfer of the exercise of the water use right for surface waters. It may, in turn, in its capacity as a sectoral body with environmental competence and within the framework of the environmental evaluation of a project, propose a minimum ecological flow or one greater than the minimum established at the time of the constitution of the water use right(s) for surface waters in those cases where they are used in the works referred to in literals a), b), and c) of Article 294. However, the environmental qualification resolution may not establish an environmental flow lower than the minimum ecological flow defined by the General Directorate of Water.

Notwithstanding what is stated in the third paragraph of Article 129 bis 2, in situ or non-extractive water use rights may be granted outside those areas that are declared under official protection for the protection of biodiversity, either because the General Directorate of Water certifies that the non-extraction of these waters benefits said official protection areas or because the Ministry of the Environment has declared the area where the water use right is granted as a protected zone. The holder may not request that this non-extractive modality of this water use right be modified, unless the Ministry of the Environment declares that the area where it was granted has ceased to be protected and the General Directorate of Water so authorizes.
Likewise, an in situ or non-extractive water use right may be requested from that Directorate for the development of a sustainable, recreational, or sporting tourism project, which must have been declared as such in the explanatory memorandum referred to in numeral 7 of Article 140, or by a subsequent act accompanying said updated memorandum.

The holder may not request that this non-extractive modality of this water use right be modified, unless, not having developed the project in question, they prove the payment of a fine for the benefit of the treasury before the General Treasury of the Republic, in an amount equivalent to the sum of the non-use fees expressed in monthly tax units, that they would have had to pay from the date the right was affected for these purposes, duly capitalized according to the maximum conventional interest rate applicable to readjustable operations in national currency. The foregoing, with a surcharge of 5 percent.
With respect to existing rights, to avail oneself of the benefit established in Article 129 bis 9 for the change from a pre-existing use modality to a non-extractive one, as mentioned in the first paragraph; its holder must obtain the authorization of the General Directorate of Water. The Regulation indicated in the preceding paragraph will also regulate the procedure for the case of the application for modification of the mode of use to which this article refers.
The rights that are constituted based on the provisions of this article, as well as those that adhere to the change of use modality, must expressly state this in the corresponding title that will be registered in the Registry of the Real Estate Registrar and in the Public Water Cadastre.

ARTICLE 129 bis 4.- Non-consumptive water use rights of permanent exercise, for which their holder has not constructed the works indicated in the first paragraph of Article 129 bis 9, shall be subject, in the proportion of their unused respective flows, to the payment of an annual fee for the benefit of the treasury.
1.- The fee shall be governed by the following rules:
a) In the first five years counted from the date on which the water use right is constituted, recognized, or authorized, the fee shall be equivalent, in monthly tax units, to the value resulting from the following arithmetic operation:
Annual fee value in UTM = 0.33xQxH.
Factor Q shall correspond to the average unused flow expressed in cubic meters per second, and factor H, to the difference in level between the points of capture and restitution expressed in meters.
b) Between the sixth and tenth years inclusive, the fee calculated in accordance with the preceding letter shall be multiplied by a factor of 2, and
c) Between the eleventh and fifteenth years inclusive, the fee calculated in accordance with letter a) above shall be multiplied by a factor of 4, and in the following five-year periods its amount shall be calculated by doubling the previous factor, and so on successively.
d) The holder of a water use right constituted prior to the publication of this law who has not constructed the works described in the first paragraph of Article 129 bis 9, ten years having elapsed since said publication date, shall be subject to the extinction of their water use right in that part not effectively utilized, in accordance with the provisions and suspensions indicated in Article 6 bis and subject to the procedure described in Article 134 bis. Without prejudice to the suspension periods established in Article 6 bis, the counting of the period to open the administrative extinction file for the right shall be suspended for the entire duration of the processing of the necessary permits to construct the works that must be granted by the General Directorate of Water and/or the Directorate of Hydraulic Works, including the adjustments referred to in the third paragraph of Article 156. Applications for the transfer of the exercise of the water use right and for the change of its point of capture shall not be included in said suspension, unless they must be submitted as a consequence of compliance with a procedure required for the reception of the works by the General Directorate of Water or in other qualified cases determined by a reasoned resolution of said Directorate, where the diligence of the applicant is proven.
2.- For the purposes of calculating the fee established in this article, if the capture of the waters has been requested through a reservoir, the value of factor H shall correspond, in any case, to the difference in level between the maximum flood height and the point of restitution expressed in meters.
In all cases where the difference in level between the points of capture and restitution is less than 10 meters, the value of factor H, for the purposes of that operation, shall be equal to 10.
For the purposes of counting the periods of non-utilization of the waters, these shall begin to run from January 1 of the year following the date of publication of Law No. 20,017, unless it concerns water use rights that are constituted, authorized, or recognized after that date.

ARTICLE 129 bis 12.- Before June 1 of each year, the General Treasurer of the Republic shall send to the competent courts the list of water use rights whose fees have not been paid, specifying their holder and the amount owed to initiate the collection procedure. The list shall have executive merit and must indicate at least: the name of the holder, date of constitution and number of the administrative act that granted the right, the part subject to tax and the respective resolution, and registration in the Water Registry of the Real Estate Registrar and in the Public Water Cadastre, if these last two are available. Within thirty days of the initiation of the judicial process, the General Treasury of the Republic shall send a copy of said lists, with proof of having been presented to the court, to the General Directorate of Water, which shall ensure compliance with this provision and shall provide its collaboration to the General Treasury of the Republic, and may act as a third-party coadjutant in these proceedings.
Until the procedure indicated in the preceding paragraph has been complied with, the payment of the overdue fee must be made with a surcharge of 10 percent of the amount owed, plus a penalty interest of 1.5 percent per month or fraction of a month, in case of default in payment of all or part of what is owed. This interest shall be calculated on the readjusted amount.
Upon receipt of the list, the judge shall issue a resolution ordering the auction, which must be notified to the debtor by the tax collector of the Treasury Service, in accordance with their legal powers, especially those provided for in Article 171 of the Tax Code. If the domicile is in an urban area, said notification shall be made by certified letter. Once the notification has been made and the period for the debtor to oppose the execution has elapsed without having done so, or, having raised opposition, it has been rejected, the judge shall issue a resolution setting a date and time for the auction and shall order that its publication, along with the list of the rights to be auctioned, be made on two different days in a newspaper or periodical of the respective province and, if there is none, in one of the capital of the corresponding region, regardless of its format, be it printed, digital, or electronic. It shall be the responsibility of the General Treasury of the Republic to make these publications and cover their costs.
The auction may not take place before thirty days following the date of the last notice.
The omissions or errors that the General Treasury of the Republic may have incurred in the list referred to in the first paragraph may be rectified before the auction, at the request of anyone with an interest therein or of the General Directorate of Water.
The judge shall proceed with knowledge of the case. The rectifications shall be published in the same manner as the original publication, and the auction shall be postponed to a later date by at least thirty days from the last publication.
The clerk of the court shall provide testimony in the records of the notice having been published in the manner and at the time indicated.
The competent judge to hear this procedure shall be that of the commune where the Real Estate Registrar, in whose Registry the water use rights are registered, has their office, or that of the commune where the capture is located, if not registered. If such rights are not registered, the General Directorate of Water may subrogate the rights of the non-registered holder, solely for the purpose of proceeding with their registration in the Water Property Registry of the competent Real Estate Registrar. Notaries, registrars, archivists, and civil officials shall be obliged to provide preferentially the copies, registrations, and annotations requested by the Director General of Water for these purposes. They shall receive the value of their actions as the executed parties pay the respective collection costs into the Treasury. If such rights are not registered, the General Directorate of Water may subrogate the rights of the non-registered holder, solely for the purpose of proceeding with their registration in the Property Registry of the competent registrar, at the expense of the individual. If there is more than one, it shall be the one on duty at the time of the receipt of the list referred to in the preceding paragraph.

ARTICLE 129 bis 12 A.- The debtor may oppose the execution within fifteen business days, counted from the date of the notification indicated in Article 129 bis 12.
The opposition shall only be admissible when based on one of the following exceptions:

Payment of the debt, provided it is evidenced in writing.

Prescription of the debt.

That some of the remedies referred to in Article 129 bis 10 are pending resolution. In this case, and while the resolution of said remedies is pending, the procedure shall be suspended.

That the payment of the fee is suspended by application of the provisions of the final paragraph of Article 129 bis 7.
The opposition shall be processed incidentally, but if the exceptions do not meet the requirements of the preceding paragraph, they shall be rejected outright. The appeal filed against the resolution that rejects the exceptions shall be granted with only a devolutive effect. The court of second instance may only order the suspension of the execution when the opposition is based on the payment of the debt evidenced in a written document or on the fact that some of the remedies referred to in Article 129 bis 10 are pending resolution. The appeal filed against the resolution that accepts the exceptions shall be granted with both effects.
If the exceptions are partially accepted, the execution shall proceed for the amount determined by the court. If the remedies to which number 3 of this article refers are accepted, the court shall order the filing of the case. Otherwise, the processing of the auction procedure shall continue.

ARTICLE 129 bis 13.- The minimum bid for the auction shall be the value of the owed fees, or the corresponding part. The holder of the right may release it by paying said value, with a surcharge of 100 percent thereof.
To take part in the auction, every bidder must provide a sufficient guarantee for the benefit of the treasury, qualified by the court without further appeal, to ensure the payment of the auctioned water use rights. The guarantee shall be equivalent to 10 percent of the owed sum, or the corresponding part, and shall subsist until the definitive deed of award is executed.
If the successful bidder does not pay the auction price within fifteen days from the date of the auction, the award shall be nullified by operation of law, and the judge shall enforce the guarantee for the benefit of the treasury. In the same act, the judge shall order the total or partial cancellation of the corresponding registrations in the Water Property Registry of the competent Real Estate Registrar and shall send a copy of said resolution to the General Directorate of Water. The debt shall be considered extinguished once the cancellation ordered by the judge is registered. By operation of law, the waters shall become available to be reserved in accordance with Article 5 ter or available for the constitution of new water use rights in accordance with the general norms, prioritizing the uses of subsistence and ecosystem preservation.
If the sum obtained from the auction exceeds the amount owed for fees, expenses, and costs, the remainder shall be delivered to the executed party, once the surcharge, expenses, and costs associated with the auction have been deducted.
The sale by auction shall be conducted by the corresponding court, and the Treasury, represented for these purposes by the lawyer of the Treasury Service, public sector institutions, and any person, natural or legal, may participate in it on equal terms. The Treasury may impute the amount owed for fees to the auction price.
In those cases where no bidders appear on the day designated for the auction, the judge shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the third paragraph. In those cases where the Treasury is awarded the water use right and its representative states that it does so in favor of a public service for the development of a specific project or for the purposes contemplated in Article 5 bis, the water use right may be assigned to said service, with the exception of the General Directorate of Water. Otherwise, the procedure shall be in accordance with the provisions of the third paragraph.
The provisions of Articles 2428 of the Civil Code and 492 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be applicable to the auction procedure of the water use right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Treasury shall have preference over any other creditor to collect the owed fee from the proceeds of the auction.

a) 65% of said net proceeds and auction proceeds shall be incorporated into the share of the National Fund for Regional Development that is annually allocated, in the National Budget, to the Region where the Real Estate Registrar, in whose Registry the water use rights are registered, has their office.
b) The remaining 10% shall be distributed proportionally to the surface area of the basins of the respective communes where the competent Real Estate Registrar, in whose Registry the water use rights are registered, is located.
The proportion of the amount indicated in letter a) above, corresponding to each Region, shall be determined as the quotient between the amount collected for fees and auctions corresponding to the Region where the Real Estate Registrar, in whose Registry the water use rights are registered, has their office, and the total amount collected for these concepts in all the Regions of the country. The same criterion shall apply in the case of the municipalities referred to in letter b). In the latter case, if a water use right is located in the territory of two or more communes, the General Directorate of Water shall determine the proportion corresponding to each of them, dividing the corresponding amount on a pro-rata basis of the surface area of each commune included in the territorial extension of the water use right.
The Budget Law shall include, in the budgets of the corresponding Regional and municipal Governments, the amounts resulting from the application of the preceding paragraphs.
For the purposes of this article, net proceeds shall be understood as the amounts resulting from subtracting from the gross collection, obtained from the application of the fees established in Articles 129 bis 4, 129 bis 5, and 129 bis 6, the sums imputed to the payment of fiscal taxes in the manner provided for in the following article, both values corresponding to the twelve-month period, counted backwards from the month of June of the year prior to the effective date of the Budget Law that includes the distribution that proceeds according to this provision.

The holders of water use rights may deduct from the amount of their mandatory provisional payments of the Law on Income Tax the monthly amounts they pay for fees in the years prior to that in which the use of the waters begins. The remainder resulting from this imputation, due to the mandatory provisional payment being lower or due to the non-existence of the obligation to do so in said period, may be imputed to any other fiscal tax of withholding or surcharge of monthly declaration and simultaneous payment to be paid on the same date, and the balance that still remains may be imputed to the same taxes indefinitely in the following months, until its total depletion, adjusted in the manner prescribed by Article 27 of Decree Law No. 825 of 1974.

ARTICLE 132.- Third parties who feel affected in their rights may oppose the submission within thirty days counted from the date of the last publication or notification, as the case may be.
Within the fifth day of receiving the opposition, the authority shall forward it to the applicant, for them to respond within fifteen days.
NOTE
Numeral 63 of Article 1 of Law 21435, published on 06.04.2022, provides for modifying the first paragraph of this article by inserting between the expressions "Third parties" and "who feel," the following phrase: "holders of constituted water use rights registered in the Water Property Registry of the respective Real Estate Registrar." The said modification, as established by its tenth transitory article, will begin to apply two years after the publication of the said law. However, through numeral 2 of Article 1 of Law 21586, published on 13.07.2023, the said tenth transitory article is modified, substituting the expression "two years after the publication of this law" for "from April 6, 2025," which is why the said modification is available in the deferred version corresponding to April 6, 2025.

ARTICLE 133.- Once these procedures are completed, the submission and other antecedents shall be sent to the General Directorate of Water, if they were presented to the Governorate, within three business days counted from the receipt of the response to the opposition.
If within the periods provided for in the preceding article, no opposition has been filed or, there being an opposition, it has not been answered, the three-day period shall be counted, respectively, from the expiration of the thirty and fifteen-day periods referred to in the mentioned article.

ARTICLE 134.- The General Directorate of Water, ex officio or at the request of a party and within thirty days from the receipt of the antecedents sent by the Governors or from the response to the opposition or from the expiration of the period to oppose or to answer the opposition, as the case may be, may, by reasoned resolution, request clarifications, order on-site inspections, and request the corresponding reports for a better resolution.
Once the requested antecedents are gathered, the General Directorate of Water must issue a technical report and dictate a reasoned resolution that settles the matter submitted for its consideration, within a maximum period of four months, from the expiration of the 30-day period referred to in the preceding paragraph.

ARTICLE 134 bis.- With respect to the consumptive water use rights that have been included in the fee list for non-use for five years or more and the non-consumptive ones for ten years or more and that, therefore, are in a condition to be submitted to an extinction procedure, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 6 bis, 129 bis 4, 129 bis 5, and 129 bis 9, first paragraph, the General Directorate of Water shall apply the following procedure:

It shall annually issue a resolution containing the list of water use rights whose holders have not made effective use of the resource under the terms provided for in the heading of this article. Said list must contain a clear and precise statement of the water use right on which the procedure falls, in the terms provided for in the first paragraph of Article 129 bis 7, and shall specify the proportion of the flow affected by the extinction process and the fee payment lists in which it has been included. This resolution will be published on the institutional website.

The indicated resolution shall be notified to the holder of the water use right, before January 10 of each year, by certified letter addressed to their domicile, if this information is available, or to the email address that the holder has specially registered for the purpose of notifications or communications with the Service. The notification by certified letter shall be deemed to have been made from the third day following its receipt at the corresponding post office, and that made by email shall be deemed to have been made on the third day after its sending. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of computing the period for the extinction procedure, the provisions of numeral 4 and following shall apply. If this notification could not be made by any of the indicated means, either because the holder's domicile is unknown or because they have not registered an email address, the publication in the Official Gazette referred to in the following numeral shall be understood as sufficient notification.

The General Directorate of Water shall publish in the Official Gazette, on January 15 of the same year referred to in the preceding numeral or the next business day, the list of water use rights contained in the resolution referred to in numeral 1.

The holder of the water use right that is the subject of the extinction procedure shall have a period of thirty days, counted from the publication contemplated in the preceding numeral, to oppose said procedure, and shall provide all the evidence they deem necessary and pertinent to prove the effective use of the resource or to be within other exempting circumstances provided for by this Code. Furthermore, the holder may request pertinent inquiries, understood as such those intended to prove the existence of the use works, inquiries to which the General Directorate of Water must agree in consideration of their pertinence. The indicated period shall be extended for thirty days, at the request of the affected right holder.

Within thirty days following the expiration of the period indicated in the previous number or its extension, the General Directorate of Water may request clarifications, order on-site inspections, request reports, or carry out any other inquiry for a better resolution.

The General Directorate of Water, to carry out the requested or decreed evidentiary inquiries, shall have a period of thirty days, counted from the expiration of the term indicated in the previous number or its extension, and may extend it justifiably and for a single time for an additional thirty days.

Once the inquiries referred to in numbers 4, 5, and 6 are completed, the official in charge of the procedure shall have a period of thirty days to issue a technical report, in which they will analyze the matters submitted for their knowledge regarding the appropriateness or not of the extinction of the water use right for non-effective use of the resource, in the terms indicated in this article, and will propose a pronouncement to the Director General of Water.

The Director General of Water, by reasoned resolution, shall resolve the extinction file of a water use right, ruling solely and exclusively on whether the extinction is appropriate or not. To adopt this resolution, they will have a period of fifteen days counted from when the technical report referred to in the previous number was issued. This resolution shall be notified according to the provisions of the first and second paragraphs of Article 139, or failing that, to the email address that the holder has registered in their first submission in this procedure or at any other time within it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the sole purpose of third-party publicity, the resolution will be published on the institutional webpage. Against this resolution, the remedies of reconsideration and complaint established respectively in Articles 136 and 137 shall proceed, and the effects of the challenged act shall be suspended by their filing.

In what is not regulated in this paragraph, the provisions of the general procedure of Title I of Book Two of this Code shall apply.
The complaint remedy regarding the resolution that extinguishes a water use right, in accordance with Article 137 of this Code, shall be subject to the provisions of Title XVIII of Book I of the Code of Civil Procedure, with the following particularities:
a) The claimant shall state in their brief, with precision, the act, omission, or circumstance on which the claim is based, the legal norm presumed to be infringed, the reasons why it does not conform to the law, the regulations, or other applicable provisions, and may offer evidence, specifying what is intended to be proven and how it is intended to be proven, the effective use of the resource, or being within other exempting circumstances.
b) The Court shall reject the claim outright if it is filed out of time. If it is declared admissible, it shall give a ten-day notice and shall notify this resolution to the Director General of Water by the means it deems quickest and most efficient. Once the notice has been served or deemed served in default, the Court may open an evidentiary period, if it deems it necessary, which shall be governed by the rules of incidents contemplated in Article 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the means of proof referred to in Article 341 of that Code shall be admissible.
Once the extinction resolution referred to in numeral 8 is final and enforceable, the General Directorate of Water must communicate it, within the following fifteen days, to the respective real estate registrars, by the means it deems quickest and most efficient, for them to carry out the cancellations and registrations that may proceed.

ARTICLE 142.- If within six months from the submission of the application, two or more applications have been submitted for the same waters and there are not sufficient resources to satisfy all the requirements, the General Directorate of Water, once the antecedents that prove the existence of available waters for the constitution of new rights over them have been gathered, shall call for an auction of these rights. The auction rules shall determine the manner in which said act will be carried out.
The call shall be made by means of a notice, published in extract in a newspaper or periodical of the province or capital of the region where the section of the current or the natural source in which the concession of rights was requested is located. Likewise, the call shall be published on the institutional website and in the Official Gazette.
Said notice shall indicate the date, time, and place of the auction, with at least ten days between the last publication and the auction. The General Directorate of Water shall communicate by certified letter the aforementioned antecedents to the applicants who, within the period established in the first paragraph of this article, have submitted applications for the same waters involved in the auction. The same notification may be made to the respective user organization. In these notices and communications, the General Directorate of Water must indicate the area that is compromised, from the point of view of availability for the constitution of new water use rights once the rights involved in the auction are awarded. The omission of the sending of the certified letter referred to in this paragraph shall not invalidate the respective auction, without prejudice to making effective the responsibility of the official who incurred in such omission.
The auction must take place when all the oppositions referred to in the 2nd paragraph of the preceding article have been resolved. The Director General of Water may order the accumulation of the proceedings.
The auction procedure described in the preceding paragraphs shall not apply to cases in which the submitted applications refer to the uses of the subsistence function. The preference for the constitution of the water use rights originating from said applications shall be applied considering the relationship between the requested flow and the equivalent use, with respect to the same person, in accordance with the regulations in force.

The Director General of Water, if the cases indicated in the first paragraph of Article 142 do not apply, may, by reasoned resolution, limit the flow of an application for water use rights, if there is a manifest lack of equivalence between the amount of water needed to be extracted, considering the purposes invoked by the petitioner in the explanatory memorandum indicated in No. 7 of Article 140 of this Code, and the flows indicated in a table of equivalences between water flows and uses, which reflects the usual practices in the country regarding water use. Said table shall be set by supreme decree signed by the Ministers of Public Works, Mining, Agriculture, and Economy.
Likewise, when it is necessary to reserve the resource to satisfy the uses of the subsistence function or for ecosystem preservation purposes, in accordance with Article 5 ter, the President of the Republic may reserve the water resource, by reasoned decree, with a prior report from the General Directorate of Water.
Similarly, due to exceptional circumstances and national interest, he may order the partial or total denial of applications for water use rights, whether for consumptive or non-consumptive uses. This decree shall be published once in the Official Gazette, on the first or fifteenth day of each month, or the next business day if those were holidays, and on the institutional website of the Directorate. This faculty shall be exercised by the Minister of Public Works, who shall sign the respective decree "By order of the President of the Republic."
If there is no availability to grant the water use rights in the requested form, the Director General of Water may do so in a different amount or with different characteristics, and may even deny in whole or in part the respective applications, as appropriate.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 22, 65, 66, 67, 129 bis 1, and 141 final paragraph, the constitution of water use rights over subterranean waters shall proceed, provided that the exploitation of the respective aquifer is appropriate for its sustainability, conservation, and protection in the long term, considering the technical antecedents of recharge and discharge, as well as the existing use conditions, all of which must be of public knowledge.

In the latter case, preference may be given to non-profit organizations, ensuring the public interest.
The decree must contain the provisions of Article 149, and the limitations established in Article 5 quinquies shall apply, and in the case of being granted to sanitary service providers, the fourth and fifth paragraphs of Article 5 ter.

ARTICLE 307 ter.- It is the duty of the General Directorate of Water to evaluate the hydraulic works projects that are submitted for its consideration, and to issue its technical report based on the antecedents provided by the applicant and other information required for a better resolution.
The holders of works projects who submit the applications referred to in Articles 151, 171, and 294 and following, may request that the General Directorate of Water randomly appoint an expert from the Registry of External Experts in charge of said Directorate, to prepare a pre-review report of the corresponding project.
The General Directorate of Water, by resolution, shall determine the minimum contents that the reports of the external experts must contain, in which it will differentiate the cases of projects related to headgates, the modification projects indicated in Article 171, and the major works projects, and shall determine for each category the costs of the expert assessment. Likewise, in said resolution, the requirements, disqualifications, and incompatibilities to which said external experts must adhere to be registered and remain in the registry shall be set. Conflict of interest must be avoided.
The following may not be registered in the said registry:

ARTICLE 309.- The water use rights granted prior to this Code, and which are not expressed in volume per unit of time, shall be understood to be equivalent to the maximum flow legitimately used in the five years prior to the date on which a controversy over its amount arises.

ARTICLE 310.- The water use rights recognized by a final and enforceable judgment on the date of promulgation of this Code shall subsist, and those that emanate from:

Grants conceded by a competent authority, without prejudice to the provisions of transitory articles 2 and 5.

Articles 834, 835, and 836 of the Civil Code, in relation to riparian owners, and of Article 944 of the same Code, acquired during the validity of these provisions, provided they are in current use and exercise, and

Prescription.

ARTICLE 311.- The exercise of water use rights recognized or constituted under the validity of previous laws shall be governed by the norms of this code, except as provided in the final paragraph of Article 18.

ARTICLE 312.- For the purposes indicated in Article 16, the following are deemed to be rights of permanent exercise, as of the date of promulgation of this code:

Those that emanate from a grant conceded with such quality prior to its promulgation, provided their holders have exercised them with the same powers that Article 17 grants to the holders of permanent exercise rights, conceded in accordance with this code;

Those recognized with this quality by a final and enforceable judgment;

Those that emanate from Articles 834, 835, and 836 of the Civil Code, in relation to riparian owners; from Article 944 of the same Code, acquired during the validity of these provisions, and from prescription, exercised in waters not subject to turns or rationing;

The same rights of the preceding number, provided they have been recognized as of permanent exercise in waters subject to turns or rationing, and

Those that emanate from grants conceded by a competent authority without the obligation to return the waters;

Those recognized with this quality by a final and enforceable judgment, and

The rights exercised with the quality of consumptive, for five years, without contradiction from third parties.

ARTICLE 314.- The President of the Republic, at the request and with a report from the General Directorate of Water, may declare zones of water scarcity in a situation of severe drought for a maximum period of one year, extendable successively, with a prior report from the said Directorate, for each extension period.
The General Directorate of Water shall previously qualify, by resolution, the criteria that determine the character of severe drought.
Once the zone of water scarcity has been declared, with the object of reducing to a minimum the general damages derived from the drought, especially to guarantee human consumption, sanitation, or domestic subsistence use, in accordance with the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 5 bis, the General Directorate of Water may require, for these purposes, the respective vigilance committee(s) and the administrators of state works for resource development, when their administration does not correspond to the State, to present a redistribution agreement, within fifteen calendar days from the declaration of scarcity. This agreement must contain the minimum technical conditions and the obligations and limitations that ensure that in the redistribution of the waters, among all the users of the basin and the beneficiaries of the work, as appropriate, the uses for human consumption, sanitation, or domestic subsistence use prevail, preventing the commission of serious faults or abuses.
If the agreement is approved by the General Directorate of Water, the vigilance committees and the administrators of state works for resource development, when their administration does not correspond to the State, must comply with it within five calendar days from its approval, and its execution shall be enforceable against all users of the respective basin. In the event that a prior agreement exists that meets all these requirements and has been approved by the Service before the declaration of scarcity, it shall be proceeded with, and must be put into effect within five calendar days from the declaration.
However, both the administrators of state works for resource development, when their administration does not correspond to the State, and those canal associations or water communities that, within their distribution networks, supply sanitary service providers, must adopt the necessary measures so that, with the allotment that corresponds to them by the application of the redistribution agreement, said providers receive the flow or volumes required to guarantee human consumption, sanitation, or domestic subsistence use.
If the redistribution agreement referred to in the third paragraph is not presented within the period contemplated therein, or if they do not comply with what was previously indicated, the Service may order the fulfillment of these measures or may order the suspension of their powers, as well as the sectioning of the natural currents that are included within the zone of scarcity, to carry out directly the redistribution of the surface and/or subterranean waters available in the source, charging the respective vigilance committees and, where appropriate, the respective administrators to redistribute the waters accumulated in state works for resource development. The General Directorate of Water may liquidate and collect the associated costs monthly. The foregoing is without prejudice to the vigilance committees' ability to present for consideration to the General Directorate of Water the agreement to which the third and fourth paragraphs refer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Directorate of Water may authorize extractions of surface or subterranean waters destined with preference to the uses of human consumption, sanitation, or domestic subsistence use and the execution of the necessary works in the channels for this purpose from any point without the need to constitute water use rights, without being subject to the norms established in Title I of Book Two and without the limitation of the minimum ecological flow established in Article 129 bis 1. The authorizations granted by virtue of this paragraph shall be in force as long as the decree of scarcity is in force.
Any holder of rights who receives a smaller proportion of water than that which would correspond to them according to the existing availabilities shall have the right to be compensated by whom it may concern.
Only those holders of water use rights who receive a smaller proportion of water than that which would correspond to them if the General Directorate of Water were to apply the powers conferred upon it in the sixth paragraph shall have the right to be compensated by the Treasury. In no case shall compensation be due if said smaller proportion is a consequence of the prioritization of human consumption, sanitation, and domestic subsistence use, in the terms indicated in this article.
This declaration of a zone of scarcity shall not be applicable to the waters accumulated in private reservoirs.
The supreme decrees and the resolutions of the General Directorate of Water that are issued by virtue of the powers conferred in the preceding paragraphs shall be complied with immediately, without prejudice to their subsequent review by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic.

The application shall be presented to the General Directorate of Water; once declared admissible, the antecedents shall be sent to the Agricultural and Livestock Service.
The existence and extent of the expropriated water use rights, the relationship between such rights and the irrigated area, and the circumstance that there are no other water use rights assigned to the same property must be proven. For this, the General Directorate of Water may require the Agricultural and Livestock Service to report on said circumstances in reference to each assigned property, to the reserve, to the part that has been excluded from the expropriation, and to that which has been segregated for any reason when appropriate.
