(a) the environmental and socioeconomic needs served by the above human activities cannot be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option which does not entail disproportionate costs;
(b) appropriate care is taken to ensure that -
(i) for surface water, the highest ecological potential and the best possible chemical status are achieved, given impacts that could not reasonably have been avoided due to the nature of the human activity or pollution;
(ii) for groundwater, the least possible changes to good status occur, given impacts that could not reasonably have been avoided due to the nature of the human activity or pollution;
(c) no further deterioration in the status of the affected body of water occurs; and
(d) the establishment of less stringent environmental objectives, and the corresponding justification, are specifically set out in the river basin management plan referred to in Article 22, and those objectives are reviewed every six years.

shall not constitute a breach of the requirements of this Law, provided that the conditions and terms of the following subsections of this Article are met.
(2) In any of the circumstances referred to in subsection (1), the competent authority shall ensure that all practicable steps are taken to prevent further deterioration in the status of the affected water body and not to compromise the achievement of the objectives of this Law in other bodies of water not affected.
(3) The measures referred to in subsection (2) shall be included in the programme of measures provided for in Article 19 and shall be of such a nature and extent as not to compromise the restoration of the quality of the water body after the end of the circumstances or accidents on account of which they were taken.
(4) The conditions under which the unforeseen or exceptional circumstances of subsection (1) may be declared by the competent authority shall be defined in the river basin management plan, which shall include for this purpose the appropriate indicators.
(5) The competent authority shall ensure that an annual review is carried out of the effects of any circumstances referred to in subsection (1) and, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 13, all practicable steps are taken for the reasonably earliest possible restoration of the water body to the status it had before the said effects.
(6) Any consequences for any water body due to the circumstances referred to in subsection (1), as well as the measures taken or to be taken for their prevention or restoration, shall be recorded in a summary which shall be included in the next update of the river basin management plan.
13(1)/2004

Permissible derogations
16. This Law shall not be deemed to be breached in any case where -
(a) failure to achieve good groundwater status, good ecological status or, where relevant, good ecological potential or to prevent deterioration in the status of any body of surface or ground water is the result of new modifications to the physical characteristics of a surface water body or alterations to the level of bodies of groundwater; or
(b) failure to prevent deterioration from high status to good status of any body of surface water is the result of new sustainable human development activities, and provided that the following conditions are met, namely -
(i) all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impacts on the status of the body of water;
(ii) the reasons for those modifications or alterations are specifically set out in the river basin management plan prepared in accordance with Article 22 and the objectives are reviewed every six years;
(iii) the reasons for those modifications or alterations are of overriding public interest, and/or the benefits to the environment and to society of achieving the objectives set out in Articles 9, 10, 11 and 12 are outweighed by the benefits of the new modifications or alterations to human health, to the maintenance of human safety or to sustainable development; and
(iv) the beneficial objectives served by those modifications or alterations of the water body cannot be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option, either for technical reasons or due to excessive cost.
13(1)/2004

Ensuring the objectives of the Law
17.(1) When applying Articles 7, 13, 14, 15 and 16, the competent authority shall ensure that the application does not permanently exclude or compromise the achievement of the objectives of this Law in other bodies of water and is consistent with the implementation of other environmental legislation and the Community environmental acquis.
(2) The competent authority shall take the appropriate measures to ensure that the application of Articles 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 guarantees at least the same level of protection for water systems as provided for by the existing environmental legislation and the relevant environmental acquis.
13(1)/2004

Measures in case of non-achievement of objectives
18.(1) If, on the basis of the data collected during the monitoring carried out on the basis of Article 24 or on the basis of other data, it is established that the objectives set out in Articles 9 to 17 are unlikely to be achieved with regard to any water body, then the competent authority shall ensure that -
(a) the causes of the likely failure are investigated;
(b) the permits and any authorisations granted on the basis of the Control of Water Pollution Law or any other law, regulation or order are examined and, where deemed appropriate, reviewed;
(c) the monitoring programmes established on the basis of Article 24 are reviewed and adjusted, where deemed appropriate; and
(d) any additional measures necessary to achieve the said objectives are established, including, where deemed appropriate, the establishment of more stringent environmental standards in accordance with the procedures provided for in Annex V.
(2) If the causes of the likely failure referred to in subsection (1) are due to circumstances of natural cause or force majeure and are exceptional or could not reasonably have been foreseen, including cases of extreme floods or prolonged drought, the competent authority may, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 15, decide that the implementation of the additional measures referred to in subsection (1) is not feasible.

1. SURFACE WATERS
1.1. Characterisation of surface water body types

The competent authority shall identify the location and boundaries of bodies of surface water and shall carry out an initial characterisation of all such bodies in accordance with the following methodology. For this initial characterisation, the competent authority may group several bodies of surface water.
i) Bodies of surface water within the river basin district shall be categorised as either rivers, lakes, transitional waters or coastal waters, or as artificial surface water bodies or heavily modified water bodies.
ii) For each surface water category, the relevant surface water bodies within the river basin district shall be differentiated into types. These types are those defined using either "System A" or "System B", which are described in section 1.2.
iii) If System A is used, surface water bodies within the river basin district shall first be differentiated into the relevant ecoregions according to the geographical areas described in section 1.2 and shown on the relevant map in Annex XI. Subsequently, the water bodies within each ecoregion shall be differentiated into surface water body types based on the descriptors in the tables for System A.
iv) If System B is used, the competent authority must achieve at least the same degree of differentiation as would be achieved with System A. Accordingly, the surface water bodies within the river basin district shall be differentiated into types using the values of the obligatory descriptors and of such optional descriptors or combinations of descriptors as are required to ensure that the biological reference conditions are reliably derived.
v) For artificial and heavily modified surface water bodies, the differentiation shall be carried out in accordance with the descriptors for whichever of the surface water categories most closely resembles the heavily modified or artificial water body concerned.
vi) The competent authority shall submit a map or maps (in a GIS format) of the geographical location of the types corresponding to the degree of differentiation required under System A.

1.3. Establishment of type-specific reference conditions for the different types of surface water bodies
i) For each type of surface water body characterised in accordance with section 1.1, type-specific hydromorphological and physicochemical conditions shall be established representing the values of the hydromorphological and physicochemical quality elements specified in section 1.1 of Annex V for that surface water body type at high ecological status as defined in the relevant table in section 1.2 of Annex V. Type-specific biological reference conditions shall be established representing the values of the biological quality elements specified in section 1.1 of Annex V for that surface water body at high ecological status as defined in the relevant table of section 1.2 of Annex V.
ii) In applying the procedures of this section to heavily modified or artificial surface water bodies, references to high ecological status shall be construed as references to maximum ecological potential as defined in table 1.2.5 of Annex V. The values for maximum ecological potential for a water body shall be reviewed every six years.
iii) The type-specific conditions for the purposes of points i) and ii) and the type-specific biological conditions may be either spatially based or based on modelling, or may be derived using a combination of these methods. Where it is not possible to use these methods, the competent authority may use expert judgement to establish these conditions. In defining high ecological status with respect to the concentrations of specific synthetic pollutants, the detection limits are those that can be achieved with the techniques available at the time of establishing the type-specific conditions.
iv) For spatially based type-specific biological reference conditions, the competent authority shall establish a reference network for each surface water body type. The network shall contain a sufficient number of sites of high status to provide a sufficient level of confidence in the values for the reference conditions, given the variability in the values of the quality elements corresponding to high ecological status for that surface water body type and the modelling techniques that will be applied in accordance with point v).
v) Type-specific biological reference conditions based on modelling may be derived using either predictive models or hindcasting methods. The methods shall use historical, palaeological and other available data and shall provide a sufficient level of confidence in the values of the reference conditions to ensure that the conditions so derived are consistent and valid for each surface water body type.
vi) Where it is not possible to establish reliable reference conditions for a quality element in a surface water body type due to high natural variability and not just due to seasonal variations of that element, that element may be excluded from the assessment of ecological status for that surface water body type. In such circumstances, the competent authority shall state the reasons for this exclusion in the river basin management plan.

1.4. Identification of pressures
The competent authority shall collect and maintain information on the type and magnitude of the significant anthropogenic pressures to which the surface water bodies in each river basin district are liable to be subject, in particular:
calculates and identifies significant point source pollution, in particular by substances listed in Annex VIII, from urban, industrial, agricultural and other installations and activities, based, inter alia, on information collected under the legislation enacted for the purposes of harmonisation with Articles -
i) 15 and 17 of Directive 91/271/EEC,
ii) 9 and 15 of Directive 96/61/EC(1)
and, for the purposes of the initial river basin management plan:
iii) with Article 11 of Directive 76/464/EEC and
iv) the Council Directives 75/440/EEC, 76/160/EEC, 78/659/EEC and 79/923/EEC,
calculates and identifies significant diffuse source pollution, in particular by substances listed in Annex VIII, from urban, industrial, agricultural and other installations and activities, based, inter alia, on information collected under the legislation enacted for the purposes of harmonisation with -
i) Articles 3, 5 and 6 of Directive 91/676/EEC,
ii) Articles 7 and 17 of Directive 91/414/EEC,
iii) Directive 98/8/EC,
and, for the purposes of the first river basin management plan:
iv) with Directives 75/440/EEC, 76/160/EEC, 76/464/EEC, 78/659/EEC and 79/923/EEC.
calculates and identifies significant water abstraction for urban, industrial, agricultural and other uses, including seasonal variations and total annual demand, and the loss of water in distribution systems;
calculates and identifies the impact of significant water flow regulation, including water transfer and diversion, on the general flow characteristics and water balances;
calculates and identifies other significant anthropogenic impacts on the status of surface waters; and
calculates the land use patterns, including the identification of the main urban, industrial and agricultural areas and, where appropriate, fisheries and forests.

1.5. Assessment of impact
The competent authority shall assess the susceptibility of the status of surface water bodies to the aforementioned pressures.

2. GROUNDWATER
2.1. Initial characterisation
The competent authority shall carry out an initial characterisation of all groundwater bodies in order to assess their uses and the risks that they will not meet the objectives for each groundwater body in accordance with Articles 9-17. For this initial characterisation, the competent authority may group several groundwater bodies. During this analysis, existing hydrological, geological, pedological, land use, discharge, abstraction and other data may be used to identify:

the location and boundaries of the groundwater body or bodies,
the pressures to which the groundwater body or bodies are liable to be subject, including inter alia:

diffuse sources of pollution,

point sources of pollution,

abstraction,

artificial recharge,

the general character of the overlying strata in the catchment from which the groundwater body receives its recharge,

groundwater bodies for which there are directly dependent surface water ecosystems or terrestrial ecosystems.

2.2. Further characterisation
Following this initial characterisation, the competent authority shall carry out a further characterisation of those groundwater bodies or groups of bodies which have been identified as being at risk in order to establish a more precise assessment of the significance of the risk and to identify any measures to be required under Articles 18-21. This characterisation shall therefore include relevant information on the impact of human activities and, where relevant, information on:

the geological characteristics of the groundwater body, including the extent and type of geological units,

the hydrogeological characteristics of the groundwater body, including hydraulic conductivity, porosity and confinement,

the characteristics of the superficial deposits and soils in the catchment from which the groundwater body receives its recharge, including their thickness, porosity, hydraulic conductivity and absorptive properties of the deposits and soils,

the stratification characteristics of the water within the groundwater body,

an inventory of associated surface systems, including terrestrial ecosystems and bodies of surface water, with which the groundwater body is dynamically linked,

estimates of the directions and rates of exchange of water between the groundwater body and associated surface systems, and

sufficient data to calculate the long-term annual average rate of overall recharge,

the characterisation of the chemical composition of the groundwater, including the specification of the contributions from human activity. When establishing natural background levels for these bodies of groundwater, the competent authority may use typologies for groundwater characterisation.

2.3. Review of the impact of human activity on groundwater
For those groundwater bodies that are identified in the initial characterisation carried out in accordance with section 2.1 as being at risk of failing to meet the objectives set for each body under Articles 9-17, the following information shall, where relevant, be collected and maintained for each groundwater body:
a) the location of abstraction points in the groundwater body, except for:

abstraction points providing less than 10 m3 per day on average, or

points for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption providing less than 10 m3 per day on average or serving fewer than 50 persons;
b) the mean annual rates of abstraction from such points;
c) the chemical composition of water abstracted from the groundwater body;
d) the location of points in the groundwater body where water is directly discharged;
e) the rates of discharge at such points;
f) the chemical composition of the water discharged into the groundwater body; and
g) land use in the catchment or catchments from which the groundwater body receives its recharge, including pollutant inputs and man-made alterations to the recharge characteristics such as rainwater run-off diversion and percolation due to land sealing, artificial recharge, damming or drainage.

2.4. Review of the impact of changes in groundwater level
The competent authority shall also identify those groundwater bodies for which lower objectives are specified under Articles 9-17, inter alia as a result of the impact of the status of the body on:
i) surface water and associated terrestrial ecosystems;
ii) water regulation, flood protection and land drainage;
iii) human development.

2.5. Review of the impact of pollution on groundwater quality
The competent authority shall also identify those groundwater bodies for which less stringent objectives are specified under Article 14 where, as a result of the impact of human activity as set out in Article 6(1), the groundwater body is so polluted that achieving good groundwater chemical status is infeasible or disproportionately expensive.

ANNEX III
(Articles 2, 6, 27)
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
The economic analysis shall contain sufficient information in sufficient detail (taking account of the costs associated with collecting the relevant data) in order to:
a) make the calculations required to take account, in accordance with Article 27, of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, taking account of long-term forecasts of supply and demand for water in the river basin district and, where necessary:

of estimates of the volume, prices and costs associated with water services, and

of estimates of relevant investment, including forecasts of such investment;
b) make a judgement about the most cost-effective combination of measures in relation to water uses to be included in the programme of measures under Articles 19-21, based on estimates of the potential costs of such measures.

ANNEX IV
(Article 8)
REGISTER OF PROTECTED AREAS

The register of protected areas required under Article 8 shall include the following types of protected areas:
i) Areas designated for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption under Article 23.
ii) Areas designated for the protection of economically significant aquatic species.
iii) Water bodies designated as recreational waters, including areas designated as bathing waters, under the legislation enacted for the purposes of harmonisation with Directive 76/160/EEC.
iv) Nutrient-sensitive areas, including areas designated as vulnerable zones under the legislation enacted for the purposes of harmonisation with Directive 91/676/EEC and areas designated as sensitive areas under the legislation enacted for the purposes of harmonisation with Directive 91/271/EEC.
v) Areas designated for the protection of habitats or species where the maintenance or improvement of the status of water is an important factor in their protection, including relevant Natura 2000 sites designated under the legislation enacted for the purposes of harmonisation with Directives 92/43/EEC and 79/409/EEC.

The summary of the register required as part of the river basin management plan shall include maps showing the location of each protected area and a description of the legislation under which they have been designated.

2.1. Quantitative status of groundwater

2.1.1. Parameter for the classification of quantitative status
Groundwater level regime

2.1.2. Definition of quantitative status

Element	Good status
Groundwater level	The level of groundwater in the groundwater body ensures that the available groundwater resource is not exceeded by the long-term annual average rate of abstraction. <br><br> Accordingly, the level of the groundwater is not subject to anthropogenic alterations such as would result in: <br> - failure to achieve the environmental objectives set out in Articles 9-17 for associated surface waters, <br> - any significant diminution in the status of such waters, <br> - any significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems which depend directly on the groundwater body, <br> and temporary, or continuous but spatially limited, alterations to the direction of flow due to changes in level may occur, but such reversals do not lead to saline or other intrusions and do not constitute a permanent and clearly identified trend, resulting from anthropogenic causes, in the alteration of the direction of flow capable of leading to such intrusions.

2.2. Monitoring of the quantitative status of groundwater
2.2.1. Groundwater level monitoring network
The groundwater monitoring network shall be established in accordance with the requirements of Articles 7 and 8. The monitoring network shall be designed so as to provide a reliable assessment of the quantitative status of all groundwater bodies or groups of bodies, including an assessment of the available groundwater resource. The competent authority shall provide one or more maps in the river basin management plan showing the groundwater monitoring network.

2.2.2. Density of monitoring points
The network shall include sufficient representative monitoring points to estimate the groundwater level in each groundwater body or group of bodies, taking account of short- and long-term variations in recharge, and in particular:

for groundwater bodies identified as being at risk of failing to achieve the environmental objectives of Articles 9-17, a sufficient density of monitoring points shall be ensured to assess the impact of abstractions and discharges on the groundwater level.

2.2.3. Frequency of monitoring
The frequency of observations shall be sufficient to allow for the assessment of the quantitative status of each groundwater body or group of bodies, taking into account short- and long-term variations in recharge, and in particular:

for groundwater bodies identified as being at risk of failing to achieve the environmental objectives of Articles 9-17, a sufficient frequency of measurements shall be ensured to assess the impact of abstractions and discharges on the groundwater level.

2.2.4. Interpretation and presentation of the quantitative status of groundwater
The results obtained from the monitoring network for a groundwater body or group of bodies shall be used to assess the quantitative status of that body or bodies. Subject to section 2.5, the competent authority shall prepare a map based on this assessment of the quantitative status of groundwater, using the following colour codes:
Good: green
Poor: red

2.3.1. Parameters for the determination of the chemical status of groundwater

Conductivity

Concentrations of pollutants

2.3.2. Definition of good groundwater chemical status

Element	Good status
General	The chemical composition of the groundwater body is such that the concentrations of pollutants: <br> - as specified below, do not exhibit the effects of saline or other intrusions, <br> - do not exceed the quality standards applicable under other relevant Community legislation in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2000/60/EC, <br> - are not such as would result in failure to achieve the environmental objectives of Articles 9-17 for associated surface waters, nor in any significant diminution of the ecological or chemical quality of such bodies, nor in any significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems which depend directly on the groundwater body.
Conductivity	Changes in conductivity do not indicate saline or other intrusion into the groundwater body.

2.4. Monitoring of the chemical status of groundwater

2.4.1. Groundwater monitoring network
The groundwater monitoring network shall be established in accordance with the requirements of Articles 23 and 24 of the Law. The monitoring network shall be designed so as to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of the chemical status of groundwater within each river basin and to detect the presence of long-term anthropogenically induced upward trends in pollutants.

On the basis of the characterisation and impact assessment carried out in accordance with Article 6 and Annex II, the competent authority shall, for each period of a river basin management plan, establish a surveillance monitoring programme. The results of this programme shall be used to establish an operational monitoring programme to be applied for the remaining period of the plan.

The plan shall provide estimates of the level of confidence and precision of the results provided by the monitoring programmes.

2.4.2. Surveillance monitoring
Objective
Surveillance monitoring shall be carried out in order to:

supplement and validate the impact assessment procedure,

provide information for use in the assessment of long-term trends due to changes in natural conditions and to human activity.

Selection of monitoring points
Sufficient monitoring points shall be selected for:

bodies which are identified as being at risk following the characterisation carried out in accordance with Annex II,

bodies which cross a Member State boundary.

Selection of parameters
The following series of core parameters shall be monitored in all selected groundwater bodies:

oxygen content,

pH value,

conductivity,

nitrate,

ammonium.
Those bodies which are identified, in accordance with Annex II, as being at significant risk of failing to achieve good status shall also be monitored for those parameters which are indicative of the impacts of those pressures.

2.4.3. Operational monitoring
Objective
Operational monitoring shall be undertaken in the periods between surveillance monitoring programmes in order to:

establish the chemical status of all groundwater bodies or groups of bodies determined to be at risk,

establish the presence of long-term anthropogenically induced upward trends in the concentration of pollutants.

Selection of monitoring points
Operational monitoring shall be carried out for all those groundwater bodies or groups of bodies which, on the basis of both the impact assessment carried out in accordance with Annex II and surveillance monitoring, are identified as being at risk of failing to meet the objectives of Articles 9-17. The selection of monitoring points shall also reflect an assessment of how representative the monitoring data from the particular point are in terms of the quality of the relevant one or more groundwater bodies.

Frequency of monitoring
Operational monitoring shall be carried out in the periods between surveillance monitoring programmes at a frequency sufficient to detect the impacts of the relevant pressures and, in any event, at least once a year.

2.4.4. Trend identification
The competent authority shall use data from both surveillance and operational monitoring to identify long-term anthropogenically induced upward trends in pollutant concentrations and the reversal of these trends. The base year or period from which such trends are calculated shall be identified. The calculation of trends shall be carried out for a body or, where appropriate, a group of groundwater bodies. The reversal of a trend shall be demonstrated statistically and the level of confidence in the identification shall be stated.

2.4.5. Interpretation and presentation of the chemical status of groundwater
In assessing status, the results of individual monitoring points within a groundwater body shall be aggregated for the body as a whole. Subject to the relevant directives, for a groundwater body to be in good status, with respect to the chemical parameters for which Community-wide environmental quality standards are set:

the mean value of the results of monitoring at each point in the body or group of groundwater bodies is calculated; and

in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2000/60/EC, these mean values are used to demonstrate compliance with good groundwater chemical status.

Subject to section 2.5, the competent authority shall produce a map of the chemical status of groundwater, using the following colour codes:
Good: green
Poor: red

The competent authority shall also indicate on the map with a black dot those groundwater bodies which are subject to a significant and sustained upward trend in the concentrations of any pollutant resulting from the impact of human activity. The reversal of a trend shall be indicated on the map with a blue dot.

These maps shall be included in the river basin management plan.

2.5. Presentation of groundwater status
The competent authority shall provide in the river basin management plan a map showing, for each groundwater body or group of bodies, both the quantitative and the chemical status of that body or group of bodies, using colour codes in accordance with the requirements of sections 2.2.4 and 2.4.5. The competent authority has the option of not producing separate maps for sections 2.2.4 and 2.4.5, but in that case, it shall also indicate, in accordance with the requirements of section 2.4.5, on the map required by this section, those bodies that are subject to a significant and sustained upward trend in the concentration of any pollutant or any reversal of that trend.

This parameter is the environmental quality standard expressed as an annual average value (AA-EQS). Unless otherwise specified, it applies to the total concentration of all isomers.

Inland surface waters cover rivers and lakes and related artificial or heavily modified water bodies.

This parameter is the environmental quality standard expressed as a maximum allowable concentration (MAC-EQS). Where 'not applicable' is indicated for the MAC-EQS, the AA-EQS values are considered to protect against short-term pollution peaks in continuous discharges as they are significantly lower than the values derived from acute toxicity.

For the group of priority substances of brominated diphenylethers (No 5), the EQS refers to the sum of the concentrations of congeners No 28, 47, 99, 100, 153 and 154.

For cadmium and its compounds (No 6) the EQS values vary depending on the water hardness, which is classified into 5 categories (Class 1: < 40 mg CaCO₃/l, Class 2: 40 to <50 mg CaCO₃/l, Class 3: 50 to <100 mg CaCO₃/l, Class 4: 100 to <200 mg CaCO₃/l, Class 5: ≥ 200 mg CaCO₃/l).

This substance is not a priority substance but one of the other pollutants for which the EQS are identical to those laid down in the legislation in force before 13 January 2009.

No indicative parameter is provided for this group of substances. The indicative parameter(s) must be defined through the analytical method.

Total DDT comprises the sum of the isomers 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2 bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (CAS number 50-29-3; EU number 200-024-3); 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (CAS number 789-02-6; EU number 212-332-5); 1,1-dichloro-2,2 bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (CAS number 72-55-9; EU number 200-784-6); and 1,1-dichloro-2,2 bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (CAS number 72-54-8; EU number 200-783-0).

There is insufficient data to set a MAC-EQS for these substances.

For the group of priority substances of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (No 28), the biota EQS and the corresponding AA-EQS in water refer to the concentration of benzo(a)pyrene, on whose toxicity they are based. Benzo(a)pyrene can be considered as a marker for the other PAHs, and therefore only benzo(a)pyrene needs to be monitored for comparison with the biota EQS or the corresponding AA-EQS in water.

The biota EQS refers to fish, unless otherwise specified. An alternative biota taxon, or another matrix, may be monitored instead of fish, provided that the EQS applied offers an equivalent level of protection. For substances No 15 (Fluoranthene) and 28 (PAHs), the biota EQS refers to crustaceans and molluscs. For the purpose of assessing chemical status, monitoring of fluoranthene and PAHs in fish is not appropriate. For substance No 37 (Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds), the biota EQS refers to fish, crustaceans and molluscs, in line with section 5.3 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1259/2011 amending Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 as regards maximum levels for dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and non-dioxin-like PCBs in foodstuffs.

These EQS refer to bioavailable concentrations of the substances.

PCDD: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins; PCDF: polychlorinated dibenzofurans; PCB-DL: dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls; TEQ: toxic equivalents according to the World Health Organisation 2005 toxic equivalency factors.

PART B: APPLICATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY STANDARDS ESTABLISHED IN PART A
1.1 Columns 4 and 5 of the table: For any given surface water body, applying the AA-EQS means that, for any representative monitoring point within the water body, the arithmetic mean of the concentrations measured at different times during the year does not exceed the standard.
1.2 The calculation of the arithmetic mean, the analytical method applied and, where no suitable analytical method meeting the minimum performance criteria exists, the method of applying the environmental quality standard shall be in accordance with the implementing acts establishing technical specifications for chemical monitoring and the quality of analytical results in accordance with the provisions of this Law and the Directive.
2.1 Columns 6 and 7 of the table: For any given surface water body, applying the MAC-EQS means that the measured concentration at any representative monitoring point within the water body does not exceed the standard.
2.2 However, in accordance with section 1.3.4 of Annex V, the competent authority may apply statistical methods, such as a percentile calculation, to ensure an acceptable level of confidence and precision for determining compliance with the MAC-EQS. In that case, such statistical methods shall comply with the detailed rules laid down pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 2 of Directive 2008/105/EC.
3.1 The environmental quality standards for water established in this Annex are expressed as total concentrations in the whole water sample.
3.2 By way of derogation from the provisions of section 3.1, in the case of cadmium, lead, mercury and nickel (hereinafter 'metals') the water environmental quality standard refers to the dissolved concentration, i.e. the dissolved phase of a water sample obtained by filtration through a 0,45 μm filter or any equivalent pre-treatment, or, where explicitly stated, to the bioavailable concentration.
3.3 The competent authority may, when assessing the monitoring results against the relevant environmental quality standards, take into account:
(a) the natural background concentrations for metals and their compounds, where such concentrations prevent compliance with the relevant environmental quality standard.
(b) the hardness, pH, dissolved organic carbon or other water quality parameters that affect the bioavailability of metals, where bioavailable concentrations are determined using appropriate bioavailability models.
