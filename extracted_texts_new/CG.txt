These modifications are the subject of riders signed under the conditions referred to in Article 62.

Article 68: In the interest of the public service, the State may deem necessary modifications to the delegation contract.

These modifications may not have as their object to impose on the delegatee a public service distinct from the public water service or to extend the duration of the delegation contract by more than one year beyond the initially fixed term.

If these modifications, due to the new charges they impose on the delegatee, significantly alter its financial equilibrium, the delegatee has the right to be compensated for the amount of its potential loss of earnings and may request the extension of the duration of the delegation contract.
