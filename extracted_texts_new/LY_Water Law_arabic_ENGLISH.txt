**Article 3**
The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya shall be divided into water districts. The Secretariat of Agrarian Reform and Land Reclamation shall undertake to survey all water sources, license exploratory and production drilling operations, monitor water, verify the purposes for which it is used, and collect all data necessary for managing water sources in each district on a sound scientific basis.

**Article 4**
The General People's Committee for Agrarian Reform and Land Reclamation shall issue the necessary decisions to implement the collective irrigation system and form the committees entrusted with its execution in the water districts.

b) It is not permissible to drink or water animals from any private water installation or one licensed for use by one or more beneficiaries, except with their prior permission and upon payment of appropriate consideration.¹
