changes cause a shortage of water for any purpose, which in
the opinion of the Minister, makes it necessary to suspend the
abstraction of water for the period stated in the Order;
by instrument in writing, revise or alter the quantity of water
which a person who has been issued a licence under section
18D or to whom section 18K applies is authorised to abstract

is used or caused or permitted to be used in contravention of
this Act; or
though not situated in any area or zone defined pursuant to
section 27 or in respect of which a restriction or prohibition
applies pursuant to that section, is used or caused or permitted
to be used for the disposal of sewage or other waste in a
manner which, in the opinion of the Committee, constitutes
or is likely to constitute a danger to health or leads or is likely
to lead to the contamination of any source of water,
the Minister may, on the recommendation of the Committee, by notice

The expenses of the Authority reasonably incurred in the exercise
of the powers conferred by subsection (2) shall be a debt due by the

other lawful means of recovery, may be recovered by the Authority on
complaint before a magistrate.
