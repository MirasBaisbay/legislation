Surface waters, in relation to chemical status under § 4a(6), exceptionally also include territorial waters. Surface waters also include waters that occur in an area protected from flooding during a flood and which cannot drain naturally during high water levels in the watercourse (hereinafter "inland water"). Waters drained by public sewerage are not considered inland waters.

(3) Groundwater is all water which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil, including groundwater serving as a medium for the accumulation, transport and exploitation of geothermal heat from the rock environment (hereinafter "geothermal water"). Groundwater remains groundwater even after it is exposed by a natural collapse of its overlying strata, by mining activities,⁴) by activities carried out in a mining-like manner,⁵) or by the performance of other similar activities.

(4) Groundwater is primarily intended for supplying the population with drinking water and for purposes for which the use of drinking water is established by a special regulation.⁶) Other uses of groundwater are possible only while preserving its priority designation.

(5) This Act shall apply to waters that are declared to be natural medicinal sources and natural sources of mineral table waters under a special regulation,⁷) and to waters that are reserved minerals under a special regulation⁸) (hereinafter "special waters"), only if it expressly so provides.

(6) Mine waters shall be considered surface waters or groundwater for the purposes of this Act, and this Act shall apply to them, unless a special regulation⁹) provides otherwise.

(7) Transitional waters are bodies of surface water in the vicinity of river mouths which are partly saline in character as a result of their proximity to coastal waters and are substantially influenced by freshwater flows.

(8) Coastal waters are surface waters on the landward side of a line every point of which is at a distance of one nautical mile on the seaward side from the nearest point of the baseline from which the breadth of territorial waters is measured and, where appropriate, extending up to the outer limit of transitional waters.

b) the assessment of the chemical status of groundwater.

(4) Good groundwater status is the status of a body of groundwater when both its quantitative status and its chemical status are classified as at least good.

(5) The quantitative status of a body of groundwater is an expression of the degree to which a body of groundwater is affected by direct and indirect abstractions of groundwater. The criteria for assessing the quantitative status of a body of groundwater and the classification of the quantitative status of a body of groundwater are established by a generally binding legal regulation pursuant to § 81(1)(h).

(6) The assessment of the quantitative status of groundwater includes
a) an assessment of the hydrological regime of groundwater and an assessment of its long-term and short-term changes and an assessment of trends,
b) a balance of groundwater quantities (hereinafter "water balance").

(7) The quantitative status of a body of groundwater is considered to be good if
a) the established available groundwater resources are not exceeded by the long-term average annual rate of abstraction,
b) there is no significant sustained downward trend in groundwater levels in the body of groundwater caused by anthropogenic impacts,
c) there is no significant deterioration in the status of bodies of surface water caused by a drop in groundwater levels or by changes in groundwater flow,
d) there is no significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems due to a drop in groundwater levels,
e) there is no expansion of the intrusion of pollutants or any other undesirable sustained deterioration of the chemical status of the body of groundwater, induced by changes in groundwater flow,
f) changes in the direction of flow resulting from changes in groundwater levels occur temporarily or permanently only in a spatially limited area,
g) the changes under letter f) do not cause the entry of pollutants and do not indicate a clearly identifiable trend in the direction of flow caused by anthropogenic impacts which could lead to such an entry of pollutants.

(8) The chemical status of groundwater is an expression of the degree to which water quality is affected by pollutants. For the purpose of assessing the chemical status of a body or group of bodies of groundwater, the following criteria are used:
a) groundwater quality standards according to Appendix No. 1a,
b) threshold values established by a generally binding legal regulation pursuant to § 81(1)(j).

(9) The assessment of the chemical status of bodies of groundwater, including consideration of the exceeding of groundwater quality standards or threshold values at individual monitoring sites, shall be carried out according to the procedure established in the generally binding legal regulation pursuant to § 81(1)(i). A summary of the chemical status assessment shall be published in the river basin management plans according to the procedure established in the generally binding legal regulation pursuant to § 81(2)(b).

(10) Good chemical status of groundwater is the chemical status of a body of groundwater determined according to the criteria established by a generally binding legal regulation pursuant to § 81(1)(i).

(11) Groundwater threshold values must be established in accordance with the conditions under subsection 13 for pollutants, groups of pollutants and indicators of pollution which have been identified as a factor contributing to the characterisation of a body of groundwater or a group of bodies of groundwater as bodies at risk of failing to achieve good groundwater chemical status, based at least on the List of pollutants or ions and their indicators in Appendix No. 1b. If the monitoring results at representative monitoring sites exceed the threshold values, this will indicate a risk of failing to meet one or more of the conditions for achieving good groundwater chemical status as established in the generally binding regulation issued pursuant to § 81(1)(i).

(12) The threshold values for the classification of good chemical status are based on the protection of bodies of groundwater pursuant to subsection 13, taking into account in particular their impact on and interrelationship with associated surface waters and directly dependent terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands, and also taking into account, inter alia, toxicological and ecotoxicological knowledge.

(13) In establishing threshold values, the following conditions must be taken into account:

**§ 16**
**Specifics of Determining Environmental Objectives**

(1) The environmental objectives set to achieve good surface water status and good groundwater status must be ensured by implementing the programme of measures established in the river basin management plan by 22 December 2015.

(2) The deadline under subsection 1 may be extended if
a) the improvement of the status of water bodies can only be achieved by technical measures in stages that exceed this deadline,
b) the measures to improve the status of water bodies according to the timetable require disproportionate costs for their implementation,
c) natural conditions do not allow for the improvement of the status of water bodies within this deadline.

(3) The deadline under subsection 1 may be extended for a maximum of the period established for carrying out two reviews of the river basin management plans under § 13(5), except in cases where natural conditions do not allow the achievement of the environmental objectives during this period; the extension of deadlines may only be carried out for the purpose of progressively achieving the environmental objectives, provided that no further deterioration of the status of the affected body of water occurs. The extension of the deadline and its justification must be part of the river basin management plan, stating the measures necessary to progressively achieve the required status of the body of surface water or body of groundwater by the expiry of the extended deadline.

(4) Less stringent environmental objectives, which are reviewed every six years, may be set for bodies of surface water and for bodies of groundwater whose natural status or status altered by human activity is such that achieving the environmental objectives is technically unfeasible or represents disproportionate costs; this method of determination applies if
a) the environmental and socio-economic needs served by such human activity cannot be achieved by other means which are a significantly better environmental option not entailing disproportionate costs,
b) it is ensured that
1. the surface water achieves the best possible ecological and chemical status, having regard to the impacts that could not be avoided due to the nature of the human activity or pollution,
2. the changes to the good status of groundwater, having regard to the impacts that could not be avoided due to the human activity or pollution, will be the smallest possible,
c) no further deterioration in the status of the affected body of water occurs.

(5) The provision of subsection 4 shall not apply to environmental objectives intended to prevent the deterioration of the status of bodies of surface water, nor to the progressive reduction of pollution of surface waters and groundwater by priority substances and the cessation or phasing out of emissions, discharges and losses of priority hazardous substances.

(6) A failure to achieve environmental objectives shall not be considered as such if
a) there is a temporary deterioration in the status of water bodies as a result of exceptional circumstances of a natural origin or other unforeseeable natural circumstances, in particular floods, prolonged drought or an extraordinary deterioration in water quality (hereinafter "exceptional circumstance"), provided that all of the following conditions are met simultaneously:
1. appropriate measures are taken to prevent further deterioration of the status of the body of surface water or the status of the body of groundwater, and which do not jeopardise the achievement of environmental objectives in other bodies of surface water or bodies of groundwater not affected by these exceptional circumstances,
2. the river basin management plan contains the conditions and a description of the indicators under which circumstances may be designated as exceptional circumstances,
3. the programme of measures contains the measures to be taken in exceptional circumstances; these measures must not jeopardise the restoration of the original status of the body of surface water or body of groundwater after the end of the exceptional circumstances,
4. the effects of the exceptional circumstances are reviewed annually and, taking into account the environmental objectives, measures are taken to restore the status of the body of surface water or body of groundwater to that which existed before the exceptional circumstances as soon as possible,
5. a summary of the effects of the exceptional circumstances and the measures under points 1 to 4 is included in the next updated river basin management plan,
b) the failure to achieve good groundwater status, good ecological status or good ecological potential, or to prevent deterioration in the status of a body of surface water or groundwater, is the result of new modifications to the physical characteristics of a body of surface water or alterations to the level of bodies of groundwater, or if the failure to prevent deterioration of a surface water body from very good status to good status is the result of new sustainable human development activities and all of the following conditions are met simultaneously:
1. all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the body of surface water or the status of the body of groundwater,
2. the reasons for the modifications or alterations to the bodies of surface water or bodies of groundwater are specifically set out and explained in the river basin management plan (§ 13) and the environmental objectives are reviewed every six years,
3. the reasons for these modifications or alterations are of overriding public interest and/or the benefits to the environment and to society of achieving the objectives under subsection 1 are outweighed by the benefits of the new modifications or alterations to human health, the maintenance of human safety or to sustainable development, and
4. the beneficial objectives served by those modifications or alterations of the water body cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option.

(7) If monitoring of the status of surface waters and groundwater reveals that the environmental objectives set for a body of water cannot be achieved, it is necessary to
a) examine the causes preventing the fulfilment of the environmental objectives,
b) review the issued permit for the special use of waters,
c) review and update the water monitoring programmes,

(1) A permit from the state water administration authority is required for the construction of a water structure, its modification, change in use, abolition or removal of a water structure; unless this Act provides otherwise. A permit for a water structure may be issued only if a permit for the special use of waters has been issued, if required under this Act, or the permit for the special use of waters is permitted at the latest with the building permit. For carrying out structural modifications to a water structure, a notification to the state water administration authority is sufficient. The state water administration authority may determine that a notified structural modification can only be carried out on the basis of a building permit. A special regulation applies to proceedings concerning the notification.³¹b) For the construction of a simple water facility, neither a permit from the state water administration authority nor a notification to the state water administration authority is required.

(2) In the permit for water structures, the state water administration authority shall specify binding conditions³²) for the construction of the structure and the use of the structure.

(3) For water structures, the state water administration authority has the competence of a building authority under a special regulation³³) with the exception of competence in matters of land-use planning decisions and expropriation. The state water administration authority which is competent to permit a water structure shall also decide on the use of the structure by issuing an occupancy and use permit.³⁴)

(4) A permit from the state water administration authority for the construction, modification or removal of a water structure is at the same time a building permit,³⁵) and a permit for its commissioning is at the same time an occupancy and use permit.³⁶) A condition for issuing a building permit for an operationally related public water supply system³²a) or an operationally related public sewerage system³²b) is a written contract under a special regulation.³²c) A condition for issuing an occupancy and use permit for a public water supply system or a public sewerage system is a written contract under a special regulation.³²d)

(5) When permitting, constructing and operating water structures, it is necessary to continuously monitor and evaluate their impact on surface waters and groundwater and to take into account the interests of fisheries and the protection of nature and the landscape, and to ensure that the use of one natural property of water does not make it impossible to use other natural properties of water. A new water structure must ensure the protection of fisheries and the two-way natural migration of fish and other aquatic animals; this shall not apply in the case of fishponds, fish farming facilities located outside the channel of a watercourse or small water reservoirs particularly suitable for fish farming, and water structures, if this cannot be ensured for reasons under § 16(6). In the event of a conflict of interests in the use of the natural properties of water, the state water administration authority may make the permit for the construction of a water structure conditional on
a) its usability for multiple purposes, utilising several natural properties of water for several users,
b) the conclusion of an agreement by several owners on the construction of a joint water structure and the conclusion of an agreement on its future operation.

(6) A special regulation shall apply to the permitting of tailings ponds which serve as a disposal site for the disposal of extractive waste.³⁶a)

(7) If it is not possible to establish water structures by which a channel is regulated, modified or created, flood protection water structures, dams, reservoirs, water structures which are established for navigation purposes on another's real property through the transfer or assignment of ownership right or the establishment of an easement, the necessary real property or right thereto may, if it cannot be acquired by agreement, be expropriated in the public interest under a special regulation.³⁷)

(8) When permitting the construction of a public water supply pipeline or a public sewerage network outside the built-up area of a municipality, the state water administration authority shall decide on the conditions under which they may be constructed and operated on another's land; the rights of the builder to construct the water structure arise upon the entry into force of such a decision. For a water structure permitted under the preceding sentence, a protection zone for the public water supply pipeline

or the public sewerage network pipeline shall be defined in accordance with a special regulation³⁷a) based on the location of the water structure according to the conditions of the land-use planning decision. A water structure and the protection zone of a water structure under this subsection and the obligations related thereto³⁷a) are easements associated with the ownership of the land.

(9) Owners are entitled to compensation for the restriction of ownership rights to land under subsections 7 and 8 according to a special regulation.³⁷) In disputes over compensation, a court shall decide.

(10) If a permit for the special use of waters expires or is cancelled, the state water administration authority may decide on the conditions for the further retention or removal of the water structure which enabled the permitted handling of water.

(11) For the removal or modification of a water structure that no longer fulfils its function, for the purpose of regulating, modifying or creating the channel of a watercourse that is not a monitored waterway or a prospectively monitored waterway, with the aim of restoring the natural channel of the watercourse, a notification by the owner of the water structure to the state water administration authority is sufficient. The provisions of special regulations shall apply mutatis mutandis to the notification of the removal or modification of a water structure;³⁷aaa) an annex to the notification shall be a consenting binding opinion of the watercourse administrator.

(12) A water structure does not fulfil its function, in particular if
a) the water structure no longer fulfils any of the purposes for which it was established or for which a permit for special use of waters was issued, and it also does not fulfil a function related to flood protection, or
b) the permit for the special use of waters has expired.

(13) The removal or modification of a water structure on the basis of a notification under subsection 11 must not cause a significant deterioration of the ecological functions of the watercourse, a significant deterioration of the ecological status of the watercourse under § 4a(4), nor a deterioration of flood protection.

(14) If the entity in whose favour the permit was issued has ceased to exist and the water structure has not passed to a subsequent acquirer (§ 22(1)), the watercourse administrator may submit a proposal for the removal or modification of a water structure that no longer fulfils its function to the state water administration authority by notification.

(15) If the notification by the owner of the water structure for the removal or modification of the water structure does not meet the conditions under subsections 11 to 14 or does not contain the required documents even after the expiry of the deadline set by the state water administration authority for their completion or correction, the state water administration authority shall determine that the notified structural modification can only be carried out on the basis of a permit.

(1) Anyone who carries out an activity that may affect the status of surface waters and groundwater and water conditions is obliged to make the necessary effort to preserve and protect them.

(2) The owner, administrator or tenant of agricultural land and forest land is obliged to manage it in a way that not only preserves suitable conditions for the occurrence of water but also helps to improve water conditions; in particular, they are obliged to prevent harmful changes in run-off conditions, soil erosion, and to care for the maintenance of soil water and the improvement of the retention capacity of the area.

(3) The state water administration authority may impose on the owners, administrators or tenants of agricultural land and forest land the implementation of measures aimed at fulfilling the obligations specified in subsection 2.

**§ 31**
**Protected Water Management Area**

A protected water management area is regulated by a special act.⁴⁰)

**§ 32**
**Protection Zones of Water Resources**

(1) To protect the yield, quality and health safety of the water of water resources that are used, the state water administration authority shall designate protection zones on the basis of an opinion from the public health authority.⁴⁴) If required by serious circumstances, the state water administration authority may also designate protection zones for available water resources and for water resources designated for abstraction for drinking water with a capacity lower than that of defined water resources. The designated protection zones are at the same time sanitary protection zones.

(2) The protection zones of water resources are divided into a protection zone of the I degree, which serves for its protection in the immediate vicinity of the water abstraction point or catchment facility, and a protection zone of the II degree, which serves to protect the water resource from threats from more distant places. To increase the protection of the water resource, the state water administration authority may also designate a protection zone of the III degree.

(3) If the conditions in the territory of the protection zone of the I degree provide sufficient protection for the yield, quality and health safety of the water resource, further degrees of protection zones are not designated.

(4) The proposal for the designation of protection zones of a water resource must be submitted by the person who has a permit for water abstraction, or the person who is applying for a permit for water abstraction from the water resource. For abstractions of water from water supply reservoirs, the proposal for the designation of protection zones must be submitted by the administrator of water-management significant watercourses or the builder of the water structure used for impounding water in this water supply reservoir. A part of the proposal for the designation of protection zones of a water resource shall be the final report from a detailed hydrogeological survey and a geometric plan, if the lands forming the protection zone of the water resource of the I degree are being divided or merged.

(5) The decision on the designation of protection zones of a water resource shall determine their boundaries and the manner of protection, in particular prohibitions or restrictions on activities that damage or threaten the quantity and quality of water or the health safety of the water of the water resource, as well as technical adjustments for the protection of the water resource and other measures to be implemented in the protection zone. The rights and obligations arising from decisions on the designation of protection zones of a water resource shall pass to the subsequent acquirer or user of the property with which these rights and obligations are associated.

(6) For the proven restriction of the use of land in the protection zones of water resources, the owner of the land is entitled to compensation for material damage to a reasonable and demonstrable extent, which the person who abstracts water, or the person who applies for a permit for water abstraction from the water resource, is obliged to provide upon their request;⁴⁵a) in the case of a water supply reservoir, the owner or builder of the water structure used for impounding water in the water supply reservoir. The material damage may be compensated on the basis of an agreement on determining the amount for an annual, or longer period, or an agreement on a one-off compensation. If an agreement is not reached, the amount of material damage shall be determined on the basis of an expert opinion under a special regulation.⁴⁶) When determining the amount of material damage by agreement or expert opinion, this compensation to the owner of agricultural land and forest land must be reduced by the share of costs related to the management of this land under § 30(2) and (3). Land in the protection zone of the I degree may be expropriated in the public interest.³⁷)

(7) The costs associated with technical adjustments for the protection of the water resource must be borne by the person who abstracts water, or the person who applies for a permit for water abstraction from the water resource; in the case of water supply reservoirs, by the administrator of water-management significant watercourses or the builder of the water structure used for impounding water.

(8) A court shall decide in disputes concerning the payment of material damage and the bearing of costs associated with technical adjustments.

(9) The state water administration authority may change the decision on the designation of protection zones of a water resource or replace it with a new decision and for this purpose also call upon the entities mentioned in subsection 4 to submit an application; if the reasons for the protection of the water resource have ceased to exist, it shall cancel the issued decision. When changing the boundaries of the protection zones of the I degree, the entities mentioned in subsection 4 shall attach a geometric plan to the application under the conditions of subsection 4.

(10) The owner of agricultural and forest land is not entitled to assign claims against the obliged entities mentioned in subsection 6, to provide them as a bank guarantee or other guarantee, or to otherwise transfer them to third parties.

(11) The protection zones shall be reflected in the solution for the spatial arrangement of the territory and the functional use of the territory.⁴⁶aa)

**§ 32a**
**Reference Site**

(1) A reference site represents the condition that would exist in a watercourse without the influence of human activity or with minimal influence of human activity. The condition of a reference site forms the basis for quantifying the disturbance of the aquatic environment and for assessing the status of surface waters. A reference site consists of a section of a watercourse one kilometre upstream from the sampling point marked by a river kilometre.

(2) The criteria by which a reference site is determined are
a) the condition of the channel, banks and riparian zone,
b) the hydrological regime,
c) land use,
d) water quality given by physico-chemical indicators,
e) the presence of introduced species or intensive fish farming.

(3) The catchment of a reference site is the part of the territory of a sub-basin from which all surface run-off flows through watercourses to the sampling point of the reference site.

(4) It is prohibited to carry out any activity in a reference site that would disturb the existing condition. It is prohibited to carry out any activity in the catchment of a reference site that would disturb the existing condition, except for carrying out activities under a special regulation.⁴⁶a)

(5) A reference site is marked with a sign, which is placed in a visible location on one of the banks of the watercourse at a specific river kilometre.

(6) The Ministry is obliged to notify in writing the owner, administrator and tenant of the land to which the intention pertains of its intention to declare a reference site. The notification of the intention shall contain a basic characterisation of the intention to declare a reference site, the restrictions resulting from the declaration of a reference site, and a draft agreement on determining the amount and manner of providing compensation for the restriction of ownership rights.

(7) If an agreement on determining the amount and manner of providing compensation for the restriction of ownership rights is not concluded within 90 days of the notification of the intention under subsection 6, the Ministry is entitled to file a motion with a court for a decision on the amount and manner of providing compensation for the restriction of ownership rights.

The basic requirements for the preparation of the Programme of Agricultural Activities are set out in Part B of Appendix No. 5.

(4) The Ministry of Agriculture shall issue and regularly review the Programme of Agricultural Activities at intervals not longer than four years according to the results of water quality monitoring and shall monitor its implementation.

**§ 36**
**Discharge of Waste Water and Special Waters into Surface Waters**

(1) Municipal waste waters must, before being discharged into surface waters or groundwater, undergo treatment which ensures, in the manner specified in subsections 2 and 3, the required limit values of the pollution indicators of these discharged waters, depending on the size of the pollution source.

(2) Municipal waste waters originating in agglomerations of more than 2,000 population equivalents must be collected and treated only by a public sewerage system. Where the construction of a public sewerage system provides no environmental benefit or entails disproportionately high costs, individual systems or other appropriate systems may be used which achieve the same level of environmental protection as the collection of waste waters by a public sewerage system. Such systems are, in particular, watertight cesspools or small waste water treatment plants. The use of an individual system or another appropriate system shall be justified by the state administration authority in the permit for watertight cesspools and by the state water administration authority for small waste water treatment plants. The handling of waste waters accumulated in watertight cesspools shall be in accordance with a special regulation,⁴⁶b) and they must be disposed of in a waste water treatment plant.

(3) The handling of municipal waste waters originating in agglomerations of less than 2,000 population equivalents which do not have a public sewerage system without appropriate treatment, or in sparsely populated areas outside agglomerations, may, in addition to a public sewerage system, also be addressed by individual systems or other appropriate systems, which are in particular watertight cesspools and, for sparsely populated areas, also small waste water treatment plants with appropriate treatment, so as to achieve the environmental objectives for surface waters and groundwater in accordance with § 5. The handling of waste waters accumulated in watertight cesspools shall be in accordance with a special regulation,⁴⁶b) and they must be disposed of in a waste water treatment plant.

(4) A permit for the construction of another appropriate system or an individual system under subsections 2 and 3 may be issued only for a fixed period. In localities where a public sewerage system is built and operational, this permit will not be extended after its expiry. Anyone who accumulates waste water in a cesspool is obliged to ensure its disposal by transport to a waste water treatment plant and, upon a call from the municipality⁴⁷) or the state water administration authority, to submit documents on the transport of waste water for at most the last two years. The transport of waste water may be carried out only by the operator of a public sewerage system,⁴⁷a) a municipality, or a person authorised under a special regulation.⁴⁷b) Anyone who carries out the transport of waste water is obliged to issue a document on the transport to the person who requested the transport; the document on the transport of waste water shall contain the name, surname and address of the person to whom the waste water transport was carried out, the date of transport, the location of the cesspool, the quantity of waste water transported, the name of the person who carried out the transport, and the address of the waste water treatment plant.

(5) An agglomeration is an area where the population and/or economic activities are sufficiently concentrated for municipal waste water to be collected and conducted to a waste water treatment plant or to a final discharge point.

(6) In agglomerations of 2,000 to 10,000 population equivalents which do not have a public sewerage system, and in agglomerations of less than 2,000 population equivalents which have a public sewerage system without appropriate treatment, the discharge of municipal waste waters under subsection 1 shall be ensured by 31 December 2015, and in agglomerations of more than 10,000 population equivalents by 31 December 2010, according to the National Programme of the Slovak Republic for the implementation of Council Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban waste-water treatment, as amended by Commission Directive 98/15/EC, Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 1137/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

(7) Municipal waste waters and organically polluted industrial waste waters discharged into surface waters must, before their discharge, undergo secondary treatment, or appropriate treatment, which will guarantee the limit values of pollution under normal climatic conditions. In high-mountain environments, where the efficiency of biological treatment is very low, this stage of treatment may be omitted if an expert assessment demonstrates that there will be no adverse impact on the environment.

(8) When permitting the discharge of waste waters and special waters into surface waters, the state water administration authority is, with regard to emission controls, bound by the established indicators expressing the status of surface waters, the pollution limit values in waste waters and special waters, and the quality requirements for surface waters, while taking into account the need for
a) ensuring a satisfactory status of surface waters and groundwater, aquatic ecosystems, the protection of fisheries and water-dependent landscape ecosystems,
b) reducing the pollution of waste waters at the point of their origin and the possibility of reusing waste waters.

(9) The monitoring of the permissible pollution values of waste waters and special waters permitted by the state water administration authority under subsection 8 shall be carried out by taking their samples and analyses, which shall be performed by an accredited laboratory.

(10) The pollution limit values for direct discharge into waters without prior treatment in a waste water treatment plant shall normally apply at the point where the emissions leave the installation, and no dilution shall be taken into account when determining them; for indirect discharge into waters, the effect of a waste water treatment plant may be taken into account when determining the pollution limit value for the installation concerned, provided that an equivalent level of protection of the environment as a whole is guaranteed and that this does not lead to higher levels of pollution in the environment. In the interest of protecting waters and water conditions, the state water administration authority may set permissible pollution values for discharged waste waters and special waters that are stricter than the pollution limit values, or set additional permissible pollution values.

(11) The permissible pollution values of waste waters and special waters cannot be achieved by their dilution with other waters; this does not apply to waste waters discharged from the technological facilities of nuclear power plants.

(12) If all measures are taken to prevent or mitigate the adverse impact of discharged waste waters or special waters on the status of the water in the receiving water body, the state water administration authority may permit, for a specified period, the discharge of waste waters and special waters into surface waters exceptionally in excess of the pollution limit values during
a) the trial operation of a waste water treatment plant,
b) repairs and structural modifications of a waste water treatment plant, sewer network or its structures for a maximum of six months,
c) failures of technical equipment and other operational failures of waste water treatment plant structures.

(13) Waste waters from storm water overflows may be discharged into surface waters within the scope of the permitted discharge of waste waters from the public sewerage system during periods of torrential rain. When constructing and operating a sewer network, measures must be taken, taking into account local conditions, to mitigate the adverse impact of discharged waste waters on the receiving water body according to the implementing regulation.¹⁰) Torrential rain is a rain of short duration with high intensity, which has a small area coverage.

(14) Waste waters from medical facilities intended for the treatment of communicable diseases, the handling or processing of infectious material containing causative agents of waterborne diseases must be disinfected after treatment before their discharge. To ensure increased protection of waters, the state water administration authority may also require the disinfection of waste waters from other medical facilities and facilities producing infectious waters.

(15) The discharge of sewage sludge and the contents of cesspools into surface waters and groundwater is prohibited. Sewage sludge must be handled in such a way as to minimise adverse effects on the environment.

(16) The provision of subsection 8 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the special use of waters permitted under § 21(1)(f), if the discharged waters contain pollutants.

(17) The discharge of surface run-off into surface waters may be permitted only if facilities for the collection of floating substances have been built. The discharge of surface run-off into surface waters containing pollutants that may adversely affect the quality of surface waters may be permitted only if facilities that ensure their collection have also been built.

(18) A small waste water treatment plant for up to 50 population equivalents is a set of structures and equipment for the treatment of domestic waste waters before their discharge into surface waters or groundwater, or before their other use, with a size of up to 50 population equivalents and an inflow of less than 10 m³/day.

(19) Details on the categories of small waste water treatment plants for up to 50 population equivalents, the minimum efficiency of small waste water treatment plants for up to 50 population equivalents, the limit values of pollution indicators for discharged domestic waste waters into surface waters and groundwater, the operation of a small waste water treatment plant for up to 50 population equivalents, the operating log and the inspection technician for checking the condition and functionality of a small waste water treatment plant for up to 50 population equivalents, the certificate for the inspection technician, and the minimum requirements for education and practice for the inspection technician shall be established by a regulation issued by the Government.

**§ 37**
**Discharge of Waste Water and Special Waters into Groundwater**

(1) The state water administration authority shall issue a permit for the discharge of waste waters or special waters into groundwater only after a prior investigation, which may only be carried out by an authorised person.⁴⁸) The prior investigation shall focus in particular on
a) examining and assessing the hydrogeological conditions of the relevant area,
b) assessing the self-purifying capacities of the soil and rock environment of the given locality in the specific area,
c) examining and assessing the possible risks of pollution and deterioration of groundwater quality.

A watercourse also includes waters in oxbow lakes, dead arms and abandoned arms, if they are influenced by the hydrological regime of the watercourse, as well as waters artificially impounded in the channel. A watercourse also remains surface water, part of which flows below the earth's surface or through covered sections.

(2) If a watercourse flows over land that is registered in the real estate cadastre as a water area with the land use designation as a watercourse,⁵⁶) this land is the channel. If a watercourse flows over land that is not so registered in the real estate cadastre, the channel is the land forming the bed and banks within which the waters flow up to the bank line.

(3) A natural channel is a longitudinally bounded earth surface that was formed by the action of flowing water and other natural factors. The channel of a regulated watercourse is also considered a natural channel.

(4) A regulated channel is the channel of an originally natural watercourse whose route, longitudinal profile or cross-section has been altered by deliberate human activity.

(5) An artificial channel is a channel whose bed and banks are artificially created and into which water is diverted, in particular a water canal, a mill race and a waterway.

(6) The bank line of a natural channel is the intersection of the water level with the adjacent land, up to which the water can flow between the banks without spilling over into the adjacent territory. The bank line of an artificial channel is specified in the documentation of the structural modifications.

(7) River material in the channel is part of the watercourse.

(8) In case of doubt as to whether it is a watercourse, a natural channel or an artificial channel, and as to the boundary of the channel, the state water administration authority shall decide on the basis of knowledge of the natural conditions, taking into account the bank lines of adjacent sections of the watercourse.
