Art. 149. — The tariff for the public sanitation service is based on the principle of progressive tariffs according to user categories and water consumption brackets corresponding to the public drinking water supply service, in order to take into account the importance, nature, and pollutant load of the effluents discharged into the wastewater collection network.

Art. 150. — For each tariff zone, the progressive tariff scale is determined by the application of coefficients to the base tariff calculated according to the cost parameters defined in Article 139 of this law.

Art. 151. — The invoicing to users for the provision of the public sanitation service is established on the basis of a tariff scale per territorial tariff zone; it comprises two terms:

a variable part, of an amount proportional to the volume of water invoiced under the public drinking water supply service;

a fixed part called a fixed subscription fee, of an amount covering all or part of the maintenance costs of the individual connection and the commercial management of users.

Art. 152. — For collective residential buildings, invoicing is established according to the procedures defined in Article 146 of this law.
