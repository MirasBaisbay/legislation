**Explanatory Memorandum**

Lebanon enjoys a wealth of water resources represented by rivers, springs, lakes, wells, groundwater, and basins. This highlights the need to establish a modern law to regulate this vital utility for the Lebanese State.

Whereas the legislation governing this sector is outdated, mostly dating back to the period before the declaration of independence in 1943, with some originating from the Ottoman occupation of Lebanon and others from the French Mandate era, which, starting from 1920, issued a series of legal acts, most notably Decision No. 144 of June 10, 1925, concerning public property, Decision No. 320 of May 26, 1926, concerning public property and its preservation, and the Land Property Law issued by Decision No. 3339 of 12/11/1930.

Also, after the declaration of independence, several pieces of legislation were issued to regulate this sector. However, given the evolution of legal and scientific concepts and the means of water use, this legislation has become insufficient, necessitating the enactment of a modern water law that takes into account recent developments and the urgent need to preserve this essential resource, and that ensures the meeting of the Lebanese society's needs from this vital natural resource.

Hence, the Ministry of Energy and Water, in cooperation with the competent administrations, prepared a draft water law, the preparation of which took more than ten years. The draft law was referred to the Parliament for study and approval.

Accordingly, the Committee of Public Works, Transport, Energy, and Water began studying the draft law and formed a sub-committee that devoted itself to discussing it and making the required amendments, in the presence of the competent ministries and administrations, especially the Ministry of Energy and Water, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Finance, the Council for Development and Reconstruction, and the Higher Council for Privatization.

Whereas the said committee was on the verge of completing the required amendments to the text of the draft law, but due to the convening of the CEDRE Conference (1), which was dedicated to supporting Lebanon by financing development and infrastructure projects, there was an urgent need to pass the water law before the Prime Minister and the accompanying ministerial delegation headed to the said conference. This prompted the Parliament to vote on the text of the draft law as it came from the government, resulting in the issuance of Law No. 77/2018 (The Water Law).

Whereas the Water Law in the form in which it was issued is flawed with many gaps that make its application almost impossible, therefore, the text of the attached proposed law was prepared in cooperation and coordination with all concerned ministries and administrations in order to fill the said gaps and ensure consistency between the articles of the Water Law.

Whereas the attached text was reached after numerous meetings and lengthy discussions, and it addresses the gaps and problems that marred Law No. 77 (The Water Law) in a way that ensures its proper application, with the consensus of the representatives of the concerned ministries.

For all these reasons, we submit to your esteemed council the attached proposed law in its amended form, hoping for its approval.
