7.  If any party in areas of irrigation water use is exposed to the dangers of flash floods and floods during field operations, and there is a fear of harm to lives and property that requires urgent action in the public interest, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation has the right to take what it deems appropriate of such measures, including demolishing or breaching any facility or removing or erecting any barriers, within the narrowest limits that enable it to prevent or avert this damage.
