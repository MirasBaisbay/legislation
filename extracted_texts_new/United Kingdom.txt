between water enterprises;

the relative weight to be given to the criteria.

be served in accordance with the code issued under section 63AF.
(11) In the case of a notice served as mentioned in subsection (9)(a), the supply
by the new licensee is to be treated as having begun on the date on which the
previous licensee ceased to supply the premises.
(12) Supplies of water under this section are subject to sections 60 to 63.
63AD Interim duty: supplementary
(1) A water undertaker is not required by virtue of section 63AC to provide a supply
of water to any premises if the provision of the supply would—
(a)
require the undertaker, in order to meet all its existing obligations to
supply water for domestic or other purposes, together with its probable
future obligations to supply buildings and parts of buildings with water
for domestic purposes, to incur unreasonable expenditure in carrying
out works, or
(b)
otherwise put at risk its ability to meet any of the existing or probable
future obligations mentioned in paragraph (a).
(2) The Authority may determine, in a case referred to it by the owner or occupier
of the premises in question, whether the condition in subsection (1) is satisfied
in relation to a water undertaker.
(3) Before the Authority determines whether that condition is satisfied, it must
consult—
(a)
the Secretary of State, in the case of a water undertaker whose area is
wholly or mainly in England;
(b)
the Welsh Ministers, in the case of a water undertaker whose area is
wholly or mainly in Wales.
(4) The supply of water to any premises by a water undertaker under section 63AC
does not prevent a proposed supply to those premises by that undertaker under
section 55 from being regarded as a new supply for the purposes of that section.
(5) Where a duty is imposed by section 63AC(2), or by virtue of a direction given
under section 63AC(3), in respect of any premises, any breach of the duty
which causes the owner or occupier of the premises to sustain loss or damage
is actionable at the suit of that owner or occupier.
(6) But in any proceedings brought against a water undertaker or water supply
licensee in pursuance of subsection (5), it is a defence for the undertaker or
licensee to show that the undertaker or, as the case may be, the licensee took
all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid the breach.
(7) For the purposes of section 63AC, premises which are outside a water
undertaker's area are to be treated as being within that area if they are supplied
with water using the undertaker's supply system.
(8) In subsection (7), the reference to the undertaker's supply system is to be
construed in accordance with section 17B.

Duties of undertakers to supply water supply licensees etc
66A Use of water undertaker's supply system
(1) This section applies where a water supply licensee with a retail authorisation
(“L”) requests a water undertaker to permit the use of the undertaker's supply
system for the purpose of supplying water to premises that—
(a)
L is to supply in accordance with L's retail authorisation, and
(b)
are in the area of the undertaker.
(2) This section also applies where a water supply licensee with a restricted
retail authorisation (“R”) requests a water undertaker to permit the use of the
undertaker's supply system for the purpose of supplying water to premises
that—
(a)
R is to supply in accordance with R's restricted retail authorisation,
and
(b)
are in the area of the undertaker.
(3) Where this section applies, the undertaker must in accordance with a
section 66D agreement take such steps—
(a)
for the purpose of connecting the premises in question with the
undertaker's supply system, or
(b)
in respect of that system,
as may be provided for in that agreement in order to enable the requested
use of the undertaker's supply system.
(4) A water undertaker is not required by this section to permit the use of its
supply system, or to take any steps to enable its use, if the first or second
ground applies.
(5) The first ground is that—
(a)
in the case of a request under subsection (1), the water supply
licensee has not secured by means of—
(i) a request under section 66AA(1) made by the licensee,
(ii) a request under section 66B(1) or 66C(1), (2) or (3) made
by the licensee or another water supply licensee, or

(ii) a combination of such requests,
a supply of water, or the introduction of a supply of water, in
connection with which the premises in question are to be supplied.
(6) The second ground is that there is, in relation to the water fittings used or
to be used in connection with—
(a)
the supply of water to the premises in question, or
(b)
the use of water in those premises,
a contravention of such of the requirements of regulations under section 74
as are prescribed for the purposes of this subsection.
(7) Where—
(a)
a request has been made by a water supply licensee for the purposes
of subsection (1) or (2), and
(b)
the steps which the undertaker is required to take by virtue of that
request include steps for the purpose of obtaining any necessary
authority for, or agreement to, any exercise by it of any of its powers
or the carrying out by it of any works,
the failure of the undertaker to acquire the necessary authority or agreement
does not affect the liability of the licensee to reimburse the undertaker in
respect of some or all of the expenses incurred by it in taking those steps, if
the section 66D agreement provides for such liability as regards those steps.
(8) For the purposes of this section and sections 66AA to 66C—
(a)
premises which are outside a water undertaker's area are to be treated
as being within that area if they are supplied with water using the
undertaker's supply system, and
(b)
any pipes of the water undertaker which are used for the purpose of
supplying premises as mentioned in paragraph (a) are to be treated
as being part of the undertaker's supply system (if they would not
otherwise be part of it).
(9) In this section and sections 66AA to 66C—
(a)
“prescribed” means, in relation to a water undertaker whose area
is wholly or mainly in Wales, prescribed by regulations made by
the Welsh Ministers by statutory instrument, which is subject to
annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the Assembly;
(b)
a reference to the supply system of a water undertaker is to be
construed in accordance with section 17B;
(c)
references to a retail authorisation or a restricted retail authorisation
are to be construed in accordance with Schedule 2A.

(“L”) requests a water undertaker to provide L with a supply of water for the
purpose of supplying water to premises that—
(a)
L is to supply in accordance with L's retail authorisation, and
(b)

the supply to be made by L or, as the case may be, R to those
premises is for purposes other than domestic purposes.
(6) The second ground is that provision of a supply of water by the water
undertaker would—
(a)
require the undertaker, in order to meet all its existing obligations
to supply water for domestic or other purposes, together with
its probable future obligations to supply buildings and parts of
buildings with water for domestic purposes, to incur unreasonable
expenditure in carrying out works, or
(b)
