" The administrative court is competent to rule on disputes relating to this indemnity.
" V. - This article is applicable to hydraulic development works and hydraulic structures regardless of the date on which they were authorized or granted. "

**Article 6 of the Law of 30 December 2006**

I. Chapter IV of Title I of Book II of the Environmental Code is supplemented by a Section 5 worded as follows:

" Section 5: Obligations relating to structures

" Art. L. 214-17.- I. - After consulting the concerned general councils, the concerned territorial basin public establishments, the basin committees and, in Corsica, the Assembly of Corsica, the administrative authority establishes, for each basin or sub-basin:
" 1° A list of watercourses, parts of watercourses, or canals among those that are in very good ecological status or identified by the master plans for water development and management as playing the role of a biological reservoir necessary for maintaining or achieving the good ecological status of the watercourses of a watershed or in which full protection of migratory fish living alternately in fresh and salt water is necessary, on which no authorization or concession can be granted for the construction of new structures if they constitute an obstacle to ecological continuity.
" The renewal of the concession or authorization of existing structures, regularly installed on these watercourses, parts of watercourses, or canals, is subject to prescriptions allowing for the maintenance of the very good ecological status of the waters, the maintenance or achievement of the good ecological status of the watercourses of a watershed, or ensuring the protection of migratory fish living alternately in fresh and salt water;
" 2° A list of watercourses, parts of watercourses, or canals in which it is necessary to ensure the sufficient transport of sediments and the circulation of migratory fish. Any structure therein must be managed, maintained, and equipped according to rules defined by the administrative authority, in consultation with the owner or, failing that, the operator.
" II. - The lists referred to in 1° and 2° of I are established by order of the competent administrative authority, after studying the impact of the classifications on the various uses of water referred to in Article L. 211-1.
" III. - The obligations resulting from I apply from the date of publication of the lists. Those arising from 2° of I apply, after a period of five years following the publication of the lists, to existing regularly installed structures.
" The fifth paragraph of Article 2 of the Law of 16 October 1919 on the use of hydraulic energy and Article L. 432-6 of this code remain applicable until these obligations are substituted for them, within the period provided for in the preceding paragraph. Upon the expiration of the said period, and no later than 1 January 2014, the fifth paragraph of Article 2 of the aforementioned Law of 16 October 1919 is repealed and the aforementioned Article L. 432-6 is repealed.
" The obligations resulting from I of this article only give right to indemnity if they impose a special and exorbitant burden on the owner or operator of the structure.

" Art. L. 214-18. - I. - Any structure to be built in the bed of a watercourse must include devices maintaining in this bed a minimum flow guaranteeing permanently the life, circulation, and reproduction of the species living in the waters at the time of the installation of the structure, as well as, where applicable, devices preventing the penetration of fish into the intake and tailrace canals.
" This minimum flow must not be less than one-tenth of the average annual flow of the watercourse immediately downstream or at the structure's location, evaluated from available information covering a minimum period of five years, or the flow immediately upstream of the structure, if the latter is lower. For watercourses or parts of watercourses whose average annual flow is greater than 80 cubic meters per second, or for structures that contribute, through their modulation capacity, to the production of electricity during peak consumption periods and whose list is fixed by decree in the Council of State after the opinion of the Higher Council for Energy, this minimum flow must not be less than one-twentieth of the average annual flow of the watercourse immediately downstream or at the structure's location evaluated under the same conditions or the flow immediately upstream of the structure, if the latter is lower. However, for watercourses or sections of watercourses with an atypical functioning making the fixing of a minimum flow under the above conditions irrelevant, the minimum flow may be set at a lower value.
" II. - The authorization or concession acts may fix different minimum flow values according to the periods of the year, provided that the annual average of these values is not lower than the minimum flows fixed in application of I. In addition, the lowest flow must remain greater than half of the aforementioned minimum flows.
" When a watercourse or a section of a watercourse is subject to an exceptional natural low-water period, the administrative authority may fix, for this low-water period, temporary minimum flows lower than the minimum flows provided for in I.
" III. - The operator of the structure is required to ensure the operation and maintenance of the devices guaranteeing in the bed of the watercourse the minimum flows defined in the preceding paragraphs.
" IV. - For structures existing at the date of promulgation of Law No. 2006-1772 of 30 December 2006 on water and aquatic environments, the obligations it institutes are substituted, upon the renewal of their concession or authorization and at the latest on 1 January 2014, for the obligations previously imposed on them. This substitution does not give rise to indemnity except under the conditions provided for in III of Article L. 214-17.

" V. - This article is not applicable to the Rhine or to international parts of shared watercourses.
" Art. L. 214-19. - A decree in the Council of State specifies the conditions of application of this section. "

" Art. L. 215-14. - Without prejudice to Articles 556 and 557 of the Civil Code and Chapters I, II, IV, VI, and VII of this title, the riparian owner is required to regularly maintain the watercourse. Regular maintenance aims to maintain the watercourse in its equilibrium profile, to allow the natural flow of water, and to contribute to its good ecological status or, where applicable, its good ecological potential, notably by removing blockages, debris, and sediment accumulations, whether floating or not, by pruning or trimming bank vegetation. A decree in the Council of State determines the conditions of application of this article.

" Art. L. 215-15. - I. - Grouped regular maintenance operations of a watercourse, canal, or body of water and those required in mountainous areas for the securing of torrents are carried out within the framework of a management plan established at the scale of a coherent hydrographic unit and compatible with the objectives of the water development and management plan, where one exists. The authorization to execute this management plan under Articles L. 214-1 to L. 214-6 has a multi-year validity.
" When territorial authorities, their groupings, or mixed syndicates created pursuant to Article L. 5721-2 of the General Code of Territorial Authorities take charge of this grouped maintenance pursuant to Article L. 211-7 of this code, the public inquiry provided for the declaration of general interest is conducted jointly with that provided for in Article L. 214-4.

" Unless there is a contrary deliberation, the municipality, the public establishment for inter-municipal cooperation, or the mixed syndicate partially exercising these missions but not recovering the proceeds of the tax benefits from a partial rebate of this product from the municipality or the group that has recovered the tax. The distribution of this product is carried out in application of the modalities decided by concordant deliberations of the municipalities and groups participating in the missions of collection, transport, storage, and treatment of rainwater. In the absence of concordant deliberations, the ceiling within which the rate of the tax is defined is reduced by half.
" The tax is based on the surface area of the buildings connected to a public rainwater collection network.
" The municipality or the group that recovers the tax establishes its basis in view of the elements provided by the mayor of the municipality or the president of the group in charge of the collection of rainwater. This information relates in particular to the list of buildings connected to the network, their surface area, and the identity of the owner of the taxable buildings.

" The rate of the tax is fixed by deliberation of the deliberative assembly of the municipality or the competent group to establish the tax, within the limit of EUR 0.20 per square meter. The deliberations establishing and fixing the rate of the tax are adopted under the conditions provided for in Article 1639 A bis of the General Tax Code.

" Art. L. 2333-98. - The tax is due by the owners, on 1 January of the tax year, of the properties subject to the tax. In case of multiple owners, the tax is due by the co-ownership or the real estate co-ownership company or, failing that, each of the joint owners in proportion to the rights they hold. In case of dismemberment of the property right, the tax is due by the usufructuary. In case of land leased by emphyteutic lease, by construction lease, or by rehabilitation lease, the tax is established in the name of the emphyteuta or the lessee of the construction or rehabilitation lease.
" The tax does not constitute a recoverable tax by the owners within the meaning of Law No. 89-462 of 16 July 1989 tending to improve rental relations and amending Law No. 86-1290 of 23 December 1986.
" Owners who have implemented devices avoiding or limiting the discharge of rainwater into the network mentioned in Article L. 2333-97 benefit from a reduction, between 10% and 90% of the amount of the tax. The tax is no longer due when the implemented device allows for avoiding the discharge and leads to the effective suppression of the connection to the public rainwater collection network.
" The mayor or the president of the public establishment for inter-municipal cooperation or the mixed syndicate designates qualified persons responsible for checking the condition and functioning of these devices. The benefit of the reduction is subject to the possibility of accessing, for the aforementioned persons, private properties in order to proceed with the examination of the devices.

" Art. L. 2333-99. - The tax is assessed and recovered by the accountant of the municipality, of the public establishment for inter-municipal cooperation, or of the mixed syndicate as in matters of direct taxes and according to the same guarantees and sanctions. However, the tax is not recovered when the surface area of the subject properties is less than a minimum surface area at most equal to 600 square meters.
" The litigation relating to the tax is handled by the municipality or the group that has established it. Claims are presented, processed, and judged as in matters of direct taxes.

" The product of the tax is exclusively allocated to the creation, operation, renewal, extension of the collection, transport, storage, and treatment facilities for rainwater, to the maintenance of these structures, as well as to the control of the devices avoiding or limiting the discharge of this water into public structures. An appendix to the administrative account traces the revenues procured by this tax and their use.

" Art. L. 2333-100. - A decree in the Council of State specifies the modalities for implementing this section, particularly concerning the definition of rainwater collection networks, the modalities for controlling the connection and limitation devices for rainwater discharges from connected buildings, and the modalities for calculating the reductions to which these limitation devices give right.

" Art. L. 2333-101. - This section is applicable to the departments of Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, and Val-de-Marne, as well as to the interdepartmental institution they have created between them when, pursuant to Article L. 3451-1, they ensure all or part of the missions of collection, transport, storage, and treatment of rainwater.

" Art. L. 2224-12. - The municipalities and the groupings of territorial authorities, after the opinion of the consultative commission of local public services, establish, for each water or sanitation service for which they are responsible, a service regulation defining, according to local conditions, the services provided by the service as well as the respective obligations of the operator, the subscribers, the users, and the owners.
" The operator gives each subscriber the service regulation or sends it to them by post or email. The payment of the first invoice following the distribution of the service regulation or its update is considered as an acknowledgment of receipt by the subscriber. The regulation is kept at the disposal of the users.
" The operator reports to the mayor or the president of the group of territorial authorities on the modalities and effectiveness of the distribution of the service regulation.
" In case of use of another water resource by the subscriber, the service regulation provides for the possibility for the agents of the drinking water service to access private properties to proceed with the control of the interior drinking water distribution installations and the withdrawal structures, wells, and boreholes. The control costs are borne by the subscriber. In case of risk of contamination of the water from the public distribution network by water from another source, the service enjoins the subscriber to implement the necessary protection measures. In the absence of implementation of these measures, the service may proceed with the closure of the water connection. A decree in the Council of State sets the modalities of access to private properties and control of the installations provided for by this article.

" Users of drinking water services may at any time submit a request to terminate their subscription contract. This contract ends under the conditions fixed by the regulation of each service, within a period that cannot exceed fifteen days from the date of presentation of the request.

" Art. L. 2224-12-1. - Any supply of drinking water, regardless of the beneficiary, is subject to invoicing at the rate applicable to the corresponding category of users. The authorities mentioned in Article L. 2224-12 are required to put an end, before 1 January 2008, to any contrary provision or stipulation. This article is not applicable to water consumption from fire hydrants and posts placed on the public domain.

" Art. L. 2224-12-2. - Under conditions fixed by decree in the Council of State, the rules relating to drinking water and sanitation fees and to the sums provided for by Articles L. 1331-1 to L. 1331-10 of the Public Health Code are established by deliberation of the municipal council or the deliberative assembly of the group of territorial authorities.
" When the municipalities take charge of the works mentioned in the second sentence of the first paragraph of II and in the first sentence of the third paragraph of III of Article L. 2224-8, they are reimbursed in full by the owners for the costs of any nature incurred by these works, including management costs, less any subsidies obtained.
" The prohibition provided for in the first paragraph of Article L. 511-5 of the Monetary and Financial Code does not prevent the municipalities from staggering the reimbursements due by the owners by virtue of the preceding paragraph.
" These sums are collected for the benefit of the budget of the sanitation service and recovered like the fees due by the users of the sanitation service.

" Art. L. 2224-12-3. - The drinking water and sanitation fees cover the charges consecutive to investments, operation, and renewals necessary for the provision of services, as well as the charges and taxes of any nature related to their execution.
" For domestic subscribers, requests for a security deposit or the payment of a guarantee deposit are prohibited. The reimbursement of the sums collected as guarantee deposits occurs within a maximum period of three years from the promulgation of Law No. 2006-1772 of 30 December 2006 on water and aquatic environments.

" Art. L. 2224-12-4. - I. - Any water bill includes an amount calculated based on the volume actually consumed by the subscriber and may, in addition, include an amount calculated independently of this volume based on the fixed charges of the service and the characteristics of the connection, in particular the number of dwellings served.
" This amount may not exceed a ceiling, the calculation modalities of which are defined by order of the ministers in charge of the interior, the environment, and consumption, after the opinion of the National Water Committee and the National Consumption Council. The municipal council or the deliberative assembly of the group of territorial authorities modifies, if necessary, the pricing within a period of two years following the date of publication of this order. This paragraph is not applicable to tourist municipalities referred to in Article L. 133-11 of the Tourism Code.
" However, on an exceptional basis, when the water resource is abundant and a limited number of users are connected to the network, the State representative in the department may, under conditions provided for by decree in the Council of State, at the request of the mayor or the president of the competent group of territorial authorities to ensure water distribution, authorize a pricing not including a term proportional to the volume of water consumed.
" II. - When more than 30% of the water resource used for distribution is subject to water allocation rules pursuant to Article L. 211-2 of the Environmental Code, the municipal council or the deliberative assembly of the group of territorial authorities proceeds, within a period of two years from the date of classification as a water allocation zone, to a re-examination of the pricing modalities in order to encourage users to a better use of the resource.
" III. - From 1 January 2010 and subject to the second paragraph of I, the amount of the water bill calculated based on the volume actually consumed may be established either on the basis of a uniform rate per cubic meter or on the basis of a progressive tariff. This bill shows the price per liter of water.
" However, a degressive tariff may be established if more than 70% of the water withdrawal is not subject to water allocation rules pursuant to Article L. 211-2 of the Environmental Code.
" The municipal council or the deliberative assembly of the group of territorial authorities modifies, if necessary, the pricing within a period of two years from 1 January 2008 for the water allocation zones created on that date and, for the other zones, from the date of their classification as a water allocation zone.
" When the municipal council or the deliberative assembly of the group of territorial authorities defines a progressive or degressive tariff based on water consumption, it may define, for collective residential buildings, a specific scale taking into account the number of dwellings.
" IV. - In municipalities where the balance between the resource and water consumption is seasonally threatened, the municipal council or the deliberative assembly of the group of territorial authorities may define different tariffs according to the periods of the year.

" Art. L. 2224-12-5. - A decree sets the conditions under which users connected or connectable to the sanitation network are obliged to install a water metering device that they withdraw from sources other than the distribution network. It also sets the conditions under which the water consumption recorded by means of this device is taken into account in the calculation of the sanitation fee due by the users. "

**Article 84 of the Law of 30 December 2006**

In Section 3 of Chapter III of Title I of Book II of the Environmental Code, a sub-section 3 is created, worded as follows:

" Sub-section 3: Fees of the water agencies

" Paragraph 1: General provisions

" Art. L. 213-10. - In application of the prevention principle and the principle of reparation of damages to the environment, the water agency establishes and collects from public or private persons fees for water pollution, for modernization of collection networks, for diffuse pollution, for withdrawal from the water resource, for water storage during low-water periods, for obstacles on watercourses, and for protection of the aquatic environment.

" Paragraph 2: Fees for water pollution

" Art. L. 213-10-1. - The fees for water pollution constitute, on the one hand, a fee for water pollution of non-domestic origin and, on the other hand, a fee for water pollution of domestic origin.

" Art. L. 213-10-2. I. - Any person, with the exception of the owners and occupants of buildings for principal residential use as well as subscribers to the drinking water service whose activities involve uses of water comparable to uses for domestic purposes, whose activities cause the discharge of one of the pollution elements mentioned in IV into the natural environment directly or through a collection network, is subject to a fee for water pollution of non-domestic origin.
" II. - The basis of the fee is the annual pollution discharged into the natural environment equal to twelve times the average of the monthly average pollution and the highest monthly pollution discharged. It is composed of the elements mentioned in IV.
" It is determined directly from the results of the regular monitoring of all discharges, the monitoring device being approved and controlled by an organization mandated by the water agency. However, when the theoretical level of pollution related to the activity is below a threshold defined by decree or when the regular monitoring of discharges proves impossible, the basis is determined indirectly by the difference between, on the one hand, a theoretical level of pollution corresponding to the activity in question and, on the other hand, the level of pollution avoided by the depollution devices put in place by the taxpayer or the manager of the collective network.
" The theoretical level of pollution of an activity is calculated on the basis of quantities and coefficients characteristic of this activity determined from general measurement campaigns or studies based on representative samples.
" The avoided pollution is determined from measurements carried out each year, the monitoring device being approved by the water agency or, failing that, from coefficients evaluating the effectiveness of the depollution device implemented. When the pollution produced comes from a direct spreading, it is calculated indirectly by taking into account the quality of the methods of recovery of effluents and spreading.
" III. - At the request of the taxpayer, the regular monitoring of the discharges referred to in II has for object to measure the annual pollution added by the activity.
" IV. - For each constituent element of the pollution, the maximum rate of the fee and the threshold below which the fee is not due are fixed as follows:
(Table translated below)
" The fee of a person with livestock activities is based on the number of their large livestock units and on a stocking rate greater than 1.4 large livestock units per hectare of utilized agricultural area. The rate of the fee is 3 per unit. The perception threshold of the fee is fixed at 90 units and at 150 units in the zones referred to in Articles 3 and 4 of Law No. 85-30 of 9 January 1985 on the development and protection of the mountains and, for monogastric livestock, the conversion of animal numbers into large livestock units is carried out taking into account good feeding practices reducing the discharges of nitrogen compounds. The fee is collected from the forty-first large livestock unit held. Its amount is multiplied by three for livestock farms fined under the regulations relating to the protection of water quality.
" For each element of the basis, with the exception of livestock activities, the rate of the fee is fixed by a coherent geographical unit defined by taking into account:
" 1° The state of the water bodies;
" 2° The risks of infiltration or runoff of pollutants into groundwater bodies;
" 3° The prescriptions imposed under the water police or relating to water under another police;
" 4° The objectives fixed by the master plan for water development and management and the water development and management plan.

" Art. L. 213-10-3. I. - The following are subject to the fee for pollution of domestic origin:
" 1° Persons subscribing to the drinking water service, with the exception of those paying the fee referred to in I of Article L. 213-10-2;
" 2° The persons referred to in the same I whose activities result in discharges of pollution elements below the thresholds referred to in IV of the same article;
" 3° The users referred to in Article L. 2224-12-5 of the General Code of Territorial Authorities;
" 4° Persons having a borehole for their water supply, who install a device for metering the withdrawn water.
" II. - The basis of the fee is the volume of water billed to the subscriber. For the persons referred to in 2° of I of this article, the basis of the fee is capped at 6,000 cubic meters. For the persons referred to in 3° and 4° of the same I, this basis also includes the volume of water withdrawn from sources other than the distribution network. The volume of water used for livestock farming is excluded from this basis if it is subject to specific metering.
" When the water pricing does not include a term proportional to the volume of water consumed, and in the absence of metering of the distributed water, the basis of the fee is calculated on the basis of a flat rate per inhabitant determined by decree.
" III. - The water agency sets, within the limit of EUR 0.5 per cubic meter, a rate per coherent geographical unit defined by taking into account:
" 1° The state of the water bodies;
" 2° The risks of infiltration or runoff of pollutants into the groundwater bodies;
" 3° The prescriptions imposed under the water police or relating to water under another police;
" 4° The objectives set by the master plan for water development and management and the water development and management plan.
" IV. - The fee is collected from the operator of the drinking water service by the water agency. It is due upon collection of the price of the distributed water. The operator bills the fee to the persons subscribing to the drinking water service defined in I under administrative and financial conditions fixed by decree.
" V. - When a device helps prevent the deterioration of water quality, a premium is paid to the public or private project owner of this device or to their representative. It is calculated based on the quantity of pollution of domestic origin whose contribution to the natural environment is suppressed or avoided. The premium may be modulated to take into account compliance with the prescriptions imposed under a water police.
" Similarly, a premium is paid to the municipalities or their groupings for their competencies in the control or maintenance of non-collective sanitation facilities. The amount of this premium is at most equal to 80% of the amount of the fees for domestic pollution paid by subscribers not connected to a collective sanitation network, based on the results of the control and the activity of the service in charge.

" 3° Withdrawals linked to aquaculture;
" 4° Withdrawals linked to geothermal energy;
" 5° Withdrawals made outside the low-water period, for works intended for the replenishment of natural environments;
" 6° Withdrawals related to the anti-frost fight for perennial crops.
" III. - The fee is based on the volume of water withdrawn during a year.
" When a person has a borehole for their water supply, they are required to install a device for metering the withdrawn water. The basis of the fee is then increased by the volume of water thus withdrawn.
" When the person liable does not proceed with the measurement of their withdrawals, the fee is based on a flat-rate volume calculated taking into account the proven or unproven impossibility of the measurement and the characteristic quantities of the activity in question determined from general measurement campaigns or studies based on representative samples.
" IV. - The water agency sets the amounts of withdrawn volume below which the fee is not due. These amounts cannot be higher than 10,000 cubic meters per year for withdrawals in category 1 resources and 7,000 cubic meters per year for withdrawals in category 2 resources.
" V. - For the fixing of the fee rate, the water resources of each basin are classified in category 1 when they are located outside the water allocation zones defined in application of 2° of II of Article L. 211-2 or in category 2 otherwise.
" The rate of the fee is fixed by the water agency in cents of euro per cubic meter within the limit of the following ceilings, according to the different uses for which the withdrawals are made:

USES	CATEGORY 1	CATEGORY 2
Irrigation (except gravity irrigation)	2.3	2.3
Gravity irrigation	0.10	0.15
Drinking water supply	6	8
Industrial cooling leading to a restitution greater than 99%	0.35	0.5
Canal supply	0.015	0.03
Other economic uses	3	4

" The water agency fixes, within the limits of the above ceilings, a rate per coherent geographical unit defined by taking into account the objectives fixed by the master plan for water development and management and the water development and management plan if it exists, especially when they require the implementation of a specific intervention program and financial assistance, as well as hydrological conditions.
" For all withdrawals intended for irrigation carried out in hillside reservoirs, and whatever their geographical location, the applicable fee rate is that of the category 1 resource.
" For a category 2 resource, when the withdrawal for irrigation is carried out collectively by an organization defined in 6° of II of Article L. 211-3, the fee rate is the rate applicable for a category 1 resource.
" The basis of withdrawals for gravity irrigation is fixed on a flat-rate basis at 10,000 cubic meters of water per irrigated hectare.
" VI. - Specific modalities for calculating the fee are applicable in the following cases:
" 1° When the withdrawal is intended for several uses, the fee is calculated pro rata to the volumes used for each use;
" 2° When the withdrawal is intended for the supply of a canal, the fee is based on the volume of water of this withdrawal, after deduction of the volumes withdrawn in the canal and subject to this fee.
" The volumes withdrawn to supply a canal for the preservation of aquatic ecosystems or sites and wetlands are deducted from the basis of the fee;
" 3° When the withdrawal is intended for the operation of a hydroelectric installation, the fee is based on the product of the volume of water turbined in the year expressed in cubic meters by the total gross head of the installation as it appears in its administrative title, expressed in meters.
" The rate of the fee is fixed by the water agency within the limit of a ceiling of EUR 0.6 per million cubic meters and per meter of head according to the state of the water bodies and the objectives fixed by the master plan for water development and management and the water development and management plan if it exists.
" This rate is multiplied by 1.5 when the installation does not operate at the run-of-the-river.
" The fee is not due when the volume of water turbined in the year is less than one million cubic meters.
" VII. - A decree in the Council of State shall specify the application modalities of this article.

" Paragraph 6: Fee for water storage in a low-water period

" Art. L. 213-10-10. - I. - A fee for water storage in a low-water period is due by any person who has a storage installation of more than one million cubic meters and who proceeds to the storage of all or part of the volume flowing in a watercourse during a low-water period.
" II. - The basis of the fee is the volume of water stored during the low-water period. This volume is equal to the difference between the volume stored at the end of the period and the volume stored at the beginning of the period. The volumes stored during floods greater than the quinquennial frequency flood and destocked within a period of thirty days from the date on which the flood reaches its maximum are not taken into account for the calculation of the basis of the fee.
" The water agency fixes, in each basin, the low-water period according to the regime of the watercourses.
" III. - The rate of the fee is fixed by the agency within the limit of a ceiling of 0.01 per cubic meter.

" Art. L. 213-10-11. - I. - A fee for an obstacle on a watercourse is due by any person possessing a structure constituting a continuous obstacle joining the two banks of a watercourse.
" The owners of structures forming part of hydroelectric installations subject to the fee for withdrawals from the water resource are exempt from the fee for an obstacle on a watercourse.
" II. - The fee is based on the product, expressed in meters, of the difference in water level between the upstream water line and the downstream water line by the flow coefficient of the section of watercourse at the location of the structure and by an obstruction coefficient.
" The flow coefficient varies according to the average interannual flow of the considered section of watercourse. It is between 0.3 for sections whose average interannual flow is less than 0.3 cubic meters per second and 40 for sections whose average interannual flow is greater than or equal to 1,000 cubic meters per second.
" The obstruction coefficient varies between 0.3 and 1 according to the importance of the obstruction caused by the obstacle to sediment transport and to the circulation of fish in accordance with the following table:

OBSTRUCTION COEFFICIENT	STRUCTURES allowing sediment transit	STRUCTURES not allowing sediment transit
Structure passable by fish in both directions.	0.3	0.6
Structure passable by fish in one direction only.	0.4	0.8
Structure not passable by fish.	0.5	1

" III. - The fee is not due when the difference in level is less than 5 meters and for watercourses whose average flow is less than 0.3 cubic meters per second.
" IV. - The rate of the fee is fixed by the water agency within the limit of EUR 150 per meter per coherent geographical unit defined by taking into account the impact of the structures located there on sediment transport and on the free circulation of fish.
" V. - A decree in the Council of State shall specify the application modalities of this article.

" Paragraph 8: Fee for the protection of the aquatic environment

" Art. L. 213-10-12. - I. - A fee for the protection of the aquatic environment is due by the persons mentioned in II.

" The water agency transmits the control report to the taxpayer. The latter may communicate their observations to the agency within thirty days. The taxpayer is informed by the water agency of the follow-up to the control.
" Two successive controls relating to the basis of the same fee for the same years cannot be carried out.
" The on-site control is carried out by agents authorized by the director of the agency. The agency may entrust to organizations authorized by the administrative authority under conditions provided for by the decree in the Council of State mentioned in Article L. 213-11-16 and mandated for this purpose by its director the task of carrying out certain technical controls.

" Art. L. 213-11-2. - The administrations of the State and the territorial authorities, the concessionary enterprises of a public person, and the organizations of any nature subject to the control of the administrative authority must communicate to the agency, at its request, the documents they hold which are necessary for the basis and control of the fees mentioned in Articles L. 213-10 to L. 213-10-12 without being able to oppose professional secrecy.

" Art. L. 213-11-3. - When the agency finds an insufficiency, an inaccuracy, an omission, or a concealment in the elements serving as a basis for the calculation of the fees, it shall send the taxpayer a reasoned proposal for rectification so as to allow them to formulate their observations or to make known their acceptance within a period of thirty days.

" 2° Those who have abstained from responding within the time limits fixed to the requests for information or clarifications provided for in Article L. 213-11-1;
" 3° Those who have refused to submit to the controls or who have obstructed their conduct.
" II. - In case of ex officio assessment, the elements serving as a basis for the calculation of the fees are brought to the attention of the taxpayer at least thirty days before the collection by means of a notification specifying the modalities for determining the elements and the amount of the fees due, as well as the faculty for the taxpayer to present their observations.

" Art. L. 213-11-7. - In case of failure to declare, late declaration of the elements necessary for the determination of the fees, when the declaration reveals insufficient, inaccurate, or incomplete elements, or in case of ex officio taxation in application of 2° and 3° of I of Article L. 213-11-6, the fees charged to the taxpayer are subject to late payment interest and, where applicable, to surcharges according to the modalities provided for in matters of income tax by the General Tax Code in its version in force on January 1 of the year for which the fees are due.

" Art. L. 213-11-8. - A collection order issued by the director of the agency and taken over by the accounting officer is notified to the taxpayer for the recovery of the fees as well as late payment interest and surcharges with which they are, where applicable, associated.

" The recovery by the accountant of the agency may be ensured by way of opposition to a third-party holder addressed to persons who hold funds on behalf of the taxpayer, who have a debt to them, or who pay them a remuneration.
" The accountant notifies this opposition to the taxpayer at the same time as it is addressed to the third-party holder.
" The opposition to a third-party holder entails the effect of immediate attribution, provided for in Article 43 of Law No. 91-650 of 9 July 1991 on the reform of civil execution procedures, of the seized sums available for the benefit of the agency up to the amount for which the opposition is practiced. Under penalty of being claimed the seized sums increased by the legal interest rate, the third-party holder must pay the funds to the accountant in charge of the recovery within thirty days following the receipt of the opposition.
" The opposition to a third-party holder may be exercised on conditional or term claims; in this case, the funds are paid to the accountant in charge of the recovery when these claims become due.
" When the same person is simultaneously the recipient of several oppositions to a third-party holder established in the name of the same taxpayer, they must, in case of insufficiency of funds, execute these oppositions in proportion to their respective amounts.
" If the funds held or due by the third-party holder are unavailable, the latter must notify the accountant in charge of the recovery upon receipt of the opposition.
