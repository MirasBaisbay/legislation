Water Act
Consulted on 08-06-2023. Valid from 01-07-2021 to present

Act of 29 January 2009, containing rules with respect to the management and use of water systems (Water Act)

We Beatrix, by the grace of God, Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, etc. etc. etc.

To all who shall see this or hear it read, greetings! We make it known:

Whereas We have considered that the government, in its duty to ensure the habitability of the country and the protection and improvement of the environment, where that duty takes shape in water management, is faced with major tasks, and that with a view to an effective and efficient approach to water management, it is desirable to streamline and modernise the statutory instruments and in so doing to place the integrated management of water systems at the centre;

So is it that We, having heard the Council of State, and in common concert with the States General, have approved and decreed, as We approve and decree by these presents:

2. The application of this Act is also aimed at objectives other than those mentioned in the first paragraph, insofar as provided for elsewhere in this Act.

**§ 2. Flood defence standards**

**Article 2.2**
1. In Appendix II to this Act, a alert value is established for each dike section, with the exception of dike section 16-5, mentioned in Appendix I. The alert value is:
    a. for a dike section, not being a dike section as referred to in subsection b, the probability of flooding per year, the exceeding of which is reported to Our Minister pursuant to Article 2.12, fifth paragraph;
    b. for dike sections 201, 204a, 204b, 206, 208 up to and including 212, 214 up to and including 219, and 222 up to and including 225, mentioned in Appendix I, the probability of failure per year, the exceeding of which is reported to Our Minister pursuant to Article 2.12, fifth paragraph.
2. In Appendix III to this Act, a lower limit is established for each dike section. The lower limit is:
    a. for a dike section as referred to in the first paragraph, second sentence, subsection a, the probability of flooding per year against which the dike section must at least be designed;
    b. for a dike section, mentioned in the first paragraph, second sentence, subsection b, the probability of failure per year against which the dike section must at least be designed;
    c. for dike section 16-5, mentioned in Appendix I, if it experiences a hydraulic load due to the flooding of the area protected by a dike section in front of it, the probability of flooding against which the dike section must then at least be designed.
3. Without prejudice to the second paragraph, Appendix III states:
    a. for a dike section that may experience an increase in hydraulic load as a result of a measure aimed at increasing the discharge or storage capacity of a water system, the probability of flooding against which the dike section must at least be designed if such an increase occurs;
    b. for dike sections 208 up to and including 210 and 225, the probability of non-closure that the storm surge barrier must at least meet if it has to be closed.

**Article 2.3**
1. For the purpose of assessing the safety of a dike section, rules shall be established by ministerial regulation for determining the hydraulic load and strength.
2. The ministerial regulation referred to in the first paragraph shall be established for a maximum of twelve years at a time. In the preparation of the regulation, the boards of the water boards shall be consulted.

**Article 2.4**
1. By order in council, after consulting the provincial executive, or by provincial ordinance, a safety standard shall be established for other than primary flood defences managed by the State, or by another administrator, respectively, to be designated therein.
2. Notwithstanding the first paragraph, the safety standard for flood defences other than primary ones that were designated as primary flood defences pursuant to Article 1.3, first paragraph, as it read on 31 December 2016, shall be established before 1 January 2019. Until that standard is established, the defences in question must provide at least the same level of safety as was the case on 1 January 2017.

**Article 2.5**
By ministerial regulation, after consulting the provincial executive, or by or pursuant to provincial ordinance, it shall be established for other than primary flood defences managed by the State, or by another administrator, respectively, to be designated therein, for locations to be specified therein, which relationship between water levels and their exceedance probabilities is the starting point for determining their flood-retaining capacity. In that establishment, values of other such factors may also be established.

**Article 2.6**
Our Minister shall ensure the creation and availability of technical guidelines for the design, management and maintenance of primary flood defences. These guidelines shall serve as recommendations to the administrators.

**Article 2.7**
1. Landward displacement of the coastline shall be prevented or countered by the State, insofar as Our Minister deems this necessary on account of the standards for dike sections to be maintained pursuant to this Act.
2. The coastline referred to in the first paragraph shall be indicated on a map made available free of charge by Our Minister, which shall be revised every six years. Notification of its availability shall be made in the Government Gazette.

**§ 3. Standards for water quantity, water quality and function fulfilment**

Nevertheless, an owner of the immovable property may, if due to the nature or extent of the damage the ownership of that property has become of too little significance to him, demand that the permit holder takes over the ownership of the immovable property. The claim may be made both in the event of non-acceptance of a sum offered as compensation for damage and after acceptance thereof.
4. Claims on the basis of this article shall be heard by the court within whose jurisdiction the immovable property or the major part thereof is situated.

**Article 7.19**
1. A person who, on the basis of Article 7.18, first, second or third paragraph, can make a claim with respect to damage in connection with a water permit for the abstraction of groundwater or the infiltration of water as referred to in Article 6.4 or 6.5, subsection b, or pursuant to an ordinance of a water board, may first request the provincial executive of the province in which the immovable property referred to in Article 7.18 is wholly or largely situated to institute an investigation.
2. If an immovable property is located in an area where the groundwater level is influenced by more than one abstraction and it appears from the investigation that it cannot be determined, or not within a reasonable period, by which abstraction the damage suffered by the immovable property is caused, the provincial executive shall, at the request of the person with rights to that immovable property, grant him compensation for the costs of preventing the damage or compensation for damage. The person with rights is in that case obliged to transfer the rights which he might be able to assert against third parties.

**Article 7.20**
1. If the court finds the claim referred to in Article 7.18, third paragraph, to be well-founded, it shall order the permit holder to take over and to pay the takeover sum. No other legal remedy is available against the judgment than an appeal in cassation. The appeal in cassation must, on penalty of inadmissibility, be registered in the registers referred to in Article 433 of the Code of Civil Procedure within eight days of its being lodged.
2. Articles 27, first and second paragraphs, 28, first, second and third paragraphs, 29 to 35 and 37, first paragraph, of the Expropriation Act shall apply mutatis mutandis to the determination of the takeover sum, on the understanding that the court may also appoint two experts instead of one or an odd number of experts.
3. The judgment by which the permit holder has been ordered to take over can be registered in the public registers, referred to in Section 2 of Title 1 of Book 3 of the Civil Code, after it has become final and conclusive. By registration of the judgment, ownership passes to the permit holder.

**§ 4. Damage to water management works**

**Article 7.21**
1. The costs of damage caused to water management works managed or maintained by an administrator, for which owners or users of vessels are legally liable, shall be estimated by the official designated for that purpose by the administrator and stated in a report, a copy of which shall if possible be given to the skipper.
2. If the estimated amount is not paid to the official concerned as security or if security is not provided to his satisfaction for payment thereof within a reasonable period, this official is authorised, if necessary with the use of force, to prevent the continuation of the voyage, the undertaking of the return journey or the commencement of a new voyage, even if the vessel has in the meantime been brought outside his official area.
3. Without prejudice to the right to compensation for the damage, the public-law body concerned is authorised to use the amount paid for the repair of the damage. If it appears that the actual costs of damage are less than the amount paid, the surplus, with the statutory interest thereon from the day of payment, shall be paid to the person who paid.
4. This article does not apply to the costs of locating, marking and clearing a wreck within the meaning of the Maritime Accidents (Response) Act.

**Article 7.22**
1. The State may – subject to mitigation by the court – recover the costs borne by the State of investigating contamination or degradation of the bed or bank of a surface water body and of measures as referred to in Article 4.6, second paragraph, under a, or Article 5.15, first paragraph, in connection with contamination or degradation of the bed or bank of a surface water body that constitutes an obstacle to achieving the desired area quality, from the person whose unlawful act caused that contamination or degradation in the case in question and who is therefore or otherwise liable under civil law to any public authority for the consequences thereof, other than by agreement.
2. If the costs referred to in the first paragraph are also borne by a water board, the State may also recover these costs in accordance with that paragraph.
3. The State may recover costs borne by the State as referred to in the first paragraph in accordance with the rules on unjust enrichment from the person who is unjustly enriched by that investigation or those measures. The second paragraph shall apply mutatis mutandis.
4. The powers referred to in the first and third paragraphs shall accrue to the water board in cases in which costs as referred to in the first paragraph are borne entirely by it, as well as in cases in which the State does not make use of this power, insofar as such costs are borne by it.
5. Article 75, fifth paragraph, of the Soil Protection Act shall apply mutatis mutandis.
