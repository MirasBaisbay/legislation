**MONITORING OF SURFACE WATERS AND MONITORING OF GROUNDWATER. LOCAL MONITORING. ACCOUNTING FOR EXTRACTED GROUNDWATER, WITHDRAWN SURFACE WATER, AND WASTEWATER DISCHARGED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. STATE WATER CADASTRE. CONTROL OVER THE USE AND PROTECTION OF WATERS**

**Article 55. Monitoring of surface waters and monitoring of groundwater**

1.  Monitoring of surface waters and monitoring of groundwater constitute a system of regular observations of the state of surface and groundwater, respectively, based on hydrological, hydromorphological, hydrochemical, hydrobiological, and other indicators, and the assessment and forecast of its changes.
2.  Monitoring of surface waters and monitoring of groundwater are types of environmental monitoring and are conducted as part of the National Environmental Monitoring System in the Republic of Belarus in accordance with the legislation on environmental protection.
3.  Observations for the purposes of monitoring surface waters and monitoring of groundwater are carried out at observation points of the state network of observations of the state of surface and groundwater.
4.  The procedure for conducting monitoring of surface waters and monitoring of groundwater and the use of their data is established by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus.
5.  The protection of observation points of the state network of observations of the state of groundwater is carried out by the land users within the boundaries of the land plots on which such observation points are located. In cases where the observation points of the state network of observations of the state of groundwater are located within the boundaries of land plots classified as public lands or reserve lands, the protection of such observation points is ensured by the local executive and administrative body.

**Article 56. Local monitoring**

1.  Local monitoring, the object of observation of which is wastewater and surface waters, and local monitoring, the object of observation of which is groundwater, are types of environmental monitoring and are conducted as part of the National Environmental Monitoring System in the Republic of Belarus.
2.  The list of objects, parameters, and frequency of observations during the conduct of the types of local monitoring provided for in paragraph 1 of this article, as well as the list of legal entities and individual entrepreneurs conducting such types of local monitoring, are determined by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection.
3.  Legal entities and individual entrepreneurs who discharge wastewater directly into surface water bodies or through the sewerage system of populated areas, with the exception of cases provided for by legislative acts, are obliged to conduct local monitoring, the object of observation of which is wastewater and surface waters:
    3.1. at the points of wastewater discharge into the surface water body or the sewerage system;
    3.2. at background cross-sections located upstream from the wastewater discharge points;
    3.3. at control cross-sections located downstream from the wastewater discharge points.
    The location of control and background cross-sections is determined in accordance with the technical normative legal acts approved and enacted by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, which are mandatory for compliance.
4.  Legal entities and individual entrepreneurs who operate objects that have a harmful effect on groundwater, with the exception of cases provided for by legislative acts, are obliged to conduct local monitoring, the object of observation of which is groundwater, at the locations of identified or potential sources of their pollution, at observation points, including observation wells and (or) pits.

**Article 57. Accounting for extracted groundwater, withdrawn surface water, and wastewater discharged into the environment**

1.  Legal entities and individual entrepreneurs engaged in economic and other activities are obliged to keep records of extracted groundwater, withdrawn surface water, and wastewater discharged into the environment.

The accounting of extracted groundwater, withdrawn surface water, and wastewater discharged into the environment is kept by legal entities and individual entrepreneurs with the use of water flow (volume) measuring instruments that have undergone metrological assessment in the manner established by the legislation on ensuring the uniformity of measurements, with the exception of the cases specified in paragraph 3 of this article.
    The measurement of the volumes of wastewater discharged into the environment is carried out at each treatment facility at a location determined by the project documentation. In the event that it is impossible to install (operate) water flow (volume) measuring instruments at the treatment facilities, their installation on pipelines transporting wastewater for treatment is permitted, provided that the total volume of wastewater entering the treatment is accounted for.
3.  The installation of water flow (volume) measuring instruments is not required, and the accounting of extracted groundwater, withdrawn surface water, and wastewater discharged into the environment by non-instrumental (calculation) methods is permitted in the case of:
    3.1. discharge of surface wastewater;
    3.2. discharge of wastewater into the environment in a volume of 5 or less cubic meters per day. In this case, the volume of discharged wastewater is taken as equal to the volume of extracted (withdrawn) water according to the readings of the water flow (volume) measuring instruments installed at the water intake structures, with a coefficient of 0.7;
    3.3. extraction (withdrawal) of water from water bodies and the discharge of wastewater into them during fish farming;
    3.4. extraction (withdrawal) of water that is incidentally formed during the extraction of mineral resources;
    3.5. when the accounting of extracted groundwater, withdrawn surface water, and wastewater discharged into the environment is impossible with the use of water flow (volume) measuring instruments that have undergone metrological assessment in the manner established by the legislation on ensuring the uniformity of measurements.
4.  The accounting of extracted groundwater, withdrawn surface water, and wastewater discharged into the environment by non-instrumental (calculation) methods is based on the value of:
    4.1. electricity consumption for water pumping, operating time, and pump productivity. Pump productivity is determined by the data of their manufacturers' technical documentation;
    4.2. technological standards for water use;
    4.3. irrigated area and irrigation norms established in accordance with technical normative legal acts mandatory for compliance or project documentation for irrigation systems.
