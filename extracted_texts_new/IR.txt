The Law of Water and the Manner of its Nationalization

Chapter One – General Provisions

Section One – Public and National Ownership of Water

Article 1 – All waters running in rivers, natural streams, valleys, brooks, and any other natural course, whether surface or subterranean, as well as floodwaters, wastewaters, drainage waters, lakes, marshes, natural ponds, springs, mineral waters, and underground water resources are considered national wealth and belong to the public. The responsibility for the protection and utilization of this national wealth and for the construction and management of water resource development facilities is vested in the Ministry of Water and Power.

Article 2 – The beds of natural streams and rivers, whether they have perennial or seasonal flow, belong to the state. Their width is to the extent that delineates the course of the river or stream at its maximum ordinary flood level. The same applies to the shores of seas and lakes in accordance with the Law on Coastal Lands, enacted on 1346/05/25 (August 16, 1967). The construction of any type of structure in the beds of streams and rivers and on the shores of seas and lakes, whether natural or man-made reservoirs, with due regard to the legal buffer zone, is prohibited, except with the permission of the Ministry of Water and Power.

Addendum 1 – The maximum flood level for each river and natural stream shall be determined by the Ministry of Water and Power based on the river and stream's hydrological statistics and the high-water marks in their natural beds, without considering the effect of water facility constructions.

Addendum 2 – Should the Ministry of Water and Power deem existing structures in the beds of streams and rivers to be an obstruction to water and power utilization, it will notify the owner or possessor to clear and remove the structures within a specified period. In case of non-compliance, the Ministry of Water and Power, under the supervision of the public prosecutor or his representative, will proceed with the clearance and removal. If the structures were built with the permission of competent authorities before the enactment of this law, only compensation for the structures shall be determined and paid in the manner prescribed in Article 50.
