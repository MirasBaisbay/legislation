THE CONGRESS OF THE PARAGUAYAN NATION ENACTS AS LAW:

**CHAPTER I**
**OBJECTIVE**

**Article 1.**- The purpose of this Law is to regulate the sustainable and integrated management of all waters and the territories that produce them, regardless of their location, physical state, or natural occurrence within Paraguayan territory, in order to make them socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable for the people who inhabit the territory of the Republic of Paraguay.

**CHAPTER II**
**PRINCIPLES**

**Article 2.**- All legal-administrative relations and planning concerning water management and related activities shall be interpreted and, where necessary, integrated based on the National Water Resources Policy and the National Environmental Policy.

**Article 3.**- The integrated and sustainable management of the water resources of Paraguay shall be governed by the following Principles:
a) All waters, surface and groundwater, are the public property of the State, and its domain is inalienable and imprescriptible.
b) Access to water to satisfy basic needs is a human right and must be guaranteed by the State in adequate quantity and quality.
c) Water resources have multiple uses and functions, and this characteristic shall be adequately addressed, respecting the hydrological cycle and always prioritizing use for human consumption in the first instance.
d) The river basin is the basic management unit for water resources.
e) Water is a natural good that is a condition for the survival of every living being and the ecosystems that host them.
f) Water resources are a finite and vulnerable good.
g) Water resources possess social, environmental, and economic value.
h) The management of water resources must occur within the framework of sustainable development and must be decentralized, participatory, and with a gender perspective.
i) The Paraguayan State has the non-transferable and non-delegable function of ownership and stewardship of national water resources.

**Article 4.**- The National Water Resources Policy shall be dedicated to the following basic objectives:
a) To promote the sustainable, rational, and integrated use of water resources as a conditioning element for the survival of the human species and the entire ecological system, promoting with a strong sense of protection their best enjoyment, as well as that of other natural resources and the environment. To this end, consideration must be given to the unity of the resource at any stage of the hydrological cycle, the interdependence between different natural resources and between different water uses, the conditioning of the environment, and the protection, conservation, and restoration of water-producing territories by controlling and managing the influences that human action is capable of producing.
b) To guarantee access to drinking water for all inhabitants, given that it is a human right.
c) To promote and maintain adequate comprehensive knowledge of water resources in terms of quantity, quality, and opportunity for their use, as well as their conditioning nature on human activities, fostering systematic, operational, and technological scientific research, through or in collaboration with competent bodies.
d) To implement the use of water resources through the river basin management unit, as an element of territorial integration of the Republic and of the imposition of a just orientation of social, economic, cultural, and demographic development in accordance with the respective general policies, coordinating the activity of the different sectors, seeking a degree of harmonious balance between private interests and the public interest.
e) To develop a system for planning the knowledge and use of water resources and to promote its coordination with the general planning of the country.
f) To promote the rational use of water resources in accordance with a proper hierarchical ordering of the values and the essential, socioeconomic, and individual uses to be satisfied. For this purpose, it is convenient to establish vital priorities and the criteria to be applied to define an objective order for prioritizing other uses, according to the circumstances that determine the selection of the respective demands, evaluated by regional characteristics and within the complex of policies contained in this Law and general policy.
g) To foster the multiple use of water resources and the functionally coordinated integration among all of them through rational handling and common administration of all water manifestations, assigning priority value to multiple-use projects over single-use ones, provided that this is technically, socially, and economically justified and that they minimize effects or damage to the environment.
h) To aim for economy in the use of water resources through their rational and efficient utilization, thus making them available for other uses, and preventing their waste, pollution, and degradation.
i) To require the comprehensive preservation of water resources, acting fundamentally on the causes of pollution or degradation and, consequently, on their effects, with a systemic approach in river basins, aquifer recharge areas, and wetlands.
j) To manage water-producing territories in an environmentally and culturally appropriate manner, through authorities composed in each case of local governments, representatives of local communities, and technical experts, with powers of investigation, planning, coordination, and extrajudicial conflict resolution, which ensure the sustainability of water.
k) To promote within society the knowledge of methods and technologies necessary for the proper management, use, and conservation of water resources, given that they, more than any other natural resource, are intended for the use of all.
l) To coordinate, promote, and define the actions of public bodies, including decentralized ones, and private entities whose object is the defense of properties and the environment against the effects of climate change on waters, especially floods and salinization.
m) To provide for the comprehensive review of existing legislation and regulations and to keep them permanently updated, in order to harmonize them with international treaties and conventions ratified by our country, to adapt their understanding, improve their scope, and simplify their application, fundamentally with regard to the knowledge and use of water resources through the application of appropriate science, techniques, and technology, to promote and drive the proper development of the sector.
n) To provide for the execution and permanent updating of an inventory of available and potential water resources and the organization of an information bank that has an agile method for storing, processing, and consulting data; to this end, a convenient degree of coordination and reciprocal complementarity must be established among the different national bodies that, as the case and opportunity may be, have competence or involvement in the matter.
o) To gradually promote the development and operation of the governance and administration of water resources through river basin management units, within the concept and framework of the higher hierarchical-functional unit that exercises political and executive authority in an organic and coordinated manner with other equally involved sectors; within such a unit, to promote the development of the national water authority and planning system, coordinating them at the different local, municipal, regional, and national levels and with neighboring countries, contemplating compliance with all obligations that the Paraguayan State has assumed with the International Community through the treaties and conventions it has ratified or to which it has adhered.
p) To gradually but actively foster and develop the participation of users, through the communities' own organizations or those that are created and recognized as such within the framework of this Law, both in the programming of water resources development and in the administration and control of their uses.
