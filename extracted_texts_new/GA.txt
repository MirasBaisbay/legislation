Article 120: In matters of infringements or other breaches falling within the environmental domain, the obligation of remediation prevails. To this end, the payment of a fine or any other form of penalty made by the author does not extinguish the obligation concerned.

Chapter I: Scope of Application

Article 121: The following constitute damage caused to the Environment and to Sustainable Development: direct or indirect deteriorations of the environment, natural resources, and sustainable development which:

create a risk of serious harm to human health as a result of soil contamination resulting from the direct or indirect introduction, on the surface or in the soil, of substances, preparations, organisms, or micro-organisms;

seriously affect the chemical or quantitative ecological status or the ecological potential of waters, particularly the functions provided by the soils and waters for the benefit of one of these natural resources or for the benefit of the public;

seriously affect the maintenance or restoration to a favorable conservation status of soils, waters, as well as natural species and habitats such as breeding sites or resting areas for species;

seriously affect the state of the air and the atmosphere.

Article 122: An imminent threat of damage caused to the environment constitutes a probability that such damage will occur in the near future.

Article 123: The provisions of this title do not apply:

1- when the damage to the Environment or the imminent threat of such damage:

is caused by an armed conflict, a civil war, or an insurrection;

results from activities carried out in the interest of national defense or regional or international security;

is caused by a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable, and irresistible nature;

results from activities whose sole purpose is protection against major natural risks or natural disasters;

Article 124: The following are prevented or repaired according to the modalities defined by this law:

damage caused to the Environment and to Sustainable Development by professional activities, even in the absence of fault or negligence on the part of the exploiter;

Section 2: Preventive Measures

Article 126: In the event of an imminent threat of damage, the exploiter or the operator shall take, without delay and at his own expense, preventive measures to prevent its occurrence or to limit its effects.

If the threat persists, he shall inform the administration in charge of the Environment without delay of its nature and of the preventive measures he has taken and their results.

Article 127: In the event of damage, the exploiter or the operator shall inform the administration in charge of the Environment without delay. He shall take, without delay and at his own expense, measures aimed at putting an end to it, preventing or limiting its aggravation and its impact on human health and on ecosystem services.

Section 3: Reparation Measures

Article 128: The administration in charge of the Environment shall proceed to evaluate the nature and consequences of the damage.

It may request the exploiter or the operator to carry out his own evaluation.

Any measure of soil reparation must be envisaged.

Article 130: Reparation measures for damage affecting waters, species, and habitats aim to restore these natural resources and their ecosystem services to their initial state and to eliminate any risk of serious harm to human health.

The initial state designates the state of the natural resources and ecosystem services at the time of the damage that would have existed if the environmental damage had not occurred. It is estimated using the best available information.

Article 131: Reparation measures must compensate for the intermediate losses of natural resources or services occurring between the damage and the date on which the reparation has produced its effect.

Article 132: After having given the exploiter formal notice to present his observations, the administration in charge of the Environment shall prescribe, by a reasoned decision, the appropriate reparation measures.

Section 4: Administrative Police Powers

Article 133: In the event of an imminent threat of damage or when such damage has occurred, the administration in charge of the Environment may, at any time, request the exploiter or the operator, who is required to prevent or repair the damage, to provide him with all useful information relating to this threat or this damage and to the prevention or reparation measures provided for by this law.

oblige the exploiter or the operator to deposit in the hands of a public accountant a sum corresponding to the amount of the prescribed prevention or reparation measures, this sum being returned to the exploiter or the operator, according to the execution of these measures;

have the prescribed prevention or reparation measures executed ex officio at the expense of the exploiter or the operator.

Article 136: When damage to the environment or to sustainable development has several causes, the cost of the prevention or reparation measures is distributed by the administration in charge of the environment between the exploiters or operators, up to the degree of involvement of their activity in the damage or in the imminent threat of damage.

Article 137: The administration in charge of the Environment shall proceed or have proceeded with the ex officio execution of the prevention or reparation measures, with the responsibility of recovering the cost from the exploiter or the operator whose activity caused the damage.

Article 140: The presumed civilly liable person cannot be released from his liability solely by the fact of being the holder of an administrative authorization.

Article 141: Unless there are contrary provisions in the texts in force, the cost of the measures taken to reduce, combat, or eliminate pollution or nuisances is borne by the author of the polluting or harmful act.
