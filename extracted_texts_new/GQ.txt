Law Nº 3/2007, of July 23,
Regulating Waters and Coasts in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea

The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is rich in water resources, due to its natural equatorial climatology; with the basins of its great rivers and others of lesser scale that exist throughout the National Territory; the existence of a great flow of subterranean waters with their natural upwellings.

The need for these resources in their entirety for human subsistence, both at the most elementary level and for the promotion of industrial activities, considering that the territorial sea and the national coasts are beginning to be subjected to a significant level of exploitation for industrial activities and the use of aggregates; if the utilization of these resources for use by the population centers adjacent to coasts and beaches is taken into account, as well as for tourist activities.

The importance of coordinating the exploitation of these resources for the satisfaction of the populations both in rural and urban centers; and taking into account the continuous pressure from population growth, it is necessary to ensure the ordering, exploitation, planning, supervision, coordination, sanitation, protection, management, and administration of the set of assets that make up the Public Maritime-Terrestrial Domain (DPMT).

Considering that actions on the public hydrological and maritime-terrestrial domains must be framed within a legal framework, the need arises to promulgate this Law of Waters and Coasts.

By virtue of and having been duly approved by the Chamber of People's Representatives in its sessions held from March 16 to April 20, 2007; I hereby promulgate and sanction this present

Of the common uses of public waters

Article 30.

The free use of navigable and/or non-navigable rivers, coves, roadsteads, bays, and inlets is understood for navigating, fishing, embarking and disembarking, anchoring, and other similar acts, in accordance with the legal or regulatory prescriptions that regulate it and provided that such use has not been the subject of a particular concession or a reservation by the State. In the same case is the use of the beaches, which authorizes everyone, with equal restrictions, to travel through them, bathe, hang and wash clothes and nets, careen and build boats, collect shells, plants, and seafood.

Article 31.

As long as the waters run through their natural and public channels and it is not prevented by a particular concession, everyone may use them to drink, wash clothes, vessels, and any other objects, bathe, and water or bathe livestock, subject to the rules issued for that purpose.

These common uses must be carried out in such a way that no alteration of the quality and flow of the waters is produced. When it comes to waters that circulate through artificial channels, they will also have the limitations derived from the protection of the aqueduct. In no case may the waters be diverted from their channels or beds without the prior authorization of the Environmental Body of the Administration, and the normal regime...

Article 32.

In waters that, having been artificially diverted from their natural and public channels, flow through open canals, irrigation ditches, or aqueducts, even if they belong to private concessions, everyone may extract and carry in a container the amount they need for domestic and industrial uses and for the irrigation of isolated plants; but the extraction must be done precisely by hand, without any kind of machine or apparatus, and without stopping the course of the water, nor deteriorating the banks of the canal or ditch. The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will limit or prohibit the use of this right when it causes harm to the concession holder of the waters. It is understood that no one may access private property to seek or use the water, except with the authorization of the owner.

Article 33.

Everyone may fish in public watercourses, subject to the laws and regulations on fishing matters, provided that navigation and flotation are not disturbed. It is strictly forbidden to fish using explosives or poisoning of the waters, or any other existing means that indiscriminately destroys the species.

Article 34.

In the canals, irrigation ditches, or aqueducts for the conduction of public waters, even if constructed by the concession holders thereof, and unless the use of fishing has been reserved to them by the conditions of the concession, everyone may fish with hooks, nets, or pots, subject to the special laws and regulations on fishing, provided that the course of the water is not obstructed nor the canal or its banks are deteriorated.

Article 35.

In waters of private domain and in those granted for the establishment of fish farms or hatcheries, only the owners may fish.

CHAPTER II
Of Authorizations and Concessions

Article 36.

The use of public waters is acquired by administrative concession in which the duration of the same will be specified.

The right to use public waters is extinguished by the non-use of it for a period of three months from the signing of the concession, by forced expropriation, or by renunciation of the concession holder.

Article 37.

Every natural or legal person who is enjoying a right of water use must present to the environmental inspectors, and other authorities who require it, the authorization mentioned in the previous article to exercise that right.

Article 38.

In concessions for the use of public waters, the concession of the public domain lands necessary for the work of the dam and the canals and irrigation ditches will be understood to be included.

With respect to privately owned lands, the forced easement will be imposed, with the formalities provided for in the law of forced expropriation.

Article 39.

In every concession for the use of public waters, its nature, the period, the quantity in liters of water granted per unit of time shall be specified; and if it were for irrigation, the extension of the land that must be irrigated.

Article 44.

The following are causes for the nullity of concessions:

The lack of use and exploitation of the waters for a period of 90 days, which may be extended for duly justified reasons.

The application of the waters to uses other than those indicated in the concession. If it is for irrigation, for applying the water to other properties different from those for which it was granted, without the permission of the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment.

That the concession holder has been condemned twice for using, to the detriment of third parties, a greater volume of water than that to which he is authorized by the title;

The transfer, assignment, administration, or total or partial encumbrance of the concession, directly or indirectly, in favor of third parties or the admission of these with any kind of participation in the concession or in the company that exploits it without the consent of the Ministry; in the assessment of this circumstance, it would be sufficient for the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment to have the conviction of its existence to decree the nullity, without any claim on the part of the interested parties;

The transfer or encumbrance of the concession, in whole or in part, or of the works to which it refers, without prior authorization from the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment. If the concession had been granted for the irrigation of the concession holder's own lands and were sold together with them, no...

Article 45.

the acquirer had the capacity, according to this law, to be a concession holder of waters. In any case, the acquirer must report the transfer to the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment within two months of the date on which it was consummated. If this period elapses and the acquirer does not give the respective notice, the penalty indicated in Title IX of this Law will be imposed.

Non-compliance with the provisions of article 39.

In concessions for special uses of public waters, the following order of preference will be observed:

Pipelines for populations.

Supply to populations, domestic services, watering troughs, latrines, and baths;

Supply to construction companies and public works, factories, ships, and transport companies;

Development of hydraulic or hydroelectric forces for public services;

Development of hydraulic or hydroelectric forces for private services, as well as the use of water as a means of transport.

Navigation canals.

Irrigation and...

Article 46.

Special uses of public waters may give rise to forced expropriation for reasons of public utility, with prior corresponding compensation, in favor of another use that precedes it, according to the order established in the previous article; but not in favor of those that follow it, unless by virtue of a special law.

Article 47.

In urgent cases of fire, flood, or other public calamity, the authority may dispose instantly and without procedure or prior compensation, but subject to ordinances and regulations, if any, of the waters necessary to contain or prevent the damage. If the waters were public, there will be no place for compensation; but if they had industrial or agricultural application, or were of private domain and with their diversion an appreciable prejudice had been caused, this will be compensated. The claim for damages and prejudices must be formulated within the fifteen days following the date on which the events occurred.

CHAPTER III
Water Conveyance for Populations

Article 48.

By provision of the Government and at the proposal of the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, the waters of rivers and springs, in any part of the national territory where they are found, will be available for the service of water conveyance to the populations.

Article 49.

The following are declared as a domain reserve in favor of the State:

Article 50.

The forest area that protects or should protect the set of lands where the infiltration of potable waters occurs, as well as that which provides a base for hydrographic basins and margins of deposits, supply sources, or permanent course of the same waters.

When in an area larger than the previously indicated one there is a danger of contamination either in surface or subterranean waters, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will dispose in said area the measures it deems appropriate to avoid the danger of contamination.

CHAPTER IV
Supply of water to populations, Domestic services, watering troughs, and baths

Article 51.

The forced expropriation of privately owned waters for the supply of a population will not be decreed until it has been legally declared by the Government, in view of the studies carried out for that purpose, that there are no public waters that can be rationally applied to the same object.

The owners of lands bordering public channels of non-continuous flow such as dry riverbeds, ravines, and other similar ones of public domain, may use for their irrigation the rainwater that flows through them and build for that purpose, without need for authorization or dams.

In navigable and non-navigable rivers, the riverside dwellers may freely establish on their respective margins pumps or any other apparatus intended to extract necessary water for the irrigation of their properties, provided they do not cause prejudice to third parties.

Article 57.

The provisions of the previous article regarding rainwater are applicable to that of discontinuous springs that only flow in times of abundant rainfall.

Article 58.

When it is intended to build permanent dams in order to take advantage of rainwater or discontinuous springs that run through public channels for irrigation, an environmental authorization from the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will be necessary.

Article 59.

When there are uses in operation under a recognized and valid right, a new concession will only be granted in the event that the flow of the waters in ordinary years results in a surplus of the requested flow, after having completely covered the existing uses.

that no person may take the water as long as all the needs of the one with the oldest title or right to use it are not covered.

Article 60.

When the public waters of a river, in whole or in part, run below the surface of the ground, imperceptible to the sight, and levees are built or other means are used to raise their level until they are applicable for irrigation or other uses, this result will be considered, for the effects of this law, as the exploitation of water converted into usable.

The irrigators or industrialists located downstream, who by prescription or by concession had acquired legitimate title to the use and exploitation of those waters that are intended to be made to reappear artificially to the surface, will have the right to claim and oppose the new upstream exploitation, insofar as it would cause them prejudice. If the damage were to occur, they will have the right to resort to the rules of article 48 of this Law.

CHAPTER VIII
Supply of water for factory benefits

Article 61.

The public waters granted to the owners of factories and other industrial companies for the development of hydraulic or hydroelectric forces cannot be used in the processing of their products, without a special concession for that purpose.

TITLE V
Of the works and drainage of lands of the public hydrological and private domain.

Article 66.

Article 70.

If the owner or the majority of the owners refuse to execute the drainage, the Government may entrust it to any private individual or company that offers to carry it out, with prior approval of the corresponding project. The reclaimed land will become the property of whoever has carried out the drainage or reclamation, but paying the former owners the sum corresponding to the acquisition price of the land.

In the event that the owners of the marshy lands declared unhealthy do not want to execute the drainage or do not have sufficient economic means; and there is no private individual or companies that offer to carry it out, the State or the Municipality may execute the works, financing them with the funds that for that purpose are obtained in their respective Budgets. When this occurs, the State or the Municipality will enjoy the same benefits determined by the previous paragraph, in the manner and form established therein, being consequently subject to the prescriptions that govern this class of goods.

TITLE VI
Of the servitudes of the public hydrological and private domain

CHAPTER I
Of the natural legal servitudes and abutment and dam

Article 71.

Natural servitudes will apply when lower lands are obliged to receive the waters that naturally and without the intervention of man flow from the higher ones, as well as the earth or stones that they carry in their course. But if the waters were the product of artificial exploitation or came from...

waters that its land receives, in which case it has no right to such compensation.

Legal servitudes are requested when whoever wants to use public waters does not obtain from the neighbors the corresponding consent for the construction of the necessary works for the use, they may resort to the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, requesting the imposition of the servitude.

once the request is received, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will give a hearing to the owner of the land that will be affected; this one may oppose for the following reasons:

a) for not being the one who requests the servitude a concessionaire of the water or owner of the land that he intends to use for private interest purposes.
b) for being able to establish the servitude on other lands with equal advantages as the one intended to be imposed but with fewer inconveniences.

The owner of the affected land will present his evidence and, once these have been evaluated as well as those offered by the applicant, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will dictate the resolution.

The servitude of watering place, aqueduct, and dam can only be imposed for reasons of public utility in favor of a population, with prior corresponding compensation.

CHAPTER II
Modifications of the uses and regulation of currents

Article 72.

The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, in collaboration with the municipalities, ex officio or at the request of a party, is empowered to modify, without being exposed to payment of damages for any reason, the rights to the use of public waters, whatever the title that protects it...

If they need the waters for pipes, for the supply of populations, watering places, baths, or other public services or transport system supplies. The applicants will have to prove that they do not have another usable supply source for the purpose.

When required by compliance with special laws enacted in favor of populations or agriculture.

When making the regulation of the waters of a current, deposit, or a collective use; and

When undertaking public utility works that have as a consequence the change of the current's regime.

Once the request for modification of rights granted to third parties is received, in accordance with the previous article, an edict will be published in the Official Information Media, and the concessionaires will be notified personally, so that within the following thirty days they may present their objections and offer the relevant evidence.

After this term, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will order the evidence to be received and, once evaluated, will resolve, and said resolution must be published in the Official Information Media.

Against what has been resolved, there is no appeal, except for the one left to the interested party to resort to the ordinary courts for the discussion of their right.

Article 74.

In cases of water scarcity, the following principles are established:

The waters will be applied preferentially to domestic uses, public services, watering places, baths, and supply of transport systems;

If after satisfying the previous uses there is surplus water, but not in the necessary quantity to supply all the uses, it will be distributed proportionally to their needs among the following: irrigation of lands, industrial uses, and motive power for public service companies.

Article 75.

If once the needs of the previous uses are completely covered, there is surplus water, it will be distributed as follows: motive power for private services and industrial use;

If after satisfying the previous uses, there is surplus water, the other needs will be covered.

If the surplus waters are not sufficient in their totality to satisfy the uses referred to in subsection 3 of the previous article, they will be applied with preference to those that have more economic importance for the community. In equality of conditions, the proportional distribution of the waters will be made.

The uses not contemplated in the previous article may only use the excess waters once all the priority needs listed in the preceding article have been satisfied.

CHAPTER III
National reserves of hydraulic energy

Article 76.

The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment may constitute hydraulic reserves for energy generation. Through the declaration that a reserve is constituted, the nationally owned waters included in the reserved zones will no longer be at the disposal of whoever requests them, with the exception of requests for concessions for pipelines for populations and domestic uses that preserve the preference granted to them by the Law.

Article 77.

The declaration that a zone is constituted as a national reserve of hydraulic energy, as well as that it ceases to be so, will be made by means of a decree approved in the Council of Ministers.

TITLE VII
Of the protection of the public hydrological domain and the quality of terrestrial waters.

CHAPTER I
General Norms

Article 78.

The objectives of the protection of the public hydrological domain are:

To prevent the deterioration of the ecological state and the contamination of the waters to achieve a good general state.

To establish quality control programs in each hydrographic basin.

To prevent the accumulation of toxic or dangerous compounds in the subsoil, capable of contaminating subterranean waters.

To avoid any other accumulation that may be a cause of degradation of the public hydrological domain.

To recover the aquatic systems associated with the public hydrological domain.

To establish by regulation the quality levels corresponding to the states indicated in paragraph 1) and the deadlines for achieving them.

Article 79.

For the purposes of this Law, contamination is understood as the action and effect of introducing materials or forms of energy, or inducing conditions in the water that, directly or indirectly, imply a prejudicial alteration of its quality in relation to subsequent uses or its ecological function.

Article 80.

The concept of degradation of the public hydrological domain for the purposes of this Law includes the prejudicial alterations of the environment affected by said domain.

The policing of surface and subterranean waters and of their channels and natural deposits, servitude zones, and protection perimeters will be exercised by the Government, through the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment.

Article 81.

Around the surface reservoirs, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment may provide in its projects for the service zones necessary for their exploitation.

In any case, the margins of the lakes, lagoons, and reservoirs will be subject to the servitude zones and policing fixed for the water currents.

Article 82.

The following contaminating activities are prohibited:

To carry out direct or indirect discharges that constitute or may constitute a danger of contamination of the waters, both surface and subterranean, or of degradation of their environment.

To accumulate garbage, rubble, or substances of any nature, that constitute or may constitute a danger of contamination of the waters or of degradation of their environment, regardless of the place where they are deposited.

To carry out actions on the physical or biological environment affected by the water, that constitute or may constitute a degradation of the same.

Article 83.

The exercise of activities within the protection perimeters established in the Hydrological Plans, when they could constitute a danger of contamination or degradation of the public hydrological domain.

The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, in the concessions and authorizations it grants, with prior report, where appropriate, from the other involved Departments, will adopt the necessary measures to make the use compatible with respect for the environment and to guarantee the ecological flows or environmental demands provided for in the hydrological planning.

In the processing of concessions and authorizations that affect the public hydrological domain and could involve risks for the environment, after hearing the corresponding technical reports, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will pronounce on the corrective measures that, in its judgment, should be introduced as a consequence of the report presented. Without prejudice that, in the cases where it is necessary, due to the existence of a serious risk for the environment, they are subjected to the process of environmental impact assessment.

Article 84.

The protection of subterranean waters against intrusions of saline waters, of continental or maritime origin, will be carried out through the basic criteria included in the Hydrological Plans, with the adoption of the appropriate measures corresponding to the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment.

CHAPTER II
Of discharges into the public hydrological domain.

Article 85.

For the purposes of this Law, discharges that are made directly or indirectly into continental waters as well as into the rest of the public hydrological domain will be considered discharges, whatever the procedure or technique used. The direct or indirect discharge of waters and residual products susceptible of contaminating continental waters or any other element of the public hydrological domain is generally prohibited, unless there is prior administrative authorization.

The authorization of the discharge will have as its objective the achievement of the good ecological state of the waters in accordance with the quality norms, the environmental objectives, and the emission and immission characteristics established by regulation in application of this Law.

By good ecological state of the waters is understood that which is determined from indicators of biological, physicochemical, and hydromorphological quality, inherent to the natural conditions of any hydric ecosystem, in the form and with the evaluation criteria that are determined by regulation.

When the authorization is granted, or its conditions are modified, deadlines and programs for the reduction of contamination may be established for the progressive adaptation of the characteristics of the discharges to the limits that are set in it.

The authorization of discharge does not exempt from any other that may be necessary, in accordance with the laws for the activity or installation in question.

Article 90.

d) for each river, section of river, aquifer, or body of water provided for in the basin's Hydrological Plans.

In exceptional cases, for reasons of drought or in extreme hydrological situations, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment may modify, with a general character, the discharge conditions in order to guarantee the quality objectives.

Once the existence of an unauthorized discharge is confirmed, or one that does not comply with the conditions of the authorization, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will carry out the following actions:

a) To initiate a sanctioning procedure and a determination of the damage caused to the quality of the waters, without prejudice to the general responsibilities that correspond.

b) To liquidate the discharge control fee, in accordance with what is established in article 113.

Complementarily, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment may agree to the initiation of the following procedures:

a) Of revocation of the discharge authorization, when it exists, for the case of non-compliance with any of the conditions.

b) Of authorization of discharge, if it does not exist, when it is susceptible to legalization.

c) Of declaration of nullity of the water concession in cases especially qualified as non-compliance with the conditions or of non-existence of authorization, from which very serious damages in the public hydrological domain result.

Article 91.

The revocations and declarations of nullity agreed upon in accordance with the previous section will not give the right to compensation.

The Government, through the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, may order the suspension of the activities that give rise to unauthorized discharges, or adopt measures for their correction as appropriate, without prejudice to the civil, criminal, or administrative liability that the perpetrators may have incurred.

Article 92.

Discharge companies may be established to conduct, treat, and discharge residual waters of third parties. The discharge authorizations that are granted in their favor will include, in addition to the conditions required with a general character, the following:

a) Those of admissibility of the discharges that are going to be treated by the company.

b) The maximum tariffs and the procedure for their periodic updating.

c) The obligation to constitute a bond to respond for the continuity and effectiveness of the treatments.

CHAPTER III
Of the reuse of treated waters.

Article 93.

The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, in collaboration with other involved services and Departments, will establish the conditions...

basic conditions for the reuse of waters, specifying the quality required for the treated waters according to the intended uses.

The reuse of waters from a water use will require an administrative concession as a general rule.

However, in the case that the reuse is requested by the holder of a discharge authorization for already treated waters, only the administrative authorization will be required, in which the complementary conditions to those included in the prior discharge authorization will be established.

Any natural or legal person who has obtained a concession for the reuse of waters may be subrogated by contractual means in the ownership of the discharge authorization for those waters, with the assumption of the obligations that this entails, including the treatment and satisfaction of the discharge control fee. These contracts must be authorized by the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, for the effects of the change of holder of the discharge authorization. In the case that the concession has been granted with respect to effluent waters from a treatment plant, the relations between the holder of this and that of that concession will be regulated equally by means of a contract that must be authorized by the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment.

The natural or legal persons who assume the obligations referred to in the previous section may request the modification of the previously existing discharge authorization, in order to adapt it to the new discharge conditions. For its revision, the volume and quality of the effluent that is discharged into the public hydrological domain after reuse will be taken into consideration.

In any case, the final discharge of the reused waters will be adapted to the provisions of this Law.

CHAPTER IV
Of Government aid.

Article 94.

At the proposal of the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, the Government will determine by regulation the aid that may be granted to those who proceed with the development, implementation, or modification of technologies, processes, installations, or equipment, as well as changes in operation, that signify a decrease in the uses and consumption of water or a lesser contribution at the origin of contaminating charges to the used waters. Likewise, aid may be granted to those who carry out tree plantations whose objective is the protection of hydrological resources.

This aid will be extended to those who proceed with the potabilization and desalination of waters and the treatment of residual waters, through more adequate processes or methods, to the implementation of systems for the reuse of residual waters, or develop research activities in these matters.

CHAPTER V

TITLE VIII
Of the economic-financial regime of the Utilization of the public hydrological domain.

Article 112.

The occupation, utilization, and exploitation of the assets of the public hydrological domain that require an administrative concession or authorization will accrue a fee called "fee for the utilization of assets of the public hydrological domain," intended for the protection and improvement of said domain, the amounts of which will be deposited in the National Fund for the Management of the Environment (FONAMA). The concession holders of waters will be exempt from the payment of the fee for the occupation or utilization of the public hydrological domain lands necessary to carry out the concession.

The accrual of the fee will occur upon the initial granting and...

Article 113.

the amount that corresponds and within the deadlines indicated in the conditions of said concession or authorization.

The taxable subjects of the fee will be the concessionaires or authorized persons or, where appropriate, those who subrogate themselves in their place.

The taxable base of the levy and the applicable percentages will be determined in the Law of Fiscal Taxes.

Discharges into the public hydrological domain will be taxed with a fee intended for the study, control, protection, and improvement of the receiving environment of each hydrographic basin, which will be called "discharge control fee," and whose amounts will be deposited in the FONAMA.

The taxable subjects of the discharge control fee will be those who carry out the discharge.

The amount of the discharge control fee will be the product of the volume of the authorized discharge multiplied by the unit price of the discharge control. This unit price will be calculated by multiplying the basic price per cubic meter by a surcharge coefficient, depending on the nature, characteristics, and degree of contamination of the discharge, as well as the environmental quality of the physical medium into which it is discharged.

The basic price per cubic meter for urban residual water, and for industrial residual water will be determined in the Regulation for the application of this Law.

Both the amount of the sanctions and that of the responsibilities that may arise may be enforced by way of constraint.

Article 119.

In the cases in which the infractions could constitute a crime, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will pass the matter of guilt to the competent jurisdiction and will abstain from continuing the sanctioning procedure while the judicial authority has not pronounced. The sanction of the judicial authority will exclude the imposition of an administrative fine. If the existence of a crime has not been estimated, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment...

Article 120.

...may continue the sanctioning file based on the facts that the Courts have considered proven.

The contentious-administrative jurisdiction is responsible for the knowledge of the claims that are deduced in relation to the acts of any of the Organs of the Central State Administration in matters of water, subject to Administrative Law.

TITLE X
Of hydraulic works

Article 121.

For the purposes of this Law, a hydraulic work is understood as the construction of goods that have an immovable nature, intended for the capture, extraction, desalination, storage, regulation, conduction, control, and use of waters, as well as the sanitation, purification, treatment, and reuse of the used ones and those that have as their object the artificial recharge of aquifers, the action on channels, the correction of the regime of currents and the protection against floods, such as dams, reservoirs, canals of irrigation ditches, conductions and supply deposits to populations, desalination, capture and pumping installations, sewerage, collectors of pluvial and residual waters, sanitation, purification and treatment installations, gauging stations, piezometers, quality control networks, dikes and channeling works and defense against floods, as well as those necessary actions for the protection of the public hydrological domain.

Article 122.

Hydraulic works can be of public or private ownership. The construction of a hydraulic work that... affects the concession... cannot be initiated without...

Article 123.

...the corresponding concession, authorization, or demand reserves are obtained or declared, except in the case of a declaration of emergency or extreme hydrological situations.

Public hydraulic works are those intended to guarantee the protection, control, and use of continental waters and the public hydrological domain and that are the competence of the Central State Administration and local Entities.

All those not contemplated in point two of this article are private hydraulic works.

Hydraulic works of general interest are the competence of the Central State Administration. The management of these works may be carried out directly by the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, or through other Organs of the Central State Administration with competencies in matters of water and local Entities by virtue of a specific agreement that entrusts the management.

The Central State Administration and the local Entities may celebrate agreements for the joint realization and financing of hydraulic works of their competence.

Article 124.

a. The hydraulic works of general interest and the hydraulic works and actions of a supra-municipal scope, included in the hydrological planning and that do not exhaust their functionality in the municipal term where they are located, will not be subject to a license or any act of municipal preventive control.

b. The competent urban planning bodies may not suspend the execution of the works referred to in the previous section, provided that...

Article 125.

c. the prior report procedure has been complied with, and that the technical project is duly approved by the competent body, the works conform to said project or its modifications, and the communication referred to in the following section has been made.

d. The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will communicate to the affected local Entities the approval of the projects of the public hydraulic works referred to in section 1, so that the procedure for modifying the municipal urban planning is initiated, where appropriate, to adapt it to the implementation of the new infrastructures or installations, in accordance with the urban planning legislation that is applicable depending on the location of the work.

The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, the other Organs of the Central State Administration with competencies in water matters, and the local Entities have the duties of reciprocal coordination of their concurrent competencies on the water medium with an impact on the model of territorial organization, on the availability, quality, and protection of the waters and, in general, of the public hydrological domain, as well as the duties of information and mutual collaboration in relation to the initiatives and projects they promote.

The corresponding regulatory procedures for the coordination and cooperation referred to in the previous section will be established.

The lands reserved in the hydrological plans for the realization of hydraulic works of general interest, as well as those that are strictly necessary for their possible expansion, will have the classification that results from the urban planning legislation.

Article 126.

of said works, the protection of the public hydrological domain and its compatibility with the uses of water and environmental demands. The general instruments of organization and urban planning must include said classification and qualification.

The projects and activities related to the public hydrological domain will be submitted to the environmental impact assessment process in accordance with what is established in Title II of Law Number 7/2003, Regulator of the Environment in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, its annexes, and those that are determined according to what is established in article 83 of this Law.

Article 127.

The approval of the projects of hydraulic works of general interest will carry with it the declaration of public utility and the need for occupation of the goods and acquisition of rights, for the purposes of forced expropriation and temporary occupation, in accordance with the provisions of the corresponding legislation.

The declaration of public utility and need for occupation will also refer to the goods and rights included in the replanning of the project and in the modifications of works that may be approved subsequently.

When the realization of a hydraulic work of general interest singularly affects the socioeconomic balance of the municipal term in which it is located, a restitution project will be prepared and executed to compensate for said affectation.

PART TWO
Public Maritime-Terrestrial Domain (Coasts)

TITLE XI
Determination, protection, utilization, and policing of the public maritime-terrestrial domain, especially the coastal zone.

CHAPTER I
Of the assets that comprise it

Article 128.

The following are assets of the public maritime-terrestrial domain, by virtue of this law:

The shore of the sea and of the rias, which includes:

a) The maritime-terrestrial zone or space comprised between the line of low water at spring tide or maximum equinoctial tide, and the limit up to which the waves reach in the greatest known storms or, when it exceeds it, that of the line of maximum equinoctial high tide. This zone also extends along the banks of the rivers up to the place where the effect of the tides becomes sensible. The marshes, lagoons, salt marshes, estuaries, and, in general, the low-lying lands that are flooded as a consequence of the flow and ebb of the tides, of the waves, or of the filtration of seawater are considered included in this zone.

b) The beaches or zones of deposit of loose materials, such as sands, gravels, and pebbles, including scarps, berms, and dunes, whether they have vegetation or not, formed by the action of the sea or the marine wind, or other natural or artificial causes.

The territorial sea, the Exclusive Economic Zone, the internal waters with their bed and subsoil, defined and regulated in International Maritime Law.

The natural resources of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the Continental Shelf, defined and regulated by its specific legislation.

Article 130.

The works and installations for the illumination of coasts and maritime signaling, constructed by the Government, whatever their location, as well as the lands affected for the service thereof.

The ports and port installations of state ownership, which will be governed by their specific regulation.

Also part of the public maritime domain are the islands that are formed or are formed by natural causes, in the territorial sea or in internal waters or in the rivers, up to where the tides are sensible, except those that are the private property of individuals or public entities or proceed from the dismemberment of it, in which case their maritime-terrestrial zone, beaches, and other goods that have this character will be of public domain.

CHAPTER II
Of the coastal zone.

Article 131.

The coastal zone is defined as the maritime-terrestrial strip of variable width, where the interaction of the land, the sea, and the atmosphere occurs, through natural processes. In it, exclusive forms of fragile ecosystems are developed and particular economic, social, and cultural relations are manifested.

Article 132.

Any natural extension of land, surrounded by water, that is above its level at high tide, including those where there are no conditions to maintain human habitation or economic life, will have its coastal zone and its protection zone determined, as appropriate.

Article 133.

The limits of the coastal zone are established attending to the structure and configuration of the different types of coasts as described below:

Low terrace, constituted by carbonated rocks, including the ridge of loose materials such as boulders, pebbles, gravel, and sands formed during storms, and regularly covered with vegetation. Its limit is established on the extreme edge towards the land of the ridge.

In the absence of the ridge:

a) the limit will be the line located 20 meters towards land, measured from the beginning of the consolidated natural vegetation strip closest to the sea on the terrace;
b) in the presence of the cliff in a second level of terrace, located less than 20 meters towards land, measured from the beginning of the natural vegetation strip closest to the sea on the terrace, the limit towards land will be given by the crest of said cliff;
c) if the area adjacent to the low terrace is a coastal lagoon with mangroves, the limit towards land will be that defined in section 4.

Clifted coast, the area with cliffs whose crest is not surpassed by the storm surges or penetrations of the sea. It will extend 20 meters towards land, from said crest.

Beach, an ecosystem of the coastal zone, constituted by loose materials of different thickness in emerged and submarine areas that manifests processes of erosion and accumulation by alterations of natural origin or...

Article 134.

...The outer limit of the coastal zone towards the sea will be the edge of the continental or insular shelf of the territory, regularly at depths between 100 and 200 meters.

The components that make up the coastal zone are:

All the physical-geographic elements related in article 133 of this Law.

The continental waters, with their bed and subsoil, defined and regulated by this Law.

The living and non-living natural resources contained in this zone, including the protective forests.

The areas that are formed by the deposit of materials or by the retreat of the sea, whatever the causes.

The lands gained from the sea as a direct or indirect consequence of works and the drained lands.

The lands invaded by the sea that become part of its bed for any reason.

The estuaries, bays, roadsteads, and coves.

The works and installations located on the elements that are related in this article 133 are also considered components of the coastal zone.

Article 135.

The protection zone is the terrestrial and maritime space adjacent to the coastal zone that mitigates the negative effects of anthropic actions and whose limits are established depending on the typology established in the previous article.

The limits towards land are fixed in the following manner:

For the types indicated in sections 1, 2, and 5 of article 133, a minimum width of 20 meters is established, measured from the limit towards the land of the coastal zone.

For the types indicated in subsections 3, 4, and 6 of article 133, a minimum width of 40 meters will be established, measured from the limit towards the land of the coastal zone.

CHAPTER III.
Of inalienability.

Article 136.

The assets of the public maritime-terrestrial domain defined in this law are inalienable, imprescriptible, and unseizable.

Article 137.

For the purposes of the previous article, no more rights will be admitted than those of use and exploitation acquired in accordance with this Law, with private declarations lacking optional value against the public domain, however prolonged they may be in time and even if they appear supported by entries in the property registry.

rticle 138.
Private property shall not exist in any of the areas belonging to the public maritime-terrestrial domain, not even in the case of lands gained from the sea or reclaimed on its shore.
Administrative acts that infringe upon the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall be null and void. Private actions in circumvention of the aforementioned precept shall not prevent its due application. An exception is made for established coastal populations with deep roots in said zones, whose use does not contradict what is established by this Law.
Article 139.
The Government, through the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, has the right and duty to investigate the situation of the assets and rights that are presumed to belong to the public maritime-terrestrial domain, for which purpose it may gather all the data and reports it deems necessary and promote the execution of the corresponding demarcation.
Likewise, it shall have the faculty of ex officio possessory recovery at any time over said assets according to the procedure to be established by regulation, with injunctions against the resolutions issued by the Public Administration in the exercise of the competencies configured in this Law and in accordance with the established procedure not being admissible.
CHAPTER IV.
Of Demarcations.
Article 140.
For the determination of the public maritime-terrestrial domain, the opportune demarcations shall be carried out by the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment.
Article 141.
The demarcation procedure shall comply with the following requirements:
The demarcation shall be initiated ex officio or at the request of any interested person and shall be approved by the Government. The maximum period to notify the resolution of the demarcation procedures shall be 12 months.
In the procedure, the corresponding Municipality and Minor Local Bodies, the adjoining property owners, with prior notification, and other persons who prove their status as interested parties shall be heard.
The initiation of the demarcation file shall empower the Government to carry out or authorize, even on private land, the necessary data collection and surveying works, without prejudice to the compensations that may be appropriate for the damages and losses caused and as a result of the demarcation that is definitively approved.
When the interested parties in the file provide registered titles for lands that might turn out to be included in the public domain, the body processing the file shall bring it to the attention of the Registrar so that a preventive marginal note of this circumstance may be made.
The order to initiate the demarcation file shall imply the suspension of the granting of concessions and authorizations in the public maritime-terrestrial domain and in its servitude zone for protection, for which purpose it must be published accompanied by the plan.
The resolution of the demarcation file or of the modification of the existing one shall implicitly carry the lifting of the suspension.
Notwithstanding the above, emergency works may be carried out with the prior authorization of the Government, or by it, to prevent or repair damages.
The approved demarcation, upon confirming the existence of the physical characteristics related in articles 128, 129, and 130, declares the possessory and dominical title in favor of the State, giving rise to the setting of boundary markers, and without the inscriptions in the Property Registry being able to prevail over the public-domain nature of the demarcated assets.
The resolution approving the demarcation shall be sufficient title to rectify, in the form and conditions determined by regulation, the contradictory registry legal situations with the demarcation. Said resolution shall also be sufficient title for the Government to proceed with the first registration of the assets of the public maritime-terrestrial domain when it deems it convenient.
In any case, the affected registered title holders may exercise the actions they deem pertinent in defense of their rights, with the corresponding judicial claim being susceptible to a preventive note.
Article 142.
Civil actions concerning rights related to lands included in the demarcated public domain shall prescribe after two years, counted from the date of the approval of the demarcation.
Article 144.
The same rules of the preceding article shall apply to the registrations of excess area, unless they concern properties with fixed boundaries or of such a nature that they exclude the possibility of invasion of the public maritime-terrestrial domain.
Whenever the registry title contains the indication that the property borders the sea, the boundary shall be understood to refer to the inner limit of the seashore, even in cases of excess area.
CHAPTER V.
Of the use and protection of the public maritime-terrestrial domain and especially of the coastal zone.
Article 145.
The free use of the littoral sea, navigable rivers, coves, roadsteads, bays, and inlets is understood for navigating, fishing, embarking and disembarking, anchoring, and other similar acts, in accordance with the legal or regulatory prescriptions that regulate it. In the same case is the use of the beaches, which authorizes everyone, with equal restrictions, to travel through them, bathe, hang and wash clothes and nets, careen and build boats, bathe livestock, and collect shells, plants, and seafood. An exception is made for cases where a particular concession or a reservation by the State has been granted, areas designated for the interest of defense, security, and internal order, port installations, protected areas with strict management categories, productive and scientific installations, and maritime signals.
Article 146.
The works, projects, or activities that are executed in the coastal zone shall have to guarantee access to the coastal zone and its protection zone from the nearest public road.

The entities that use the resources of the coastal zone are obliged to finance the creation of pedestrian paths, which in all cases shall be rustic, in such a way that the least damage is caused to the ecosystem.
Article 149.
When an entity develops a project or activity that implies the affectation or destruction of public use infrastructures located in the coastal zone, it shall be obliged to enable a coastal area for the location of new public use structures, attending to what the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment indicates for that purpose.
Article 150.
The coastal zone shall remain preferably unoccupied, with the development or execution of activities or installations being authorized only if, due to their very nature, they do not admit another location, such as ports, piers, shipyards, marinas, dry docks, thermoelectric plants, marine cultures, submarine emissaries, submarine parks, installations...
Article 151.
...aids to navigation, salt pans, defense works, regeneration, improvement, and conservation of said zone, forestry and reforestation activities, tourist and recreational installations that do not disturb the Public Domain; and others of a similar nature, provided that the process of Environmental impact assessment has been complied with.
In the spaces of the coastal zone that become unoccupied for any reason, the location of new permanent installations will not be permitted, except in cases duly justified by public utility or social interest or for the activities provided for in the preceding article.
Article 152.
The following are prohibited in the coastal zone and rivers, without prejudice to other specific prohibitions:

Article 169.
The deposits of aggregates, located in the zone of influence, shall be subject to the right of first refusal and withdrawal in operations of sale, assignment, or any other form of transfer, in favor of the State, for their contribution to the beaches. For this same purpose, said deposits may be declared of public utility for the effects of their total or partial expropriation, as the case may be, by the Government.
TITLE XIII
Authorizations and Concessions
CHAPTER I
General Provisions
Article 170.
The activities carried out in the public maritime-terrestrial domain that, even without requiring works or installations of any kind, involve special circumstances of intensity, dangerousness, or profitability, as well as the occupation of the public maritime-terrestrial domain with removable installations or with movable property, shall be subject to prior environmental authorization.
Removable installations shall be understood as those that:
Article 171.
b) Are constituted by prefabricated series elements, modules, panels, or similar, without the elaboration of materials on site or the use of welding.
c) Are assembled and disassembled through sequential processes, allowing their removal without demolition and with the set of their elements being easily transportable.
For the granting of authorizations and concessions, the following requirements shall be taken into account:
a) The applications accompanied by the basic construction project, and/or use, and the proof of the constitution of the guarantees that may correspond, will be processed in the manner determined in the general clauses of the concessions and authorizations.
b) The granting to foreigners will be regulated, for which special or additional requirements may be established.
c) In the granting of concessions and authorizations, the order of preference established in the corresponding general and specific norms will be observed. In its absence, those of greater public utility will be prioritized. Only in case of identity between several applications will the priority in the presentation be taken into account.
d) Concessions and authorizations in the public maritime-terrestrial domain will be granted respecting the provisions of the territorial planning instruments, or in the urban planning, whatever its denomination and scope, that affect the coast, unless its granting is not appropriate for reasons of public interest or when they threaten the integrity of the public maritime-terrestrial domain.
e) In the event that the works subject to concession or the activities or installations subject to authorization are not foreseen in the aforementioned planning instruments and do not oppose their determinations, or when these do not exist, consultative reports will be requested from the Municipality in whose territorial areas they fall.
f) The Government may call for tenders for the granting of concessions and authorizations in the public maritime-terrestrial domain.
Article 172.
g) The tender may be declared void if none of the offers presented meets the adequate conditions.
In every title of granting, which will have a public character, the pertinent conditions will be set and, in any case, the following:
a) Object and extent of the occupation.

Article 173.
Authorizations shall be granted with a personal and non-transferable inter vivos character, except in the case of discharges, and shall not be registrable in the property registry. The expiration period shall not exceed one year, except in cases where this Law establishes otherwise.
Article 174.
Authorizations may be unilaterally revoked by the Government at any time, without right to compensation, when they become incompatible with the regulations approved subsequently, cause damage to the public domain, prevent its use for activities of greater public interest, or impair public use. Once the authorization is extinguished, the holder will have the right to remove the corresponding installations from outside the public domain and its servitude zones and will be obliged to said removal when the Government so determines, in the form and period established by regulation. In any case, he will be obliged to restore the altered physical reality.
CHAPTER II
Discharges into the public maritime-terrestrial domain.
The provisions of this chapter are applicable to discharges, both liquid and solid, whatever the asset of the public maritime-terrestrial domain in which it is carried out. Discharges into the sea from ships and aircraft will be regulated by their specific legislation. The dumping of solid waste and rubble into the sea and its shores, as well as in the protection servitude zone, will be prohibited, except when they are usable as fill and are duly authorized.
Article 174.
All discharges will require authorization from the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, based on the quality objectives set for the receiving medium of contamination. Discharges will be limited to the extent permitted by the state of the art, raw materials, and, especially, by the absorption capacity of the contaminant load, without a significant alteration of said medium being produced.
Article 175.
In the case of contaminating discharges, it will be necessary for the petitioner to previously justify the impossibility or difficulty of applying an alternative solution for the elimination or treatment of said discharges. Substances may not be discharged nor forms of energy introduced that may entail a danger or harm superior to that admissible for public health and the natural environment, in accordance with the current regulations, which must be strictly observed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment through all the means at its disposal.
Article 176.
Among the conditions to be included in the discharge authorizations, the following shall be included:
Expiration period, not exceeding 3 years.
Installations for the necessary treatment, purification, and evacuation, establishing their characteristics and the elements of control of their operation, with the setting of the dates of initiation and termination of their execution, as well as their entry into service.
Annual volume of discharge.
Qualitative limits of the discharge and deadlines, if applicable, for the progressive
Evaluation of the effects on the receiving medium, quality objectives of the waters in the receiving zone, and provisions that, if necessary, must be adopted to reduce contamination.
Discharge fee.
Specify the zone and the depth where the discharges have been made.

Article 177.
The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment may modify the conditions of the discharge authorizations, without right to compensation, when the circumstances that motivated their granting have been altered or when others arise that, had they existed previously, would have justified their denial or their granting in different terms. Likewise, if it considers it necessary, it may suspend the effects of the authorization until the new established conditions are met.
Article 178.
In the event that the holder of the authorization does not carry out the modifications within the period indicated for that purpose, the latter may declare the expiration of the discharge authorization, without prejudice to the imposition of the appropriate sanctions.
The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment may carry out as many analyses and inspections as it deems convenient to check the characteristics of the discharge and to verify, where appropriate, compliance with the conditions imposed in the discharge authorization.
Article 179.
In those cases in which the discharge may lead to the infiltration or storage of substances susceptible to contaminating the waters or layers...
Article 180.
...of subterranean waters, a prior hydrogeological study that justifies its harmlessness will be required.
Without prejudice to what is established in other specific laws and the requirements that the programs of control and reduction of contamination by hydrocarbon discharges to the sea entail, oil refineries, chemical and petrochemical factories, and liquid fuel supply installations that have cargo and discharge terminals for hydrocarbons in the ports, territorial sea, and internal waters, must have, in the vicinity of the terminals, reception facilities for hydrocarbon residues and as many other means as are established by the current provisions on the matter of contamination of the sea waters to prevent and combat spills. Likewise, the platforms and installations dedicated to the prospecting of hydrocarbons in the sea, their exploitation, or storage must have the precise means to prevent and combat the spills that may occur.
Article 181.
The administrative authorizations for the establishment, modification, or transfer of installations or industries that cause or may cause discharges into the public maritime-terrestrial domain will be granted conditional upon obtaining the corresponding discharge authorizations, concessions for occupation of said domain, and a prior study of the environmental impact.
Article 182.
The Ministry of Fisheries and Environment may prohibit, in specific zones, those industrial processes whose effluents, despite the treatment to which they have been subjected, may constitute a risk of contamination superior to the admissible level.
CHAPTER III
Extraction of aggregates and dredging
Article 183.
Aggregates constitute assets of the public maritime-terrestrial domain; their extraction requires prior environmental authorization. For this, it will be necessary:
The realization of an environmental impact study which will determine whether or not said activities are authorized in the requested places.
In the realization of the environmental impact study, the following aspects will be included:
a) The effects on the public maritime-terrestrial domain, referring both to the place of extraction or dredging and to the place of discharge, as the case may be.
b) The stability of the beach will be safeguarded, considering its needs for aggregate contribution as a priority.
Article 184.
Among the conditions of the authorization for the extraction of aggregates and dredging, the following will be included:
The period for which it is granted.
The volume to be extracted, dredged, or discharged into the public maritime-terrestrial domain, the rhythm of these actions, and the effective working time.
The procedure and machinery for execution.
The destination and, where appropriate, the place of discharge, in the public domain, of the extracted or dredged products.
The means and guarantees for the effective control of these conditions.
Article 185.
In the event that prejudicial effects occur for the public domain and its use, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment may modify the initial conditions to correct them, or even revoke the authorization without any right to compensation for its holder.
CHAPTER IV
Concessions.
All occupation or use of the assets of the public maritime-terrestrial domain will be subject to prior authorization or administrative concession, as the case may be, granted by the Government.
Article 186.
The granting of the authorization or concession referred to in the preceding article does not exempt its holder from obtaining the other authorizations that are required by other departments or administrations, by virtue of their specific competencies.
Article 187.
Prior to the resolution on the application for the concession, there will be a public information period, and the petitioner must adjust to the conditions established by the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, without which requirement it will not be granted. Once these procedures are completed, the corresponding resolution will be issued, at the discretion of the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment. If the concessionaire challenges the clauses established by the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, the latter may declare the title extinguished.
Article 188.
The expropriated assets and rights will be incorporated into the public maritime-terrestrial domain by the concessionaire, in the manner provided for in the concession title...
Article 189.

Sanctions
General provisions.
Any action or omission that constitutes an infraction will be sanctioned with the fine that proceeds according to articles 203 and 204 of this Law.
If the same act or omission constitutes two or more infractions, the accumulation of infractions and sanctions will be taken into consideration. However, the holders of concessions granted in accordance with this Law may always be sanctioned for the infractions established therein, regardless of other responsibilities that, where appropriate, are demandable.
When, in the judgment of the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, the infraction could be constitutive of a crime or offense, the administrative body will transfer the matter to the Public Prosecutor's Office, refraining from pursuing the sanctioning procedure while the judicial authority has not pronounced. The criminal sanction will exclude the imposition of an administrative sanction.

In case of recidivism in serious infractions, the temporary or permanent disqualification to be a holder of environmental authorizations and concessions may be declared.
Without prejudice to the criminal or administrative sanction that is imposed, the infringer will be obliged to the restitution of the things and the repositioning of the public good to its previous state, with compensation for irreparable damages and prejudices caused, within the period that in each case is set in the corresponding resolution.
When the infraction derives from the non-compliance with the conditions of the administrative title, its expiration will be declared.

Article 207.
Once the existence of a possible infraction is noted, the competent body, after the opportune inquiries, will initiate a sanctioning file against the alleged infringer and will notify him of the statement of charges so that he may formulate the allegations he deems appropriate.
The period for the notification of the resolution of the sanctioning procedures will be sixty days, after which, if it has not occurred, the procedure will be considered expired, and the actions will be filed.
Article 208.
When it comes to illegal works in the course of execution, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will order their paralysis at the moment of the initiation of the sanctioning file. When it comes to installations in operation, it will order the suspension of the improper use or activity, once the pertinent allegations have been dismissed, as the case may be. In both cases, the sealing of the works or installations may be carried out.
In case of extraction of aggregates or water intake, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will order their paralysis and will apply the corresponding sanctions.
Article 209.
For the effectiveness of the paralysis, suspension, or prohibition provided for in the preceding article, as well as for the ex officio recovery of the public maritime-terrestrial domain, the Ministry of Fisheries and Environment will request, when necessary, the collaboration of the forces of public order.

TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
FIRST;
The holders of spaces in the maritime-terrestrial zones, beaches, and territorial sea, which had been declared of private property prior to the entry into force of this Law, will become holders of a right of occupation and use of the public maritime-terrestrial domain, for which purpose they must request the corresponding concession within a period of six months from the aforementioned date.

Likewise, they will have preference, during a period of three years, for obtaining the rights of occupation or use that, where appropriate, may be granted on said lands. All this without prejudice to the civil actions that they may exercise in defense of their rights.
In the sections of the coast where the public maritime-terrestrial domain is not demarcated or is partially so upon the entry into force of this Law, the practice of the corresponding demarcation will be carried out, whose approval will have the effects provided for in sections 7 and 8 of article 141, for all the lands that are included in the public domain, even if they have been occupied by works.
