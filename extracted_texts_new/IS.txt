Chapter III. Environmental Objectives.

Article 11. Classification of Bodies of Water and Environmental Objectives.
Water shall be classified into bodies of water and types of water bodies, and these shall be assessed.
The assessment of a body of surface water shall be based on available data at any given time and shall consider, for each type of water body, defined biological quality elements as well as hydro-morphological and chemical and physico-chemical elements, as appropriate.
Environmental objectives are defined by types of water bodies and shall be comparable.

Environmental objectives are defined by types of groundwater bodies and shall be comparable.
The assessment of the quality elements of surface and groundwater bodies shall be based on environmental objectives in accordance with provisions set by the Minister in a regulation, cf. Art. 29.
Environmental objectives shall be set in the river basin management plan in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Article 12. Surface Water and Groundwater.
Surface and groundwater bodies shall be protected, and it shall be ensured that their status does not deteriorate. Their status shall be enhanced and restored with the objective of achieving at least good chemical status. Furthermore, the sustainable use of groundwater shall be ensured so that a balance is maintained between abstraction and recharge.

Article 13. Artificial and Heavily Modified Bodies of Water.
The Environment Agency shall assess whether a body of water is considered artificial or heavily modified.
The status of an artificial or heavily modified body of surface water shall be protected so that it does not deteriorate, and its status shall be enhanced with the objective of achieving good ecological potential and good chemical status. Efforts shall be made to achieve the best possible ecological potential in such a body of water.
A body of surface water may be designated as artificial or heavily modified if the necessary changes to its physico-chemical, ecological, and hydro-morphological characteristics to achieve good ecological status have significant adverse effects on the environment or on the following uses:
a. navigation, ports, or recreational facilities,
b. activities involving the storage, transfer, and diversion of water, e.g., drinking water supply, power generation, or irrigation,
c. flood protection, drainage, or
d. other sustainable uses of equal importance to the foregoing.
The provisions of paragraph 3 shall apply when the beneficial objectives served by the modified characteristics of the body of water cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option. It shall be stated in the river basin management plan if it is considered that the conditions of paragraph 3 are met, and the reasons for this shall be provided.

Article 14. Harmful and Persistent Substances (Priority Substances).
Pollution from harmful and persistent substances (priority substances) in water shall be progressively reduced through targeted measures with the aim of ceasing their discharge.
Substances shall be prioritized, and a time-bound plan for the restriction and prohibition of their discharge shall be presented, based on the degree of risk they pose to water and the terrestrial environment. The prioritization shall be based on a risk assessment method.

Article 15. Deadlines.
The environmental objectives under Art. 11 shall be achieved no later than six years after the first river basin management plan has been approved. An extension may be granted for achieving the environmental objectives twice, for up to six years at a time, provided that the status of the impacted body of water does not deteriorate further and at least one of the following conditions is met:
a. it is not technically feasible to make improvements within the time limits,
b. the cost of improvements within the time limits would be disproportionately high, or
c. natural conditions are such that improvements to the body of water within the time limits are not feasible.
An extension beyond what follows from paragraph 1 shall only be granted if natural conditions are such that the environmental objectives under Art. 11 cannot be achieved.

Article 16. Less Stringent Environmental Objectives.
Less stringent environmental objectives than those provided for in Art. 11 may be set if a body of water is subject to such pressure that it is impossible or disproportionately expensive to meet the requirements for environmental objectives. The following conditions must then be met:
a. it is not possible to achieve a better environmental outcome without disproportionate cost, taking into account environmental and macroeconomic needs,
b. the best possible status of surface water and groundwater is ensured, and it is ensured that the status of surface water and groundwater changes as little as possible from being good, taking into account the pressure that exists,
c. it is ensured that the status of the body of water does not deteriorate further.

Article 17. Natural Causes and Force Majeure.
It shall not be considered a breach of the requirements for environmental objectives under this Act if the ecological status of a body of water is temporarily impaired due to natural causes or force majeure.
In such circumstances, such measures as are realistic shall be taken to prevent the status of the body of water from deteriorating further than it has and to prevent harm from being caused to another body of water.

Article 18. Modification of a Body of Water.
The Environment Agency may authorize a modification of a body of water which results in the failure to achieve the environmental objectives under Art. 11 in the case of:
a. modifications, such as due to pollution or in connection with climate change, to the water quality, ecological, hydro-morphological, or chemical and physico-chemical characteristics of a body of surface water or to the level of a body of groundwater, or
b. new sustainable activities or modifications that result in the status of a body of surface water changing from very good to good.
In addition to the conditions set out in paragraph 1, all of the following conditions must be met:
a. all measures that are considered realistic shall be taken to mitigate the adverse effects on the status of the body of water,
b. the purposes of the activities or uses outweigh the benefits of achieving the environmental objectives for public welfare and/or for human health and safety or for sustainable development,
c. the purposes of the activities or uses cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option.
