avoid a detrimental change in water body properties,

ensure the economical use of water required with regard to the water balance,

maintain the efficiency of the water balance and

avoid an increase and acceleration of water runoff.

(2) Every person who may be affected by flooding is obliged, within the scope of what is possible and reasonable for them, to take suitable precautionary measures to protect against adverse flood consequences and to reduce damage, in particular to adapt the use of land to the possible adverse consequences for people, the environment, or property from flooding.

Chapter 2
Management of Water Bodies
Section 1
Common Provisions

§ 6 General principles of water body management
(1) Water bodies are to be managed sustainably, in particular with the aim of

preserving and improving their function and efficiency as a component of the natural environment and as a habitat for animals and plants, in particular by protecting them from detrimental changes in water body properties,

avoiding impairments, also with regard to the water balance of terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands directly dependent on the water bodies, and compensating for unavoidable, not merely minor impairments as far as possible,

using them for the public good and, in harmony with it, also in the interest of individuals,

preserving or creating existing or future possibilities for use, in particular for the public water supply,

preventing possible consequences of climate change,

ensuring natural and harmless runoff conditions in surface waters as far as possible, and in particular preventing the occurrence of adverse flood consequences by retaining water in the area,

contributing to the protection of the marine environment.
Sustainable water management must ensure a high level of protection for the environment as a whole; in this context, possible shifts of adverse impacts from one protected good to another, as well as the requirements of climate protection, must be taken into account.

(2) Water bodies that are in a natural or near-natural state shall be preserved in this state, and natural water bodies that have not been developed in a near-natural way shall be restored to a near-natural state as far as possible, if overriding reasons of public good do not conflict with this.

§ 6a Principles for the costs of water services and water uses
(1) For water services, the principle of cost recovery must be taken into account to achieve the management objectives under §§ 27 to 31, 44, and 47. In this context, environmental and resource costs must also be considered. Appropriate incentives must be created to use water efficiently, thus contributing to the achievement of the management objectives.

(2) If certain water uses jeopardize the achievement of the management objectives mentioned in subsection 1, water uses, in particular in the sectors of industry, households, and agriculture, must contribute appropriately to covering the costs of water services.

(3) Within the framework of subsections 1 and 2, the polluter-pays principle and the economic analysis of water uses according to the Surface Waters Ordinance and the Groundwater Ordinance shall be taken as a basis.

(4) Deviations from the principles under subsections 1 and 2 may be made with regard to the social, ecological, and economic impacts of cost recovery, as well as with regard to regional geographical or climatic particularities.

(5) Further regulations of the Federation and the Länder on the collection of costs and fees in the area of water management remain unaffected.

§ 7 Management by river basin districts
(1) Water bodies shall be managed by river basin districts. The river basin districts are:

Danube,

Rhine,

Meuse,

Ems,

Weser,

Elbe,

Eider,

Oder,

Schlei/Trave,

Warnow/Peene.
The river basin districts are shown in map form in Appendix 2.

(2) The competent authorities of the Länder shall coordinate their water management plans and measures with each other, insofar as the interests of river basin-related water management require this.

(3) To achieve the management objectives set out in this Act,

the competent authorities of the Länder shall coordinate the programmes of measures and management plans with the competent authorities of other Member States of the European Union in whose territory the river basin districts also lie,

the competent authorities of the Länder shall seek coordination corresponding to number 1 with the competent authorities of states that are not members of the European Union.

(4) Insofar as the administration of the federal waterways is affected, the agreement of the Directorate-General for Waterways and Shipping must be obtained for coordination under subsections 2 and 3. Insofar as matters of national interest in the cultivation of relations with the European Union, with foreign states, or with international organizations are affected, the agreement of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection must be obtained for coordination under subsection 3.

(5) The competent authorities of the Länder shall assign the river basins of surface waters and coastal waters and the groundwater to a river basin district within the state borders. For coastal waters, this applies to the areas on the landward side of a line every point of which is at a distance of one nautical mile on the seaward side from the nearest point of the baseline from which the breadth of territorial waters is measured, at least up to the outer boundary of the waters that are essentially influenced by freshwater flows. The Länder can also regulate the assignment by law.

§ 8 Permit, license
(1) The use of a water body requires a permit or a license, unless otherwise provided for by this Act or by provisions issued on the basis of this Act.

(2) Water body uses that serve to avert an imminent danger to public safety do not require a permit or license, provided that the impending damage outweighs the adverse changes in water body properties associated with the use. The competent authority must be informed of the use without delay.

(3) Furthermore, no permit or license is required for exercises and tests for the purpose of defense or the aversion of dangers to public safety for

the temporary abstraction of water from a water body,

the re-introduction of water into a water body by means of mobile installations, and

the temporary introduction of substances into a water body,
if other persons are not or only insignificantly impaired by these uses and no adverse change in the properties of the water body is to be expected. The competent authority must be notified of the water body use in good time before the start of the exercise or test.

(4) Unless otherwise specified when the permit or license is granted, the permit or license transfers to the legal successor with the water use facility or, if granted for a piece of land, with this land.

§ 9 Uses
(1) Uses within the meaning of this Act are

the abstraction and diversion of water from surface waters,

the impoundment and lowering of surface waters,

the abstraction of solid substances from surface waters, insofar as this affects the properties of the water body,

the introduction and discharge of substances into water bodies,

the abstraction, bringing to the surface, conveyance to the surface, and diversion of groundwater.

(2) Insofar as a use under subsection 1 is not already present, the following are also considered uses:

the impoundment, lowering, and diversion of groundwater by means of facilities intended or suitable for this purpose,

measures that are suitable to cause permanent or not merely insignificant adverse changes in the water quality,

the breaking up of rock under hydraulic pressure for the exploration or extraction of natural gas, crude oil, or geothermal energy, including the associated deep drillings,

the underground storage of formation water that arises from measures under number 3 or other measures for the exploration or extraction of natural gas or crude oil.

(3) Measures that serve the development of a water body within the meaning of § 67 (2) are not uses. The same applies to measures for the maintenance of a water body, provided that no chemical agents are used.

§ 10 Content of the permit and the license
(1) The permit grants the authority, the license grants the right, to use a water body for a specific purpose in a manner determined by type and measure.

(2) A permit and a license do not grant a claim to the inflow of water in a specific quantity and quality.

BGBl. I 2015, 153)

§ 11 Permit and licensing procedures
(1) A permit and a license for a project that is subject to an environmental impact assessment under the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment may only be granted in a procedure that meets the requirements of said Act.

(2) The license may only be granted in a procedure in which affected parties and participating authorities can raise objections.

§ 11a Procedures for projects for the generation of energy from renewable sources
(1) Subsections 2 to 5 apply supplementarily to the granting of a permit or license for the following projects:

Construction and operation as well as modernization of plants for the use of hydropower, excluding pumped-storage power plants,

Construction and operation of plants for the extraction of geothermal energy, if a mining operation plan is not required.
Modernization within the meaning of sentence 1 number 1 includes measures to increase the efficiency or capacity of the plant, in particular the complete or partial replacement of the plant, a part of the plant, or the operating system.

(2) At the request of the project proponent, the permit or licensing procedure and all other authorization procedures required for the implementation of the project under federal or Land law shall be handled through a single point of contact.

(3) The single point of contact under subsection 2 shall provide a procedural manual for project proponents and shall also make this information available on the internet. In doing so, it shall also specifically address smaller projects and projects for self-supply of electricity. In the information published on the internet, the single point of contact shall also indicate for which projects it is competent and which other single points of contact in the respective Land are competent for projects under subsection 1 sentence 1.

(4) Upon receipt of the complete application documents, the competent authority shall immediately draw up a timetable for the further procedure under subsection 1 sentence 1 and shall communicate this timetable in the cases of subsection 2 to the single point of contact, otherwise to the project proponent.

(5) The competent authority shall decide on the granting of the permit or license

within one year for
a) the construction and operation of plants for the use of hydropower with a power generation capacity of less than 150 kilowatts,
b) the construction and operation of plants for the extraction of geothermal energy, if the project is for the generation of electricity with a capacity of less than 150 kilowatts,
c) the modernization of plants for the use of hydropower,

within two years for
a) the construction and operation of plants for the use of hydropower with a power generation capacity of 150 kilowatts or more,
b) the construction and operation of plants for the extraction of geothermal energy, if the project is for the generation of electricity in a power plant.
The competent authority may extend the respective period under sentence 1 once by up to 18 months and at most by 24 months, insofar as the examination of requirements under environmental law provisions, which serve to implement corresponding regulations of the European Communities or the European Union, in particular the examination of compliance with the management objectives, is associated with increased time expenditure. In all other respects, the competent authority may extend the respective period under sentence 1 by up to one year if exceptional circumstances exist. It shall notify the extension of the period under sentence 2 or sentence 3 in the cases of subsection 2 to the single point of contact, otherwise to the project proponent. In total, the maximum duration of the extension of the period under sentence 2 and sentence 3 is 18 and at most 24 months. The period under sentence 1 begins upon receipt of the complete application documents. Existing legal provisions of the Länder that provide for shorter periods remain unaffected.

(6) Subsections 4 and 5 sentence 1 number 1 letter b and number 2 letter b apply accordingly to the granting of a permit or license for the construction and operation of plants for the extraction of geothermal energy if a mining operation plan is required.

§ 12 Prerequisites for granting the permit and the license, management discretion
(1) The permit and the license shall be refused if

harmful water body alterations that cannot be avoided or compensated for, including by ancillary provisions, are to be expected, or

other requirements under public-law provisions are not met.

(2) In all other respects, the granting of the permit and the license is at the due discretion (management discretion) of the competent authority.

§ 13 Content-related and ancillary provisions of the permit and the license
(1) Content-related and ancillary provisions are also permissible subsequently, as well as for the purpose of avoiding or compensating for adverse effects on others.

(2) The competent authority may, through content-related and ancillary provisions, in particular

establish requirements for the quality of substances to be introduced or discharged,

order measures that
a) are contained in a programme of measures under § 82 or are necessary for its implementation,
b) are necessary to ensure that water is used sparingly with regard to the water balance,
c) serve to determine the properties of the water body before use or to observe the use of the water body and its effects,
d) are necessary to compensate for a detrimental change in water body properties attributable to the use,

require the appointment of responsible operational officers, unless the appointment of a water protection officer is prescribed or can be ordered under § 64,

impose on the user appropriate contributions to the costs of measures that a public body has taken or will take to avoid or compensate for an impairment of the public good associated with the use.

(3) For the license, subsection 1 applies with the proviso that subsequently only content-related and ancillary provisions within the meaning of subsection 2 numbers 1 to 4 are permissible.

§ 13a Refusal and prerequisites for granting the permit for certain water body uses; independent expert commission
(1) A permit for a water body use under § 9 (2) numbers 3 and 4 shall be refused if

shale, clay, marl, or coal seam rock is to be fractured for the exploration or extraction of natural gas or crude oil, or

the water body use is to take place in or under
a) a designated water protection area,
b) a designated curative spring protection area,
c) an area from which surface runoff flows via surface waters
aa) into a natural lake from which water is directly abstracted for public water supply, or
bb) into a reservoir that serves the public water supply,
d) a catchment area of a water abstraction point for public water supply,
e) a catchment area of a well under the Water Security Act, or
f) a catchment area
aa) of a mineral water source,
bb) of a curative spring, or
cc) of a point for the abstraction of water for the production of food.
Sentence 1 number 2 letter b and letter f sub-letter bb do not apply if rock is to be fractured to develop or maintain a curative spring. Upon request of the holder of the permit for the water abstraction, who shall provide the necessary documents, the competent authority shall identify areas under sentence 1 number 2 letters c to f in maps in accordance with the generally accepted rules of technology and shall publish the maps for the areas under sentence 1 number 2 letters c, d, and f on the internet. Sentence 1 number 2 letters a and b and sentence 3 apply accordingly to areas that are designated for establishment as water protection areas or as curative spring protection areas, for a period of 36 months after their designation as proposed protection areas in accordance with sentence 3. The competent authority may extend the period under sentence 4 by up to twelve months if special circumstances so require.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection 1 sentence 1 number 1, permits may be granted for four test measures for the purpose of scientifically researching the effects on the environment, in particular the subsurface and the water balance. The permits under sentence 1 require the consent of the respective state government. In the decision under sentence 2, the geological particularities of the affected areas and other public interests shall be weighed.

(3) It may be determined by Land law that permits for uses under § 9 (2) numbers 3 and 4 may only be granted under certain conditions or are to be refused, also in or under areas where underground mining is or has been conducted. The competent authority shall identify areas under sentence 1 in maps.

(4) If the granting of a permit for a use under § 9 (2) number 3 is not excluded under subsection 1 or subsection 3, the permit may only be granted if

the mixtures used
a) are classified as non-hazardous to water in the cases of subsection 2,
b) are classified as non-hazardous or slightly hazardous to water in the other cases, and

it is ensured that the state of the art is complied with.

(5) If the granting of a permit for a use under § 9 (2) number 4 is not excluded under subsection 1 or subsection 3, the permit may only be granted if it is ensured that the state of the art is complied with and in particular the requirements of § 22c of the General Federal Mining Ordinance of 23 October 1995 (BGBl. I p. 1466), last amended by Article 2 of the Ordinance of 4 August 2016 (BGBl. I p. 1957), are met.

(6) The Federal Government shall appoint an independent expert commission, which shall scientifically accompany and evaluate the test measures carried out under subsection 2 and shall prepare experience reports on this and on the state of the art on 30 June of each year, beginning on 30 June 2018. The expert commission shall transmit the experience reports to the German Bundestag on the dates specified in sentence 1 and shall publish them on the internet. The expert commission shall inform the public at regular intervals about the course and results of the test measures under subsection 2; in this context, as well as on the drafts of the experience reports under sentence 1, the public shall be given the opportunity to comment. The independent expert commission under sentence 1 shall be composed of

a representative of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources,

a representative of the Federal Environment Agency,

a representative of a Land office for geology, appointed by the Bundesrat, which is not responsible for the authorization of the test measures,

a representative of the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam German Research Centre for Geosciences,

a representative of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig, and

a representative of a Land authority responsible for water management, appointed by the Bundesrat, which is not responsible for the authorization of the test measures.
The members of the expert commission are not bound by instructions. The expert commission shall adopt its own rules of procedure and elect a chairperson from among its members.

(7) In the year 2021, the German Bundestag shall review the appropriateness of the prohibition under subsection 1 sentence 1 number 1 on the basis of the then-current state of science and technology.

§ 13b Application documents and monitoring for certain water body uses; substance register
(1) The application for a permit for a water body use under § 9 (2) number 3 or number 4 must in particular contain the information specified in § 2 (1) number 3 of the Ordinance on the Environmental Impact Assessment of Mining Projects of 13 July 1990 (BGBl. I p. 1420), last amended by Article 1 of the Ordinance of 4 August 2016 (BGBl. I p. 1957). The competent authority shall publish the information under § 2 (1) number 3 letter a of this Ordinance on the internet within two weeks of the application being submitted.

(2) The permit for water body uses under § 9 (2) numbers 3 and 4 shall in particular regulate how

the quality of the groundwater and surface waters in the area of influence of the measures is to be regularly monitored during and after their implementation, and

the results of the monitoring are to be reported to the competent authority in writing or electronically.

(3) The permit for water body uses under § 9 (2) number 3 shall, in addition, regulate in particular the regular monitoring under § 22b sentence 1 numbers 2 and 3 of the General Federal Mining Ordinance, as well as the obligation to report the results of the monitoring to the competent authority in writing or electronically.

(4) The holder of the permit shall immediately inform the competent authority of any adverse changes in the quality of the groundwater, a surface water body, or the soil resulting from

uses under § 9 (2) number 3 or number 4, or

uses under § 9 (1) number 4 or number 5 that are connected with uses under § 9 (2) number 3 or number 4.
The competent authority shall publish information under sentence 1 on the internet within two weeks of being informed.

(5) An ordinance under § 23 (1) number 11 may regulate the establishment and maintenance of an internet-based register, freely and gratuitously accessible to everyone, for substances that are used or deposited in connection with water body uses under § 9 (2) numbers 3 and 4.

§ 14 Special provisions for the granting of the license
(1) The license may only be granted if the water body use

cannot be reasonably expected of the user without a secured legal position,

serves a specific purpose that is pursued according to a specific plan, and

is not a use within the meaning of § 9 (1) number 4 and (2) numbers 2 to 4, with the exception of the re-introduction of non-detrimentally altered driving water at diversion power plants.

(2) The license shall be granted for a specific appropriate period, which may exceed 30 years in special cases.

(3) If it is to be expected that the water body use will have an adverse effect on the right of a third party and this third party raises objections, the license may only be granted if the adverse effects are avoided or compensated for by content-related or ancillary provisions. If this is not possible, the license may nevertheless be granted if required by reasons of public good. In the cases of sentence 2, the affected person shall be compensated.

(4) Subsection 3 sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly if a third party, without impairment of a right, is to expect adverse effects because

the water runoff, the water level, or the water quality is altered,

the previous use of their property is impaired,

water is withdrawn from their water abstraction facility, or

the water body maintenance incumbent upon them is made more difficult.
Insignificant and such adverse effects that would have been avoided if the affected person had properly carried out the water body maintenance incumbent upon them shall be disregarded. The license may also be granted if the benefit to be expected from the intended water body use considerably outweighs the detriment to be expected for the affected person.

(5) If the affected person has raised objections under subsection 3 or subsection 4 and it cannot be determined at the time of the decision whether and to what extent adverse effects will occur, the decision on the content-related or ancillary provisions and compensations to be determined for this reason shall be reserved for a later procedure.

(6) If the affected person under subsection 3 or subsection 4 could not foresee adverse effects until after the expiry of the period for raising objections, he may demand that the water body user be subsequently subjected to content-related or ancillary provisions. If the adverse effects cannot be avoided or compensated for by subsequent content-related or ancillary provisions, the affected person shall be compensated within the meaning of subsection 3. The application is only permissible within a period of three years from the time the affected person became aware of the adverse effects of the license; it is excluded if 30 years have passed since the state corresponding to the license was established.

§ 16 Exclusion of private-law rights of defense
(1) If a water body use is authorized by an unappealable senior permit, the cessation of the use cannot be demanded on the basis of private-law claims for the defense against adverse effects of the water body use. Only precautions that exclude the adverse effects can be demanded. Insofar as such precautions are not feasible according to the state of the art or are not economically justifiable, only compensation can be demanded.

(2) If a water body use is authorized by an unappealable license, no claims can be asserted on account of adverse effects of the water body use that are directed at the elimination of the disturbance, the cessation of the use, the establishment of precautions, or compensation for damages. Sentence 1 does not exclude claims for damages on account of adverse effects that are based on the water body user not complying with ordered content-related or ancillary provisions.

(3) Subsection 1 and subsection 2 sentence 1 do not apply to private-law claims against the water body user arising from contracts or last wills and testaments and to claims arising from real rights to the property on which the water body use takes place.

§ 17 Authorization of early commencement
(1) In a permit or licensing procedure, the competent authority may, upon application, authorize the commencement of the water body use before the permit or license has been granted, if

a decision in favor of the user can be expected,

a public interest or a legitimate interest of the user exists in the early commencement, and

the user undertakes to compensate for all damages caused by the use up to the decision and, if the use is not permitted or licensed, to restore the former state.

(2) The authorization of early commencement may be revoked at any time. § 13 applies accordingly.

§ 18 Revocation of the permit and the license
(1) The permit is revocable.

(2) The license may be revoked for the reasons stated in § 49 (2) sentence 1 numbers 2 to 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act. The license may also be revoked without compensation in whole or in part if the holder of the license

has not exercised the use for three uninterrupted years or has significantly fallen short of its scope,

has changed the purpose of the use in such a way that it no longer corresponds to the plan (§ 14 (1) number 2).

BGBl. I 2015, 154)

§ 20 Prior rights and prior authorizations
(1) Unless the Länder provide otherwise, no permit or license is required for water body uses based on

rights that have been granted or maintained under the state water acts,

licenses under § 1 (1) sentence 1 of the Ordinance on Simplifications in Water and Water Association Law of 10 February 1945 (RGBl. I p. 29),

a facility approval granted under the Trade Regulation Act,

authorizations that have been granted in a formal procedure under the state water acts and have been equated with the authorizations mentioned in numbers 1 to 3, and

legally regulated plan approval procedures or sovereign acts of dedication for public transport facilities.
Sentence 1 applies only if lawful facilities were in place for the exercise of the use on 12 August 1957, in the territory specified in Article 3 of the Unification Treaty on 1 July 1990, or at another time determined by the Länder.

(2) The rights and authorizations listed in subsection 1 (prior rights and prior authorizations) may be revoked against compensation if a significant impairment of the public good is to be expected from the continuation of the water body use. They may be revoked without compensation, insofar as this was not already permissible under the law applicable before 1 March 2010, if

the use has not been exercised for three uninterrupted years;

the use is no longer necessary for the user to the previously permissible extent; this applies in particular if the permissible extent has been significantly undercut for three years;

the purpose of the use has been changed in such a way that it no longer corresponds to the established purpose;

the user, despite a warning combined with the threat of revocation, has significantly extended the use beyond the scope of the prior right or prior authorization or has not fulfilled conditions or requirements.
For the admissibility of subsequent requirements and measures without compensation, § 13 (2) applies accordingly.

§ 21 Registration of prior rights and prior authorizations
(1) Prior rights and prior authorizations that have not yet been entered in the water book or registered for entry in the water book by 28 February 2010 can be registered with the competent authority for entry in the water book by 1 March 2013. § 32 of the Administrative Procedure Act applies accordingly. Prior rights and prior authorizations that have not been registered in accordance with sentences 1 and 2 shall expire on 1 March 2020, unless the prior right or prior authorization has already expired for other reasons.

(2) Subsection 1 does not apply to prior rights and prior authorizations that were not registered for entry in the water book within the period specified therein following a public notice under § 16 (2) sentence 1 of the Federal Water Act in the version applicable on 28 February 2010. For these prior rights and prior authorizations, § 16 (2) sentences 2 and 3 of the Federal Water Act in the version applicable on 28 February 2010 shall apply.

Section 2
Management of Surface Waters

§ 25 Common use
Every person may use surface waters in a manner and to an extent that is permissible under Land law as common use, provided that the rights of others are not opposed and provided that the owner's or riparian use of others is not impaired. Common use does not include the introduction and discharge of substances into surface waters. The Länder may extend common use to

the harmless discharge of precipitation water,

the introduction of substances into surface waters for fisheries purposes, if no significant adverse effects on the water body status are to be expected as a result.

§ 26 Owner's and riparian use
(1) A permit or a license is not required, unless provided otherwise by Land law, for the use of a surface water body by the owner or a person authorized by the owner for their own needs, if others are not thereby impaired and no adverse change in water quality, no significant reduction in water flow, and no other impairment of the water balance is to be expected. The owner's use does not include the introduction and discharge of substances into surface waters. § 25 sentence 3 applies accordingly.
(2) The owners of properties adjacent to surface waters and the persons entitled to use these properties (riparians) may use surface waters without a permit or license in accordance with subsection 1.
(3) On federal waterways and on other water bodies that serve navigation or are artificially constructed, a use under subsection 2 does not take place.
§ 27 Management objectives for surface waters
(1) Surface waters, insofar as they are not classified as artificial or heavily modified under § 28, shall be managed in such a way that
a deterioration of their ecological and chemical status is prevented and
a good ecological and a good chemical status are maintained or achieved.
(2) Surface waters classified as artificial or heavily modified under § 28 shall be managed in such a way that
a deterioration of their ecological potential and their chemical status is prevented and
a good ecological potential and a good chemical status are maintained or achieved.
§ 28 Classification of artificial and heavily modified water bodies
Surface waters may be classified as artificial or heavily modified water bodies within the meaning of § 3 numbers 4 and 5 if
the changes in the hydromorphological characteristics that would be necessary for achieving good ecological status would have significant adverse effects on
a) the environment as a whole,
b) navigation, including port facilities,
c) recreational activities,
d) purposes of water storage, in particular for drinking water supply, power generation, or irrigation,
e) water regulation, flood protection, or land drainage, or
f) other, equally important sustainable human development activities,
the objectives served by the creation or modification of the water body cannot be achieved with other suitable measures that have significantly less adverse impact on the environment, are technically feasible, and are not associated with disproportionately high costs, and
the achievement of the management objectives set out in §§ 27, 44, and 47 (1) in other water bodies of the same river basin district is not permanently excluded or jeopardized.
§ 29 Deadlines for achieving the management objectives
(1) A good ecological and a good chemical status of surface waters, as well as a good ecological potential and a good chemical status of artificial and heavily modified water bodies, shall be achieved by 22 December 2015. Deviating deadlines may be set by ordinance under § 23 (1) number 1 to implement binding legal acts of the European Union.
(2) The competent authority may extend the deadline under subsection 1 if the status of the water body does not further deteriorate and
the necessary improvements to the water body status cannot be achieved on time due to natural conditions,
the planned measures are only technically feasible in stages over a longer period, or
compliance with the deadline would be associated with disproportionately high costs.
Extensions of deadlines under sentence 1 must not permanently preclude or jeopardize the achievement of the management objectives set out in §§ 27, 44, and 47 (1) in other water bodies of the same river basin district.
(3) Extensions of deadlines under subsection 2 sentence 1 are permissible a maximum of two times for a period of six years each. If the management objectives cannot be achieved within the extensions of deadlines under sentence 1 due to natural conditions, further extensions are possible.
(4) The deadlines under subsections 1 to 3 also apply to water bodies in protected areas within the meaning of Article 6 in conjunction with Annex IV of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (OJ L 327 of 22.12.2000, p. 1), last amended by Directive 2008/105/EC (OJ L 348 of 24.12.2008, p. 84), in its respective applicable version, unless the legal provisions of the European Communities or the European Union, under which the protected areas have been designated, contain other provisions.
§ 30 Deviating management objectives
Notwithstanding § 27, the competent authorities may establish less stringent management objectives for specific surface waters if
the water bodies are so affected by human activity or their natural condition is such that the achievement of the objectives is infeasible or would be associated with disproportionately high costs,
the ecological and socioeconomic needs served by such human activities cannot be met by other measures that would have significantly less adverse impact on the environment and would not be associated with disproportionately high costs,
further deterioration in the status of the water body is prevented, and
taking into account the impacts on the water body properties that are unavoidable due to the nature of the human activities, the best possible ecological status or the best possible ecological potential and the best possible chemical status are achieved.
§ 29 (2) sentence 2 applies accordingly.
§ 31 Exceptions to the management objectives
(1) Temporary deteriorations in the status of a surface water body do not violate the management objectives under §§ 27 and 30 if
they are based on circumstances that
a) are founded on natural causes or force majeure and are exceptional and could not reasonably have been foreseen, or
b) have resulted from accidents,
all practically feasible measures are taken to prevent further deterioration of the water body status and a threat to the achievement of management objectives in other water bodies not affected by these circumstances,
only such measures are taken that do not jeopardize the restoration of the previous water body status after the circumstances have ceased and that are listed in the programme of measures under § 82, and
the effects of the circumstances are reviewed annually and practically feasible measures are taken to restore the previous water body status as soon as possible, subject to the reasons mentioned in § 29 (2) sentence 1 numbers 1 to 3.
(2) If the good ecological status of a surface water body is not achieved or its status deteriorates, this does not violate the management objectives under §§ 27 and 30 if
this is based on a new modification of the physical characteristics of the water body or on changes in the level of groundwater,
the reasons for the modification are of overriding public interest or if the benefits of the new modification for human health or safety or for sustainable development are greater than the benefits that the achievement of the management objectives would have for the environment and the general public,
the objectives pursued with the modification of the water body cannot be achieved with other suitable measures that have significantly less adverse impact on the environment, are technically feasible, and are not associated with disproportionately high costs, and
all practically feasible measures are taken to mitigate the adverse impacts on the water body status.
In the case of new sustainable human development activities within the meaning of § 28 number 1, a deterioration from a very good to a good water body status is also permissible under the conditions set out in sentence 1 numbers 2 to 4.
(3) For exceptions under subsections 1 and 2, § 29 (2) sentence 2 applies accordingly.
§ 32 Keeping surface waters clean
(1) Solid substances may not be introduced into a surface water body for the purpose of their disposal. Sentence 1 does not apply if sediment that has been removed from a water body is introduced into a surface water body.
(2) Substances may only be stored or deposited at a surface water body in such a way that an adverse change in the water quality or water runoff is not to be feared. The same applies to the transport of liquids and gases through pipelines.
§ 33 Minimum water flow
The impoundment of a surface water body or the abstraction or diversion of water from a surface water body is only permissible if the flow rate that is necessary for the water body and other connected water bodies to meet the objectives of § 6 (1) and §§ 27 to 31 is maintained (minimum water flow).
§ 34 Passability of surface waters
(1) The construction, significant modification, and operation of impoundment structures may only be authorized if the passability of the water body is maintained or restored by suitable facilities and operating methods, insofar as this is necessary to achieve the management objectives in accordance with §§ 27 to 31.
(2) If existing impoundment structures do not meet the requirements of subsection 1, the competent authority shall issue the orders for the restoration of passability that are necessary to achieve the management objectives in accordance with §§ 27 to 31.
(3) The Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration shall, for impoundment structures on federal waterways which it has constructed or operates, carry out the measures required under subsections 1 and 2 within the scope of its duties under the Federal Waterways Act in a sovereign capacity.
§ 35 Hydropower use
(1) The use of hydropower may only be authorized if suitable measures for the protection of the fish population are also taken.
(2) If existing hydropower uses do not meet the requirements of subsection 1, the necessary measures shall be carried out within appropriate time limits.
(3) The competent authority shall examine whether, at impoundment sites and other transverse structures that exist on 1 March 2010 and whose removal is not planned even in the long term for the purpose of achieving the management objectives in accordance with §§ 27 to 31, hydropower use is possible according to the site conditions. The result of the examination shall be made accessible to the public in a suitable manner.
§ 36 Structures in, on, over, and under surface waters
(1) Structures in, on, over, and under surface waters shall be constructed, operated, maintained, and decommissioned in such a way that no harmful water body alterations are to be expected and the maintenance of the water body is not made more difficult than is unavoidable under the circumstances. Structures within the meaning of sentence 1 are in particular
structural works such as buildings, bridges, jetties, underpasses, port facilities, and landing stages,
pipelines,
ferries.
In all other respects, the Land law provisions apply.
(2) Impoundment structures and retention dams shall be constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the generally accepted rules of technology; the requirements for flood protection must be observed. Whoever operates impoundment structures and retention dams shall monitor their proper condition and operation at their own expense (self-monitoring). If existing impoundment structures or retention dams do not meet the preceding requirements, the competent authority may order the implementation of the necessary measures within appropriate time limits.
(3) A solar installation may not be constructed and operated
in and over a surface water body that is not an artificial or heavily modified water body, and
in and over an artificial or heavily modified water body, if, starting from the mean water level line,
a) the installation covers more than 15 percent of the water surface area, or
b) the distance to the bank is less than 40 meters.
§ 37 Water discharge
(1) The natural discharge of wild-flowing water onto a lower-lying property may not be obstructed to the detriment of a higher-lying property. The natural discharge of wild-flowing water may not be increased or otherwise altered to the detriment of a lower-lying property.
(2) Owners or persons entitled to use properties on which the natural discharge of wild-flowing water is obstructed to the detriment of a higher-lying property or is increased or otherwise altered to the detriment of a lower-lying property shall tolerate the removal of the obstruction or the incurred alteration by the owners or persons entitled to use the disadvantaged properties. Sentence 1 applies only if those obliged to tolerate have not caused the obstruction, increase, or other alteration of the water discharge and the removal has been announced in advance. The owner of the property on which the obstruction or alteration has arisen may also remove the obstruction or the incurred alteration at their own expense.
(3) For reasons of public good, in particular water management, land cultivation, and public transport, the competent authority may permit deviations from subsections 1 and 2. Insofar as ownership is unreasonably restricted thereby, compensation shall be paid.
(4) Subsections 1 to 3 also apply to wild-flowing water that does not originate from springs.
§ 38 Riparian strips
(1) Riparian strips serve the preservation and improvement of the ecological functions of surface waters, water storage, the securing of water runoff, and the reduction of substance inputs from diffuse sources.
(2) The riparian strip comprises the bank and the area that adjoins the water body on the landward side of the mean water level line. The riparian strip is measured from the mean water level line, and for water bodies with a distinct top of the bank, from the top of the bank.
(3) The riparian strip is five meters wide in the outer area. The competent authority may, for water bodies or sections of water bodies,
abolish riparian strips in the outer area,
establish a different width for the riparian strip in the outer area, deviating from sentence 1,
establish riparian strips of an appropriate width within cohesive built-up areas.
The Länder may enact deviating regulations from sentences 1 and 2.
(4) Owners and persons entitled to use shall maintain riparian strips with regard to their functions under subsection 1. In the riparian strip, the following is prohibited:
the conversion of grassland into arable land,
the removal of site-appropriate trees and shrubs, except for removal as part of proper forestry, and the new planting of non-site-appropriate trees and shrubs,
the handling of substances hazardous to water, except for the application of plant protection products and fertilizers, unless otherwise provided by Land law, and the handling of substances hazardous to water in and in connection with authorized facilities,
the storage, other than temporary, of objects that could obstruct water runoff or be washed away.
Measures that are necessary for hazard prevention are permissible. Sentence 2 numbers 1 and 2 do not apply to measures for water body development and for water body and dike maintenance.
(5) The competent authority may grant a revocable exemption from a prohibition under subsection 4 sentence 2 if overriding reasons of public good require the measure or if the prohibition would lead to undue hardship in an individual case. The exemption may also be subsequently provided with ancillary provisions for reasons of public good, in particular to ensure that the riparian strip fulfills the functions mentioned in subsection 1. For the granting of the exemption, § 11a (4) and (5) apply accordingly if the exemption is required for a project for the generation of energy from renewable sources.

§ 38a Agriculturally used areas with slope inclination adjoining water bodies
(1) Owners and persons entitled to use shall, on agriculturally used areas that adjoin water bodies and have an average slope of at least 5 percent towards the water body within a distance of 20 meters to the top of the bank, establish and maintain a closed, year-round green plant cover within a distance of 5 meters landward to the top of the bank of the water body. For water bodies without a distinct top of the bank, the mean water level line is decisive. Tillage for the renewal of the plant cover may be carried out once within five-year periods. The first five-year period begins at the end of 30 June 2020.

(2) Further legal provisions of the Länder remain unaffected. Notwithstanding subsection 1 sentences 1 and 2, the mean water level line applies if the Land law provides for this reference point and harmful water body alterations are avoided.

§ 39 Water body maintenance
(1) The maintenance of a surface water body comprises its care and development as a public-law obligation (maintenance obligation). Water body maintenance includes in particular:

the maintenance of the water body bed, also to secure proper water runoff,

the maintenance of the banks, in particular by maintaining and newly planting site-appropriate bank vegetation, and keeping the banks clear for water runoff,

the maintenance of the navigability of navigable waters, with the exception of special approaches to ports and ship landing stages,

the maintenance and promotion of the ecological functionality of the water body, in particular as a habitat for wild animals and plants,

the maintenance of the water body in a state that meets the water management needs with regard to the discharge or retention of water, sediment, suspended solids, and ice.

(2) Water body maintenance must be aligned with the management objectives in accordance with §§ 27 to 31 and must not jeopardize the achievement of these objectives. It must meet the requirements placed on water body maintenance in the programme of measures under § 82. In maintenance, the preservation of the efficiency and functionality of the natural environment must be taken into account; the visual and recreational value of the water landscape must be considered.

(3) Subsections 1 and 2 also apply to the maintenance of developed water bodies, unless otherwise determined in a plan approval decision or a plan permission under § 68.

§ 40 Bearer of the maintenance obligation
(1) The maintenance of surface waters is the responsibility of the owners of the water bodies, unless it is the task of territorial authorities, water and soil associations, municipal special-purpose associations, or other public-law corporations under Land law provisions. If the water body owner is the bearer of the maintenance obligation, the riparians and those owners of properties and facilities who benefit from the maintenance or make the maintenance more difficult are obliged to contribute to the costs of maintenance. If a corporation under sentence 1 is obliged to maintain, the Länder may determine the extent to which the water body owners, the persons mentioned in sentence 2, other persons who benefit from the maintenance, or other owners of properties in the catchment area are obliged to contribute to the costs of maintenance.

(2) The maintenance obligation may be transferred to a third party with the consent of the competent authority.

(3) If an obstruction to water runoff or navigation or another impairment that makes maintenance measures under § 39 necessary has been caused by a person other than the one obliged to maintain, the competent authority shall oblige the other person to remove it. If the person obliged to maintain has removed the obstruction or the other impairment, the other person shall reimburse them for the costs, provided the work was necessary and the costs were reasonable.

(4) If the bearer of the maintenance obligation does not fulfill their obligations, the necessary maintenance work shall be carried out at their expense by the Land or, if Land law so provides, by another public-law corporation within the meaning of subsection 1 sentence 1. Sentence 1 does not apply if a public-law corporation is the bearer of the maintenance obligation.

Section 3
Management of Coastal Waters

§ 43 Uses of coastal waters not requiring a permit
The Länder may determine that a permit is not required

for the discharge of groundwater, spring water, and precipitation water into a coastal water body,

for the introduction and discharge of other substances into a coastal water body if no significant adverse changes in its properties are to be expected as a result.

§ 44 Management objectives for coastal waters
For coastal waters under § 7 (5) sentence 2, §§ 27 to 31 apply accordingly. Seawards of the line mentioned in § 7 (5) sentence 2, §§ 27 to 31 apply accordingly in coastal waters, insofar as a good chemical status is to be achieved.

§ 45 Keeping coastal waters clean
(1) Solid substances may not be introduced into a coastal water body for the purpose of their disposal. Sentence 1 does not apply if sediment that has been removed from a water body is introduced into a coastal water body.

(2) In procedures for the granting of permits for the introduction or discharge of substances into coastal waters in the context of marine geo-engineering, the provisions of § 3 (5), § 5 (3) and (4) sentence 2, § 5a and the appendix to § 4 sentence 2 number 3 of the High Seas Dumping Act of 25 August 1998 (BGBl. I p. 2455), last amended by Article 1 of the Act of 4 December 2018 (BGBl. I p. 2254), as well as the provisions of the ordinance issued on the basis of § 9 sentence 1 number 1 and sentence 2 of the High Seas Dumping Act, apply accordingly.

(3) Substances may only be stored or deposited at a coastal water body in such a way that an adverse change in the water quality is not to be feared. The same applies to the transport of liquids and gases through pipelines.

Section 3a
Management of Marine Waters

§ 45a Management objectives for marine waters
(1) Marine waters shall be managed in such a way that

a deterioration of their status is prevented and

a good status is maintained or achieved by 31 December 2020 at the latest.

(2) In order to achieve the management objectives under subsection 1, it is necessary in particular

to protect and preserve marine ecosystems and, in areas where they have been damaged, to restore them,

to progressively prevent and reduce inputs of substances and energy, including noise, caused by humans into the marine waters with the aim of excluding significant adverse effects on marine ecosystems, biological diversity, human health, and the permissible use of the sea, and

to preserve or create existing and future opportunities for the sustainable use of the sea.

(3) The North Sea and the Baltic Sea shall each be managed separately in accordance with the provisions of this section.

§ 45b Status of marine waters
(1) The status of marine waters is the status of the environment in marine waters, taking into account

the structure, function, and processes of the individual marine ecosystems,

the natural physiographic, geographical, biological, geological, and climatic factors, as well as

the physical, acoustic, and chemical conditions, including the conditions that arise as a result of human action in the area concerned and outside it.

(2) Good status of marine waters is the status of the environment in marine waters which, taking into account their respective particularities, are ecologically diverse, dynamic, unpolluted, healthy, and productive, and which are used sustainably, whereby

the individual marine ecosystems function without restriction and are resilient to human-induced environmental changes, and the different biological components of the marine ecosystems are in balance,

the species living in the sea and their habitats are protected, and a human-induced decline in biological diversity is prevented, and

human-induced inputs of substances and energy, including noise, into the marine environment have no adverse effects on marine ecosystems, biological diversity, human health, and the permissible use of the sea.

§ 45c Initial assessment
(1) The competent authorities shall assess the marine waters by 15 July 2012 in accordance with Annex III of Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) (OJ L 164 of 25.6.2008, p. 19) in its respective applicable version. The assessment comprises

the essential properties and characteristics of the marine waters and their current status,

the most significant pressures and their impacts, including human action, on the status of the marine waters, taking into account the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the various pressures, identifiable trends, and the most important cumulative and synergistic effects, and

an economic and social analysis of the use of the marine waters and of the costs of a deterioration of their status.

(2) In the assessment under subsection 1, the competent authorities shall take into account other relevant assessments, in particular within the framework of international marine conventions and on the basis of § 6 in conjunction with § 56 of the Federal Nature Conservation Act. In the assessment under subsection 1, the following measures, which have been taken in connection with the management of coastal waters and transitional waters in accordance with § 44 or §§ 27 to 31, shall also be largely taken into account:

classifications of the ecological and chemical status of coastal waters and transitional waters, as well as

lists of the pressures on coastal waters and transitional waters and assessments of their impacts.

§ 45d Description of the good status of marine waters
On the basis of the initial assessment under § 45c, the competent authorities shall, by 15 July 2012, describe the characteristics for the good status of marine waters in accordance with Annex I of Directive 2008/56/EC in its respective applicable version. In this context, determinations of type-specific reference conditions for coastal waters, which correspond to the very good ecological status or the highest ecological potential and which have been made in connection with the management of coastal waters in accordance with § 44, shall be largely taken into account. Determinations of criteria for a favourable conservation status of the natural habitat types listed in Annex I of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (OJ L 206 of 22.7.1992, p. 7), last amended by Directive 2006/105/EC (OJ L 363 of 20.12.2006, p. 368), and of the animal and plant species listed in Annex II of that Directive, which occur in the marine waters, shall also be largely taken into account.

§ 45e Establishment of objectives
On the basis of the initial assessment under § 45c, the competent authorities shall, by 15 July 2012, establish the intermediate objectives with deadlines and the individual objectives that are necessary to achieve a good status of the marine waters, as well as associated indicators, in accordance with Annex IV of Directive 2008/56/EC in its respective applicable version. In doing so, other relevant objectives that have been established for the waters at the national, Community, or international level shall be taken into account, including the management objectives in accordance with § 44 and the conservation objectives within the meaning of § 7 (1) number 9 of the Federal Nature Conservation Act. The competent authorities shall ensure that the objectives are compatible with each other.

§ 45f Monitoring programmes
(1) By 15 July 2014, the competent authorities shall, on the basis of the initial assessment under § 45c and taking into account the requirements of Annex V of Directive 2008/56/EC in its respective applicable version, establish monitoring programmes for the ongoing determination, description, and assessment of the status of the marine waters and for the regular assessment and updating of the objectives established under § 45e sentence 1, and shall implement them.

(2) The monitoring programmes must be compatible with other monitoring requirements for the protection of the sea, which exist in particular under water or nature conservation law provisions as well as international marine conventions. Programmes for monitoring the ecological and chemical status of coastal waters, which have been established in connection with the management of coastal waters in accordance with § 44, shall be largely taken into account in the establishment and implementation of the monitoring programmes.

§ 45g Extension of deadlines; exceptions from management objectives
(1) The competent authority may extend the deadline under § 45a (1) number 2 as well as deadlines for objectives established under § 45e sentence 1, insofar as it is impossible for certain parts of the marine waters to achieve the objectives on time due to natural conditions. In its decision, it shall take into account the effects on the marine waters of other states as well as on the high seas.

(2) The competent authority may permit exceptions with regard to the achievement of the good status under § 45a (1) number 2 or with regard to the objectives established under § 45e sentence 1 for certain parts of the marine waters. Exceptions are only permissible if the objectives under sentence 1 cannot be achieved on account of

actions or omissions outside the scope of this Act,

natural causes,

force majeure, or

changes in the physical properties of the marine water body through measures for reasons of public good, provided that the benefits of the measures outweigh the adverse environmental impacts.
Subsection 1 sentence 2 applies accordingly. In the cases of sentence 2 number 4, it must be ensured that the achievement of the good status of the marine waters, including the marine waters of other Member States of the European Union, is not permanently prevented or made more difficult.

(3) If the competent authority extends a deadline under subsection 1 sentence 1 or permits exceptions under subsection 2, it shall take measures aimed at

continuing to pursue the objectives established under § 45e sentence 1,

preventing a further deterioration of the status of the marine water body in the cases of subsection 2 sentence 1 numbers 2 to 4, and

mitigating adverse effects on the status of the marine waters, including the marine waters of other states as well as the high seas.

§ 45h Programmes of measures
(1) On the basis of the initial assessment under § 45c (1) and the objectives established under § 45e sentence 1, programmes of measures shall be established by 31 December 2015, which take into account the principle of sustainable development. The programmes of measures shall comprise the cost-effective measures that are necessary to achieve or maintain the good status of the marine waters. In doing so, the types of measures listed in Annex VI of Directive 2008/56/EC in its respective applicable version shall be taken into account. The programmes of measures also contain

spatial protection measures within the meaning of § 56 (2) of the Federal Nature Conservation Act,

an explanation of how the established measures contribute to the achievement of the objectives established under § 45e sentence 1,

where applicable, extensions of deadlines under § 45g (1) and exceptions under § 45g (2), including a justification,

where applicable, measures under § 45g (3), and

measures under Articles 4 to 10 of Directive (EU) 2019/904 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment (OJ L 155 of 12.6.2019, p. 1).
By 31 December 2013, information on the areas mentioned in sentence 4 number 1 and in Article 13 (5) of Directive 2008/56/EC shall be published.

(2) Before the establishment and updating of the programmes of measures, impact assessments, including cost-benefit analyses, shall be carried out for the proposed new measures.

(3) In the establishment of the programmes of measures, measures for the protection of the sea under other water and nature conservation law provisions, including international marine conventions, shall be taken into account. In the establishment and implementation of the programmes of measures under subsection 1, measures that have been included in a programme of measures under § 82

for a coastal water body, or

for a surface water body, insofar as the measures serve the protection of a coastal water body,
shall be largely taken into account.
The measures should contribute to the marine waters of other Member States of the European Union achieving a good status; adverse effects on these waters should be avoided.

(4) The measures listed in the programmes of measures may not contain any restriction on activities that serve defense purposes alone. However, these activities shall be carried out in such a way that they are, as far as possible, compatible with the objectives established under § 45e sentence 1.

(5) The competent authority shall implement the measures listed in the programme of measures by 31 December 2016.

(6) The competent authority shall, notwithstanding subsection 1 sentence 1 and subsection 5, set an earlier date for the establishment and implementation of the programmes of measures if the status of the marine water body requires immediate cross-border measures. In this case, additional or more extensive measures beyond those already contained in an established programme of measures may also be determined. Subsection 3 applies accordingly.

§ 45i Public participation
(1) The competent authority shall publish

summaries of the drafts of
a) the initial assessment under § 45c (1), the description of the good status under § 45d sentence 1, and the objectives under § 45e sentence 1 by 15 October 2011,
b) the monitoring programmes under § 45f (1) by 15 October 2013,
and

drafts of the programmes of measures under § 45h (1) by 31 March 2015.
Within six months of publication, the public may submit comments on the documents mentioned in sentence 1 to the competent authority in writing or electronically; this shall be indicated in the publication. For programmes of measures under § 45h, the participation of the public under sentences 1 and 2 is part of the strategic environmental assessment under § 42 of the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment.

(2) For updates under § 45j and the early establishment of a programme of measures under § 45h (6), subsection 1 applies accordingly.

(3) Documents under subsection 1 sentence 1, which relate to the area of the German exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf, shall be published in the Federal Gazette, including in the cases of subsection 2.

(4) § 85 applies accordingly to the measures referred to in subsection 1 sentence 1.

§ 45j Review and updating
The initial assessment under § 45c (1), the description of the good status of the marine waters under § 45d sentence 1, the objectives established under § 45e sentence 1, the monitoring programmes under § 45f (1), and the programmes of measures under § 45h (1) shall be reviewed every six years and, where necessary, updated.

§ 45k Coordination
(1) To achieve the management objectives under § 45a, the competent authorities, including the competent authorities of the affected inland Länder, shall coordinate the measures under §§ 45c to 45h both among themselves and with the competent authorities in the area of the German exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf, as well as with the competent authorities of other Member States of the European Union. The competent authorities shall seek coordination corresponding to sentence 1 with the competent authorities of states that are not members of the European Union. The competent authorities should use the organizational units of international marine conventions and international river basin conventions. For coordination under sentences 1 to 3, § 7 (4) sentence 2 applies accordingly.

(2) If other Member States of the European Union take measures under Directive 2008/56/EC, the competent authorities shall also cooperate in this, insofar as these measures are related to the fact that the surface runoff of a river basin district flows into the marine water for which the measures are taken. Subsection 1 sentences 2 to 4 apply accordingly.

§ 45l Competence in the area of the German exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf
The Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection is authorized, in agreement with the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport, and the Federal Ministry of Finance, to regulate by ordinance without the consent of the Bundesrat the competence of federal authorities within the business area of the said federal ministries for the implementation of the provisions of this section and of the provisions issued for marine waters on the basis of § 23 in the area of the German exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf, as well as the cooperation of federal authorities in the implementation of these provisions in this area.

Section 4
Management of Groundwater

§ 46 Permit-free uses of groundwater
(1) No permit or license is required for the abstraction, bringing to the surface, conveyance to the surface, or diversion of groundwater

for the household, for the agricultural farm operation, for watering livestock outside the farm operation, or in small quantities for a temporary purpose,

for the purposes of ordinary land drainage of agriculturally, forestry, or horticulturally used properties,
provided that no significant adverse effects on the water balance are to be feared. If, in the cases and under the conditions of sentence 1 number 2, the water from the land drainage is discharged into a surface water body, § 25 sentence 2 does not apply.

(2) Furthermore, no permit is required for the discharge of precipitation water into the groundwater by harmless infiltration, insofar as this is determined in an ordinance under § 23 (1).

(3) It may be determined by Land law that further cases are exempted from the permit or license requirement or that a permit or a license is required in the cases of subsections 1 and 2.

§ 47 Management objectives for groundwater
(1) Groundwater shall be managed in such a way that

a deterioration of its quantitative and chemical status is prevented;

all significant and sustained upward trends in pollutant concentrations due to the impacts of human activity are reversed;

a good quantitative and a good chemical status are maintained or achieved; a good quantitative status includes in particular a balance between groundwater abstraction and groundwater recharge.

(2) The management objectives under subsection 1 number 3 shall be achieved by 22 December 2015. Extensions of deadlines are permissible in analogous application of § 29 (2) to (4).

(3) For exceptions to the management objectives under subsection 1, § 31 (1), (2) sentence 1, and (3) apply accordingly. For the management objectives under subsection 1 number 3, § 30 also applies accordingly with the proviso that under sentence 1 number 4, the best possible quantitative and chemical status of the groundwater is to be achieved.

§ 48 Keeping groundwater clean
(1) A permit for the introduction and discharge of substances into the groundwater may only be granted if an adverse change in the water quality is not to be feared. It may also be stipulated by ordinance under § 23 (1) number 3 under which conditions the requirement of sentence 1 is considered to be met, particularly with regard to limiting the entry of pollutants. The ordinance requires the consent of the Bundestag. Consent shall be deemed to have been given if the Bundestag has not refused its consent within three session weeks of receipt of the Federal Government's proposal.

(2) Substances may only be stored or deposited in such a way that an adverse change in the groundwater quality is not to be feared. The same applies to the transport of liquids and gases through pipelines. Subsection 1 sentences 2 to 4 apply accordingly.

§ 49 Earthworks
(1) Works that penetrate the ground so deeply that they can have a direct or indirect effect on the movement, level, or quality of the groundwater must be reported to the competent authority one month before the works begin. If substances are introduced into the groundwater during these works, a permit is required, notwithstanding § 8 (1) in conjunction with § 9 (1) number 4, instead of the report only if the introduction can have an adverse effect on the groundwater quality. The competent authority may specify the depth according to sentence 1 in more detail for certain areas.

(2) If groundwater is unintentionally tapped, this must be reported to the competent authority without delay.

(3) In the cases of subsections 1 and 2, the competent authority shall order the cessation or removal of the tapping if an adverse change in the groundwater quality is to be feared or has occurred and the damage cannot be otherwise avoided or compensated for; the competent authority shall order the necessary measures. Sentence 1 applies accordingly if groundwater is tapped without authorization.

(4) Deviating regulations may be made by Land law.

Chapter 3
Special Water Management Provisions

Section 1
Public Water Supply, Water Protection Areas, Protection of Curative Springs

§ 50 Public water supply; authorization to issue ordinances
(1) The water supply serving the general public (public water supply) is a task of public service provision. This also includes providing drinking water from the mains network in public places through indoor and outdoor facilities, insofar as this is technically feasible and proportionate, taking into account the need and local circumstances, such as climate and geography.

(2) The water demand of the public water supply is to be met primarily from local water resources, provided that overriding reasons of public good do not conflict with this. The demand may, in particular, be met with water from distant water resources if a supply from local water resources cannot be ensured in sufficient quantity or quality or at a reasonable cost.

(3) The operators of the public water supply shall promote the careful use of water. In particular, they shall keep water losses in their facilities low and inform end consumers about measures to save water, taking into account hygienic requirements.

(4) Water abstraction facilities may only be constructed, maintained, and operated in accordance with the generally accepted rules of technology.

(4a) The Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection shall issue ordinances with the consent of the Bundesrat on

the assessment of catchment areas of abstraction points for drinking water supply and on risk management for such catchment areas, including in each case the regulation of
a) duties of the operators of water abstraction facilities, of the authorities, of causers and potential causers of water body pollution, as well as of property owners and holders of actual control over properties,
b) powers of the competent authority to order specific measures against the operators of water abstraction facilities, causers and potential causers of water body pollution, as well as property owners and holders of actual control over properties,

the requirements for the professional competence of persons who carry out the assessment and risk management,

the official procedures for assessment and risk management, including the documentation and reporting obligations incumbent upon authorities and operators of water abstraction facilities, as well as the obligations for the procurement and transmission of information,

the requirements for testing laboratories that examine raw water, surface water, and groundwater, as well as requirements for the testing procedures,

the requirements for programmes of measures and management plans in connection with risk management under number 1.
The assessment under sentence 1 number 1 comprises in particular

the determination and more detailed description of catchment areas of abstraction points for drinking water supply, including map representations and georeferencing,

the recording and assessment of hazards to human health and drinking water supply, and

the monitoring and investigation of surface water, groundwater, and raw water.
The risk management under sentence 1 number 1 comprises in particular precautionary, risk-mitigating, monitoring, and investigation measures, other measures for risk control, as well as the examination of the necessity to designate or adapt protection areas.

(5) By ordinance of the state government or by decision of the competent authority, operators of the public water supply may be obliged, beyond the obligations in an ordinance under subsection 4a, to carry out at their own expense further investigations into the quality of the water obtained or obtainable for the purposes of public water supply or to have them carried out by a body designated by them. In particular, the type, scope, and frequency of the investigations, as well as the transmission of the investigation results, may be regulated in more detail. The state government may delegate the authorization under sentence 1 to other state authorities by ordinance.

§ 51 Designation of water protection areas
(1) Insofar as the public good requires it, in order to

protect water bodies in the interest of the current or future public water supply from adverse effects,

recharge the groundwater, or

prevent the harmful runoff of precipitation water as well as the washing away and entry of soil constituents, fertilizers, or plant protection products into water bodies,
the state government may designate water protection areas by ordinance. The beneficiary shall be named in the ordinance. The state government may delegate the authorization under sentence 1 to other state authorities by ordinance.

(2) Drinking water protection areas should be divided into zones with different protection provisions in accordance with the generally accepted rules of technology.

§ 52 Special requirements in water protection areas
(1) In the ordinance under § 51 (1) or by official decision, certain actions may be prohibited or declared permissible only to a limited extent in water protection areas, insofar as the protective purpose so requires, and owners and persons entitled to use properties may be obliged to

carry out certain actions related to the property, in particular to use the properties only in a certain way,

prepare and keep records of the management of the properties and to present them to the competent authority upon request,

tolerate certain measures, in particular the observation of the water body and the soil, the monitoring of protection provisions, the erection of fences, as well as markings, plantings, and afforestations,
and beneficiaries may be obliged to carry out the measures to be tolerated under number 2 letter c.
The competent authority may grant an exemption from prohibitions, restrictions, and obligations of toleration and action under sentence 1 if the protective purpose is not endangered or if overriding reasons of public good so require. It shall grant an exemption insofar as this is necessary to avoid unreasonable restrictions of ownership and the protective purpose is not thereby endangered. For the granting of the exemption, § 11a (4) and (5) apply accordingly if the exemption is required for a project for the generation of energy from renewable sources.

(2) In an area designated as a water protection area, provisional orders under subsection 1 may be issued if the purpose pursued with the designation of the water protection area would otherwise be endangered. The provisional order shall cease to be in force upon the entry into force of the ordinance under § 51 (1), at the latest after three years. If special circumstances so require, the period may be extended by a maximum of one further year. The provisional order shall be repealed before the expiry of the period under sentence 2 or sentence 3 as soon as and to the extent that the prerequisites for its issuance have ceased to exist.

(3) Official decisions under subsection 1 may also be made outside a water protection area if the purpose pursued with the designation of the water protection area would otherwise be endangered.

(4) Insofar as an order under subsection 1 sentence 1 number 1 or number 2, also in conjunction with subsection 2 or subsection 3, unreasonably restricts ownership and this restriction cannot be avoided or compensated for by an exemption under subsection 1 sentence 3 or other measures, compensation shall be paid.

(5) If an order under subsection 1 sentence 1 number 1 or number 2, also in conjunction with subsection 2 or subsection 3, establishes increased requirements that restrict the proper agricultural or forestry use of a property, appropriate indemnification shall be paid for the economic disadvantages thereby caused, unless a compensation obligation exists under subsection 4.

Section 2
Wastewater Disposal

§ 54 Definitions for wastewater disposal
(1) Wastewater is

water altered in its properties by domestic, commercial, agricultural, or other use and the water flowing off with it in dry weather (polluted water), as well as

water flowing off from precipitation collected from the area of built-up or paved surfaces (precipitation water).
Liquids emerging from and collected from facilities for treating, storing, and depositing waste are also considered polluted water.

(2) Wastewater disposal comprises the collection, conveyance, treatment, discharge, infiltration, spraying, and irrigation of wastewater, as well as the dewatering of sewage sludge in connection with wastewater disposal. Wastewater disposal also includes the removal of sludge accumulating in small-scale sewage treatment plants.

(3) BREF document is a document drawn up on the basis of the exchange of information under Article 13 of Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) (recast) (OJ L 334 of 17.12.2010, p. 17) for specific activities, which describes in particular the applied techniques, the current emission and consumption levels, and the techniques considered for the determination of the best available techniques as well as the BAT conclusions.

(4) BAT conclusions are a document adopted by the European Commission under Article 13 (5) of Directive 2010/75/EU, containing the parts of a BREF document with the conclusions on

the best available techniques, their description, and information to assess their applicability,

the emission levels associated with the best available techniques,

the monitoring measures associated with numbers 1 and 2,

the consumption levels associated with numbers 1 and 2, and

where appropriate, relevant site remediation measures.

(5) Emission limit values are the emission levels associated with the best available techniques.

(6) The emission levels associated with the best available techniques are the range of emission levels obtained under normal operating conditions using a best available technique or a combination of best available techniques as described in the BAT conclusions, expressed as an average over a given period of time, under specified reference conditions.

§ 55 Principles of wastewater disposal
(1) Wastewater shall be disposed of in such a way that the public good is not impaired. The disposal of domestic wastewater by decentralized facilities may also serve the public good.

(2) Precipitation water should be infiltrated or irrigated locally or discharged directly or via a sewer system without mixing with polluted water into a water body, provided that neither water law nor other public-law provisions nor water management interests oppose this.

(3) Liquid substances that are not wastewater may be disposed of with wastewater if such disposal of the substances is more environmentally compatible than disposal as waste and water management interests do not oppose it.

§ 56 Duty of wastewater disposal
Wastewater is to be disposed of by the legal persons under public law who are obliged to do so under Land law (persons obliged to dispose of wastewater). The Länder may determine under which conditions wastewater disposal is incumbent upon persons obliged to dispose of wastewater other than those mentioned in sentence 1. The persons obliged to dispose of wastewater may use third parties to fulfill their duties.

§ 57 Discharge of wastewater into water bodies
(1) A permit for the discharge of wastewater into water bodies (direct discharge) may only be granted if

the quantity and harmfulness of the wastewater are kept as low as is possible by complying with the procedures applicable in each case according to the state of the art,

the discharge is compatible with the requirements for the properties of the water body and other legal requirements, and

wastewater facilities or other installations are constructed and operated that are necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements under numbers 1 and 2.

(2) By ordinance under § 23 (1) number 3, requirements may be established for the discharge of wastewater into water bodies that correspond to the state of the art under subsection 1 number 1. The requirements may also be established for the point where the wastewater arises or before it is mixed.

(3) After the publication of a BAT conclusion, it shall be ensured without delay when establishing requirements under subsection 2 sentence 1 that for facilities under § 3 of the Ordinance on Installations Requiring a Permit and under § 60 (3) sentence 1 number 2, the discharges under normal operating conditions do not exceed the emission limit values specified in the BAT conclusions. If, in special cases, compliance with the emission limit values mentioned in sentence 1 would be disproportionate due to the technical characteristics of the type of facility concerned, appropriate emission values may be established in the ordinance for the type of facility, which otherwise correspond to the state of the art. When establishing the deviating requirements under sentence 2, it must be ensured that the emission limit values specified in Annexes V to VIII of Directive 2010/75/EU are not exceeded, no significant adverse effects on the water body status are caused, and a high level of protection for the environment as a whole is contributed to. The necessity of deviating requirements must be justified.

(4) For existing wastewater discharges from facilities under § 3 of the Ordinance on Installations Requiring a Permit or for facilities under § 60 (3) sentence 1 number 2, it is necessary to

review and, if necessary, adapt the ordinance within one year of the publication of BAT conclusions for the main activity, and

ensure within four years of the publication of BAT conclusions for the main activity that the discharges or facilities concerned comply with the emission limit values of the ordinance; in this context, the emission limit values are considered to be established in the discharge decision, unless the decision establishes more extensive requirements in individual cases.
Should the adaptation of the wastewater discharge to the requirements amended under sentence 1 number 1 be disproportionate within the period specified in sentence 1 due to the technical characteristics of the facility concerned, the competent authority shall establish a longer period.

(5) If existing discharges that do not fall under subsections 3 to 4 do not meet the requirements of subsection 2, also in conjunction with sentence 2, or corresponding requirements of the Wastewater Ordinance in its version applicable on 28 February 2010, the operator shall carry out the necessary adaptation measures within appropriate time limits; subsection 4 sentence 1 number 2 second half-sentence applies accordingly. For discharges under sentence 1, deviating requirements shall be established in the ordinance under subsection 2 sentence 1, insofar as the necessary adaptation measures would be disproportionate.

§ 58 Discharge of wastewater into public wastewater facilities
(1) The discharge of wastewater into public wastewater facilities (indirect discharge) requires a permit from the competent authority, insofar as the Wastewater Ordinance, in its respective applicable version, establishes requirements for the wastewater at the point where it arises or before it is mixed. It may be determined by ordinance under § 23 (1) numbers 5, 8, and 10,

under which conditions the indirect discharge requires only a notification instead of a permit under sentence 1,

that compliance with the requirements under subsection 2 is also monitored by experts.
Further legal provisions of the Länder that correspond to the provisions of sentence 2 or that provide for permit requirements exceeding sentence 1 or sentence 2 remain unaffected. Also unaffected are legal provisions of the Länder according to which the permit of the competent authority is replaced by a permit from the operator of a public wastewater facility.

(2) A permit for an indirect discharge may only be granted if

the requirements applicable to the discharge under the Wastewater Ordinance in its respective applicable version, including the general requirements, are met,

the fulfillment of the requirements for direct discharge is not jeopardized, and

wastewater facilities or other installations are constructed and operated that are necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements under numbers 1 and 2.

(3) If existing indirect discharges do not meet the requirements of subsection 2, the necessary measures shall be carried out within appropriate time limits.

(4) § 13 (1) and § 17 apply accordingly. A permit may also be granted subject to revocation.

§ 59 Discharge of wastewater into private wastewater facilities
(1) The discharge of wastewater into public wastewater facilities is equivalent to the discharge of wastewater by third parties into private wastewater facilities that serve the disposal of commercial wastewater.

(2) The competent authority may exempt wastewater discharges under subsection 1 from the permit requirement under subsection 1 in conjunction with § 58 (1) if contractual agreements between the operator of the private wastewater facility and the discharger ensure compliance with the requirements of § 58 (2).

§ 60 Wastewater facilities
(1) Wastewater facilities shall be constructed, operated, and maintained in such a way that the requirements for wastewater disposal are met. In all other respects, wastewater treatment plants within the meaning of subsection 3 sentence 1 numbers 2 and 3 must be constructed, operated, and maintained according to the state of the art, and other wastewater facilities according to the generally accepted rules of technology.

(2) If existing wastewater facilities do not meet the requirements of subsection 1, the necessary measures shall be carried out within appropriate time limits.

(3) The construction, operation, and significant modification of a wastewater treatment plant require a permit if

the facility is subject to an obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment under the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment, or

the facility treats wastewater that
a) originates from facilities under § 3 of the Ordinance on Installations Requiring a Permit, the permit requirement of which does not extend to the wastewater treatment plant under § 1 (2) of the Ordinance on Installations Requiring a Permit, and
b) does not fall under Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste-water treatment (OJ L 135 of 30.5.1991, p. 40), last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1137/2008 (OJ L 311 of 21.11.2008, p. 1), or

the facility treats wastewater that
a) originates from a landfill within the meaning of § 3 (27) of the Circular Economy Act with a reception capacity of at least 10 tonnes per day or with a total capacity of at least 25,000 tonnes, excluding landfills for inert waste, provided the authorization of the landfill does not extend to the facility, and
b) does not fall under Directive 91/271/EEC.
The permit shall be refused or granted with the necessary ancillary provisions if the facility does not meet the requirements of subsection 1 or if other public-law provisions so require. § 13 (1), § 16 (1) and (3), and § 17 apply accordingly. For facilities that meet the conditions of sentence 1 number 2 or number 3, the requirements of § 5 of the Federal Immission Control Act also apply accordingly.

(4) If a permit is not applied for, the operator must notify the competent authority in writing or electronically of the change in the location, quality, or operation of a facility that meets the conditions of subsection 3 sentence 1 number 2 or number 3 at least one month before the change is to begin, if the change may have an impact on the environment. The notification must be accompanied by the documents necessary to assess the effects under § 3 (1) and (2) of the Industrial Sewage Treatment Plant Admission and Monitoring Ordinance, insofar as these may be required for the examination of whether the project requires a permit. The competent authority shall immediately inform the operator whether it has received the documents required for the examination under sentence 2. The operator of the facility may carry out the change as soon as the competent authority has informed them that the change does not require a permit or if the competent authority has not responded within one month of receiving the notification under sentence 3 that the required documents are available.

(5) If the operator of a facility that meets the conditions of subsection 3 sentence 1 number 2 or number 3 fails to comply with an ancillary provision or a finally determined obligation from an ordinance under § 23 (1) number 3 in conjunction with § 57 (2), (3), (4) sentence 1 number 1 or (5) sentence 2, under § 23 (1) number 5, or the Wastewater Ordinance in its version applicable on 28 February 2010, and an immediate danger to human health or the environment is thereby caused, the competent authority shall prohibit the operation of the facility or the operation of the relevant part of the facility until the ancillary provision or the finally determined obligation is fulfilled.

(6) If a facility that meets the conditions of subsection 3 sentence 1 number 2 or number 3 is operated or significantly modified without the required permit, the competent authority shall order the decommissioning of the facility.

(7) The Länder may regulate that the construction, operation, and significant modification of wastewater facilities that do not fall under subsection 3 require a notification or permit. Permit requirements under other public-law provisions remain unaffected.

§ 61 Self-monitoring for wastewater discharges and wastewater facilities
(1) Anyone who discharges wastewater into a water body or into a wastewater facility is obliged to have the wastewater examined by qualified personnel or by a suitable body (self-monitoring) in accordance with an ordinance under subsection 3 or the official decision authorizing the wastewater discharge.

(2) Anyone who operates a wastewater facility is obliged to monitor its condition, its functionality, its maintenance, and its operation, as well as the type and quantity of wastewater and its constituents, themselves. They shall make records of this in accordance with an ordinance under subsection 3, keep them, and present them to the competent authority upon request.

(3) By ordinance under § 23 (1) numbers 8, 9, and 11, regulations may be made in particular concerning the determination of the wastewater quantity, the frequency and performance of sampling, measurements, and analyses, including quality assurance, recording and retention obligations, as well as the conditions under which no obligation for self-monitoring exists.

Section 3
Handling of Substances Hazardous to Water

§ 62 Requirements for handling substances hazardous to water
(1) Facilities for storing, filling, manufacturing, and treating substances hazardous to water, as well as facilities for using substances hazardous to water in the commercial sector and in the area of public institutions, must be of such a nature and be constructed, maintained, operated, and decommissioned in such a way that an adverse change in the properties of water bodies is not to be feared. The same applies to pipeline installations that

do not extend beyond the area of a plant site,

are accessories to a facility for handling substances hazardous to water, or

connect facilities that are in close spatial and operational proximity to one another.
For facilities for transshipping substances hazardous to water and for storing and filling liquid manure, slurry, and silage effluent, as well as comparable substances arising in agriculture, sentence 1 applies accordingly with the proviso that the best possible protection of the water bodies from adverse changes in their properties is achieved.

(2) Facilities within the meaning of subsection 1 may only be of such a nature and be constructed, maintained, operated, and decommissioned in accordance with the generally accepted rules of technology.

(3) Substances hazardous to water within the meaning of this section are solid, liquid, and gaseous substances that are capable of causing permanent or not merely insignificant adverse changes in the quality of water.

(4) More detailed regulations may be issued by ordinance under § 23 (1) numbers 5 to 11 concerning

the determination of substances hazardous to water and their classification according to their hazardousness, a required participation of the Federal Environment Agency and other bodies, as well as duties of participation of facility operators in connection with the classification of substances,

the establishment of a commission to advise the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection on questions of substance classification, including related organizational matters,

requirements for the quality and location of facilities under subsection 1,

technical rules that correspond to the generally accepted rules of technology,

duties in the planning, construction, operation, filling, emptying, maintenance, repair, monitoring, inspection, cleaning, decommissioning, and modification of facilities under subsection 1, as well as duties upon the escape of substances hazardous to water from such facilities; the ordinance may reserve the performance of certain activities for experts or specialized companies,

powers of the competent authority to establish requirements for facilities under subsection 1 in individual cases and to impose specific measures on the operators of such facilities,

requirements for experts and expert organizations, as well as for specialized companies and quality and monitoring communities.

(5) Further Land law provisions for particularly sensitive areas remain unaffected.

(6) §§ 62 and 63 do not apply to facilities within the meaning of subsection 1 for handling

wastewater,

substances that exceed the exemption limits of radiation protection law with regard to radioactivity.

(7) (repealed)

§ 62a National action programme for the protection of water bodies from nitrate pollution from facilities
The Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection, in agreement with the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, shall develop a national action programme within the meaning of Article 5 (1) in conjunction with (4) letter b, Article 4 (1) letter a, and Annex II letter A number 5 of Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (OJ L 375 of 31.12.1991, p. 1), last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1137/2008 (OJ L 311 of 21.11.2008, p. 1). This contains in particular information on the quality, location, construction, and operation of facilities for storing and filling liquid manure, slurry, and silage effluent, as well as comparable substances arising in agriculture. A Strategic Environmental Assessment under the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment shall be carried out for the draft of the action programme and for drafts for the amendment of the action programme. The action programme and its amendments shall be taken into account when issuing the ordinance on the basis of § 23 (1) numbers 5 to 11 in conjunction with § 62 (4).

§ 63 Suitability assessment
(1) Facilities for storing, filling, or transshipping substances hazardous to water may only be constructed, operated, and significantly modified if their suitability has been determined by the competent authority. § 13 (1) and § 17 apply accordingly.

(2) Subsection 1 does not apply

to facilities for storing and filling liquid manure, slurry, and silage effluent, as well as comparable substances arising in agriculture,

if substances hazardous to water are
a) made available or stored for a short time in connection with transport and the containers or packaging comply with the provisions and requirements for transport in public traffic,
b) kept in laboratories in the quantity required for manual use.
By ordinance under § 23 (1) numbers 5, 6, and 10, it may be regulated

under which conditions, beyond the regulations of sentence 1, no suitability assessment is required,

that, beyond the regulations of subsection 4, certain parts of facilities are considered suitable, including the conditions to be met for this.

(3) The suitability assessment is not required if

a building permit has been granted for the facility and

the building permit presupposes compliance with the water law requirements.

(4) The following parts of facilities are considered suitable:

construction products within the meaning of Article 2 numbers 1 and 2 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC (OJ L 88 of 4.4.2011, p. 5), if
a) the construction products are covered by a harmonised standard within the meaning of Article 2 number 11 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 or correspond to a European Technical Assessment within the meaning of Article 2 number 13 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 and the CE marking has been affixed, and
b) the declared performances cover all essential characteristics of the harmonised standard or the European Technical Assessment that serve the protection of water bodies,

serially manufactured construction products that do not fall under number 1 and for which a proof of usability has been issued under building code provisions, which ensures compliance with the water law requirements,

parts of facilities that are assembled from construction products, provided that a type approval or a general building authority approval has been issued for them under building code provisions, which in each case ensures compliance with the water law requirements,

pressure equipment within the meaning of § 2 sentence 1 number 3 of the Pressure Equipment Ordinance of 13 May 2015 (BGBl. I p. 692), amended by Article 2 of the Ordinance of 6 April 2016 (BGBl. I p. 597), and assemblies within the meaning of § 2 sentence 1 number 1 of this Ordinance, provided that the CE marking has been affixed and the pressure equipment and assemblies are put into operation in accordance with the operating instructions and the safety information under § 6 (3) of this Ordinance, and

machinery within the meaning of § 2 numbers 1 to 4 of the Machinery Ordinance of 12 May 1993 (BGBl. I p. 704), last amended by Article 19 of the Act of 8 November 2011 (BGBl. I p. 2178), provided that the CE marking has been affixed and the machinery is put into operation in accordance with the operating instructions and the safety requirements under § 3 (2) number 1 of this Ordinance.
If, for construction products under sentence 1 number 1, the declared performances do not meet the water law requirements for the respective use, the facility as a whole must be of such a nature that the water law requirements are met. For parts of facilities under sentence 1 numbers 4 and 5, the water law requirements for the retention of substances hazardous to water remain unaffected. Pressure equipment and assemblies under sentence 1 number 4, for which an operator's inspection body has issued an EU declaration of conformity under § 2 sentence 1 number 10 of the Pressure Equipment Ordinance, do not require a CE marking.

(5) For serially manufactured construction products that do not fall under subsection 4 sentence 1 number 1, as well as for parts of facilities that are assembled from construction products, the proofs of usability under subsection 4 sentence 1 number 2 and the type approvals or general building authority approvals under subsection 4 sentence 1 number 3 are equivalent to approvals from another Member State of the European Union, another contracting state of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, or Turkey, if the same level of protection is permanently achieved with the approvals. The results of tests on parts of facilities under sentence 1, which have already been carried out in another Member State of the European Union, another contracting state of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, or Turkey, shall be taken into account in the suitability assessment.

Section 4
Water Protection Officers

§ 64 Appointment of Water Protection Officers
(1) Water body users who are permitted to discharge more than 750 cubic meters of wastewater per day must immediately appoint one or more operational officers for water protection (Water Protection Officers).

(2) The competent authority may order that

dischargers of wastewater into water bodies for whom an obligation to appoint Water Protection Officers under subsection 1 does not exist,

dischargers of wastewater into wastewater facilities,

operators of facilities under § 62 (1),

operators of pipeline installations under number 19.3 of Appendix 1 of the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment
shall appoint one or more Water Protection Officers.

(3) If an immission control officer is to be appointed under § 53 of the Federal Immission Control Act or a waste officer under § 59 of the Circular Economy Act, this person may also assume the tasks and duties of a Water Protection Officer under this Act.

§ 65 Tasks of Water Protection Officers
(1) Water Protection Officers shall advise the water body user and the operational staff in matters that may be significant for water protection. They are entitled and obliged to

monitor compliance with provisions, ancillary provisions, and orders in the interest of water protection, in particular by regularly inspecting the wastewater facilities with regard to their functionality, proper operation, and maintenance, by measuring the wastewater in terms of quantity and properties, by recording the control and measurement results; they shall report identified deficiencies to the water body user and propose measures for their elimination;

promote the application of suitable wastewater treatment methods, including procedures for the proper recycling or disposal of the residues produced during wastewater treatment;

promote the development and introduction of
a) internal procedures for the avoidance or reduction of wastewater generation by type and quantity,
b) environmentally friendly productions;

educate the operational staff about the water body pollution caused in the operation and about the facilities and measures for its prevention, taking into account the water law provisions.

(2) Water Protection Officers shall submit an annual written or electronic report to the water body user on the measures taken and planned under subsection 1 sentence 2 numbers 1 to 4. For EMAS sites, an annual report is not required if equivalent information is provided in the report on the environmental audit and the Water Protection Officers have co-signed the report and have agreed to waive the preparation of a separate annual report.

(3) The competent authority may, in individual cases,

regulate the tasks of the Water Protection Officers listed in subsections 1 and 2 in more detail,

expand them, insofar as the interests of water protection so require,

restrict them, if the proper self-monitoring is not thereby impaired.

§ 66 Other applicable provisions
§§ 55 to 58 of the Federal Immission Control Act apply accordingly to the relationship between the water body user and the Water Protection Officers.

Section 5
Water Body Development, Dike, Dam, and Coastal Protection Structures

§ 67 Principle, definition
(1) Water bodies shall be developed in such a way that natural retention areas are preserved, the natural runoff behavior is not significantly altered, natural habitat communities are preserved, and other adverse changes in the status of the water body are avoided or, if this is not possible, are compensated for.

(2) Water body development is the creation, removal, and significant alteration of a water body or its banks. Water body development does not exist if a water body is created only for a limited period and the water balance is not significantly impaired thereby. Dike and dam constructions that influence the flood runoff, as well as coastal protection structures, are equivalent to water body development.

§ 68 Plan approval, plan permission
(1) Water body development requires plan approval by the competent authority.

(2) For a water body development for which there is no obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment under the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment, a plan permission may be granted instead of a plan approval decision. The Länder may determine that coastal protection structures for which there is no obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment under the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment require, instead of an authorization under sentence 1, another or no authorization or a notification.

(3) The plan may only be approved or permitted if

an impairment of the public good, in particular a significant and permanent, non-compensable increase in flood risks or a destruction of natural retention areas, especially in alluvial forests, is not to be expected, and

other requirements under this Act or other public-law provisions are met.

(4) The Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration shall, within the scope of its duties under the Federal Waterways Act, carry out measures for the significant alteration of a federal inland waterway or its banks under § 67 (2) sentences 1 and 2 in a sovereign capacity, insofar as they are necessary to achieve the management objectives in accordance with §§ 27 to 31.

§ 69 Section-wise authorization, early commencement
(1) Water body developments, including necessary follow-up measures, which are carried out in independent sections or stages due to their spatial or temporal scope, may be authorized in corresponding parts if the necessary inclusion of the significant effects of the entire project on the environment is not thereby made wholly or partly impossible.

(2) § 17 applies accordingly to the authorization of early commencement in a plan approval procedure and a plan permission procedure under § 68.

§ 70 Applicable provisions, procedures
(1) For the plan approval and the plan permission, § 13 (1) and § 14 (3) to (6) apply accordingly; in all other respects, §§ 72 to 78 of the Administrative Procedure Act apply. For the granting of plan approvals and plan permissions in connection with the construction, operation, and modernization of facilities for the use of hydropower, excluding pumped-storage power plants, § 11a (1) sentence 2 and (2) to (5) apply accordingly; §§ 71a to 71e of the Administrative Procedure Act are to be applied.

(2) The plan approval procedure for a water body development for which there is an obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment under the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment must meet the requirements of the Act on the Environmental Impact Assessment.

(3) If an intended development extends to a water body that is under the administration of several Länder and an agreement on the development plan cannot be reached, the Federal Government shall mediate between the Länder upon application by a participating Land.

§ 70a Plan approval procedures for ports in the trans-European transport network
(1) If a plan approval procedure or a plan permission procedure for a water body development under § 68 is carried out, it must be completed within four years if

the water body development serves the expansion of a seaport or inland port for freight traffic according to Appendix 3 and

the estimated total costs of the expansion at the time of initiating the plan approval procedure or the plan permission procedure exceed 300,000,000 Euros.
The period begins with the receipt of the complete plan at the single point of contact under subsection 2 or at the hearing authority and the plan approval authority. These authorities, as well as all other authorities involved in the plan approval procedure or the plan permission procedure, shall endeavor to give priority to the plan approval procedures or plan permission procedures under sentence 1 in their processing. In doing so, the interest in accelerating other projects that are of overriding public interest or serve public safety shall be taken into account.

(2) At the request of the proponent of a project under subsection 1 sentence 1, the plan approval procedure or plan permission procedure, as well as all other authorization procedures required for the expansion of the seaport or inland port for freight traffic according to Appendix 3 under federal or Land law, shall be handled through a single point of contact. The single point of contact shall publish information on the internet about which projects it is competent for and which other single points of contact in the respective Land are competent for projects under subsection 1 sentence 1.

(3) The plan approval authority or the single point of contact shall, upon the project proponent's request, provide information about

all information and documents to be provided for the issuance of the plan approval decision or the plan permission, including all opinions that must be obtained and submitted for the plan approval decision or the plan permission,

other authorizations that are required for the expansion of the seaport or inland port, and the authorities competent for issuing these authorizations.
If the project does not have the required maturity, the application shall be rejected by the competent authority no later than four months after its receipt.

(4) At the request of the plan approval authority, the competent supreme Land authority or another authority designated by it may extend the period under subsection 1 sentence 1. The reasons for the exceeding of the deadline must be set out in the request. A further extension may be granted once under the same conditions.

(5) Subsections 1 to 4 do not apply to projects whose plan was submitted to the hearing authority and plan approval authority or to the single point of contact before 10 August 2023.

(6) For the preparation of the report to the European Commission, § 10c of the Air Traffic Act applies accordingly to plan approval procedures and plan permission procedures for water body developments under subsection 1 sentence 1.

(7) Subsections 1 to 6 do not apply if, for the expansion of a seaport or inland port for freight traffic according to Appendix 3, another authorization procedure is to be carried out under Land law provisions instead of a plan approval procedure or plan permission procedure under § 68.

§ 71 Expropriation law provisions
(1) If the water body development serves the public good, it may be determined in the approval of the plan that expropriation is permissible for its implementation. Sentence 1 applies accordingly to the plan permission if the rights of others are only insignificantly impaired. In the cases of sentences 1 and 2, the determination of the permissibility of expropriation is not independently contestable.

(2) Expropriation is permissible for the public good, insofar as it is necessary for the implementation of an approved or permitted plan that serves coastal or flood protection. Notwithstanding subsection 1 sentence 1, also in conjunction with sentence 2, no determination is required in the approval or permission of the plan. Further legal provisions of the Länder remain unaffected.

(3) The approved or permitted plan shall be taken as the basis for the expropriation procedure and is binding on the expropriation authority.

(4) In all other respects, the expropriation laws of the Länder apply.

§ 71a Early possession order
(1) The competent authority shall, upon application by the proponent of a project for coastal or flood protection, grant possession after the approval of the plan or after the granting of the plan permission, if

the owner or possessor of a property that is needed for the project refuses to transfer possession by agreement, subject to all compensation claims, to the project proponent,

the immediate start of construction work is required for reasons of effective coastal or flood protection, and

the plan approval decision or the plan permission is enforceable.

(2) § 20 (2) to (7) of the Federal Waterways Act apply accordingly.

(3) Further legal provisions of the Länder remain unaffected.

Section 6
Flood Protection

§ 72 Floods
A flood is a temporary inundation of land that is normally not covered by water, in particular by surface waters or by seawater entering coastal areas. Inundations from wastewater facilities are excluded.

§ 73 Assessment of flood risks, risk areas
(1) The competent authorities shall assess the flood risk and subsequently determine the areas with significant flood risk (risk areas). Flood risk is the combination of the probability of the occurrence of a flood event with the potential adverse flood consequences for human health, the environment, cultural heritage, economic activities, and significant material assets.

(2) The risk assessment must comply with the requirements of Article 4 (2) of Directive 2007/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on the assessment and management of flood risks (OJ L 288 of 6.11.2007, p. 27).

(3) The assessment of flood risks and the determination of risk areas shall be carried out for each river basin district. The Länder may assign certain coastal areas, individual catchment areas, or sub-catchment areas to another management unit for the assessment of risks and the determination of risk areas instead of the river basin district.

(4) The competent authorities shall exchange relevant information for the risk assessment with the competent authorities of other Länder and Member States of the European Union in whose territory the relevant management units under subsection 3 also lie. For the determination of risk areas, § 7 (2) and (3) apply accordingly.

(5) The flood risks shall be assessed by 22 December 2011. The assessment is not required if the competent authorities have determined before 22 December 2010

after carrying out a flood risk assessment, that a possible significant risk exists for an area or is likely to occur, and a corresponding assignment of the area has been made, or

hazard maps and risk maps pursuant to § 74 as well as risk management plans pursuant to § 75 have been drawn up or their preparation has been decided upon.

(6) The risk assessment and the determination of risk areas under subsection 1, as well as the decisions and measures under subsection 5 sentence 2, shall be reviewed and, if necessary, updated by 22 December 2018 and every six years thereafter. In doing so, the foreseeable effects of climate change on flood risk shall be taken into account.

§ 74 Hazard maps and risk maps
(1) The competent authorities shall prepare hazard maps and risk maps for the risk areas in the relevant management units under § 73 (3) at the scale best suited for this purpose.

(2) Hazard maps shall cover the areas that are flooded during the following flood events:

Floods with a low probability (foreseeable return period of at least 200 years) or in the case of extreme events,

Floods with a medium probability (foreseeable return period of at least 100 years),

where appropriate, floods with a high probability.
The preparation of hazard maps for sufficiently protected coastal areas and for areas where floods originate from groundwater may be limited to areas under sentence 1 number 1.

(3) Hazard maps must, for each of the areas under subsection 2 sentence 1, contain information on

the extent of the flood,

the water depth or, where appropriate, the water level,

where appropriate, the flow velocity or the significant water flow for the risk assessment.

(4) Risk maps shall cover the potential adverse consequences of the flood events referred to in subsection 2 sentence 1. They must contain the information required under Article 6 (5) of Directive 2007/60/EC.

(5) The competent authorities shall exchange information with the competent authorities of other Länder or other Member States of the European Union before preparing hazard maps and risk maps for risk areas that also lie in their territory. For the exchange of information with other states, § 7 (3) number 2 applies accordingly.

(6) The hazard maps and risk maps shall be prepared by 22 December 2013. Sentence 1 does not apply if comparable maps are available by 22 December 2010, the information content of which meets the requirements of subsections 2 to 4. All maps shall be reviewed and, if necessary, updated by 22 December 2019 and every six years thereafter. The review of the maps under sentence 2 by 22 December 2019 also includes their conformity with the requirements of subsections 2 and 4.

§ 75 Risk management plans
(1) The competent authorities shall draw up risk management plans for the risk areas on the basis of the hazard maps and risk maps in accordance with the provisions of subsections 2 to 6. § 7 (4) sentence 1 applies accordingly.

(2) Risk management plans serve to reduce the adverse consequences that arise from at least a flood with a medium probability in surface waters and from at least an extreme event in the protection of coastal areas, insofar as this is possible and proportionate. The plans shall establish appropriate objectives for risk management for the risk areas, in particular for reducing potential adverse flood consequences for the protected assets mentioned in § 73 (1) sentence 2 and, where necessary, for non-structural flood prevention measures and for reducing the probability of flooding.

(3) Measures for achieving the objectives established under subsection 2 shall be included in the risk management plans. Risk management plans must contain at least the information specified in the Annex to Directive 2007/60/EC and meet the requirements of Article 7 (3) sentences 2 to 4 of that Directive.

(4) Risk management plans may not contain measures that significantly increase the flood risk for other countries and states in the same catchment area or sub-catchment area. Sentence 1 does not apply if the measures have been coordinated with the affected country or state and a mutually agreed solution has been found within the framework of § 80.

(5) If the relevant management units under § 73 (3) lie entirely within German territory, a single risk management plan shall be drawn up, or several risk management plans coordinated at the river basin district level shall be drawn up. For the coordination of risk management plans with other states, § 7 (3) applies accordingly with the aim of drawing up a single risk management plan or several plans coordinated at the river basin district level. If this is not achieved, coordination shall be sought as extensively as possible in accordance with sentence 2.

(6) The risk management plans shall be drawn up by 22 December 2015. Sentence 1 does not apply if comparable plans are available by 22 December 2010, the information content of which meets the requirements of subsections 2 to 4. All plans shall be reviewed and, if necessary, updated by 22 December 2021 and every six years thereafter, taking into account the foreseeable effects of climate change on flood risk. The review of the comparable plans within the meaning of sentence 2 by 22 December 2021 also includes their conformity with the requirements of subsections 2 to 4.

§ 76 Floodplains on surface waters
(1) Floodplains are areas between surface waters and dikes or high banks and other areas that are inundated or flowed through during a flood of a surface water body or that are used for flood relief or retention. This does not apply to areas that are predominantly influenced by tides, unless otherwise provided by Land law.

(2) The state government shall designate by ordinance

within the risk areas or the areas assigned under § 73 (5) sentence 2 number 1, at least the areas in which a flood event is statistically to be expected once in 100 years, and

the areas used for flood relief and retention
as floodplains. Areas under sentence 1 number 1 shall be designated by 22 December 2013. The designations shall be adapted to new findings. The state government may delegate the authorization under sentence 1 to other state authorities by ordinance.

(3) Floodplains not yet designated under subsection 2 shall be identified, presented in map form, and provisionally secured.

(4) The public shall be informed of the planned designation of floodplains; they shall be given the opportunity to comment. They shall be informed of the designated and provisionally secured areas, including the protection provisions applicable therein, as well as of the measures for avoiding adverse flood consequences.

§ 77 Retention areas, stockpiling
(1) Floodplains within the meaning of § 76 shall be preserved in their function as retention areas. Insofar as overriding reasons of public good conflict with this, the necessary compensatory measures shall be taken in good time. Compensatory measures under sentence 2 may also be measures for the purpose of coastal protection or protection against floods that

are taken for the purpose of compensating for future losses of retention areas, or

also serve as compensatory or replacement measures under § 15 (2) of the Federal Nature Conservation Act or can be recognized under § 16 (1) of the Federal Nature Conservation Act.

(2) Former floodplains that are suitable as retention areas should be restored as far as possible if overriding reasons of public good do not conflict with this.

§ 78 Structural protection measures for designated floodplains
(1) In designated floodplains, the designation of new building areas in land-use plans or in other statutes under the Federal Building Code in the undeveloped area is prohibited. Sentence 1 does not apply if the designation serves exclusively to improve flood protection, as well as for land-use plans for ports and shipyards.

(2) The competent authority may, notwithstanding subsection 1 sentence 1, exceptionally permit the designation of new building areas if

no other possibilities for settlement development exist or can be created,

the newly designated area is immediately adjacent to an existing building area,

a danger to life or health or significant property damage is not to be expected,

the flood runoff and the water level are not adversely affected,

the flood retention is not impaired and the loss of lost retention volume is compensated for in terms of scope, function, and time,

the existing flood protection is not impaired,

no adverse effects on upstream and downstream parties are to be expected,

the interests of flood prevention are observed, and

the building projects are constructed in such a way that no structural damage is to be expected from the design flood under § 76 (2) sentence 1, on which the designation of the floodplain is based.
In examining the prerequisites of sentence 1 numbers 3 to 8, the effects on the neighborhood shall also be taken into account.

(3) In designated floodplains, the municipality shall, in the preparation, amendment, or supplementation of land-use plans for areas to be assessed under § 30 (1) and (2) or § 34 of the Federal Building Code, particularly take into account in the balancing under § 1 (7) of the Federal Building Code:

the avoidance of adverse effects on upstream and downstream parties,

the avoidance of an impairment of the existing flood protection, and

the flood-adapted construction of building projects.
This applies accordingly to statutes under § 34 (4) and § 35 (6) of the Federal Building Code. The competent authority shall make the information required for this under § 4 (2) sentence 6 of the Federal Building Code available to the municipality.

(4) In designated floodplains, the construction or extension of structural works under §§ 30, 33, 34, and 35 of the Federal Building Code is prohibited. Sentence 1 does not apply to measures of water body development, the construction of dikes and dams, water body and dike maintenance, and flood protection, as well as measurement systems.

(5) The competent authority may, notwithstanding subsection 4 sentence 1, permit the construction or extension of a structural work in individual cases if

the project
a) does not or only insignificantly impairs flood retention and the loss of lost retention volume is compensated for in terms of scope, function, and time,
b) does not adversely alter the water level and runoff during a flood,
c) does not impair the existing flood protection, and
d) is carried out in a flood-adapted manner, or

the adverse effects can be compensated for by ancillary provisions.
In examining the prerequisites of sentence 1, the effects on the neighborhood shall also be taken into account. For the granting of the permit, § 11a (4) and (5) apply accordingly if it is a facility for the generation of energy from renewable sources.

(6) In the designation under § 76 (2), the construction or extension of structural works may also be generally permitted if they

correspond to the specifications of the development plan in areas newly designated under subsection 2 pursuant to § 30 of the Federal Building Code, or

are of such a nature by their construction that compliance with the prerequisites of subsection 5 sentence 1 number 1 is ensured.
In the cases of sentence 1, the project requires a notification.

(7) Structural works of the transport infrastructure that do not fall under subsection 4 may only be constructed or extended in a flood-adapted manner.

(8) For areas identified, presented in map form, and provisionally secured under § 76 (3), subsections 1 to 7 apply accordingly.

§ 78a Other Protection Measures for Designated Floodplains
(1) The following are prohibited in designated floodplains:

the erection of walls, embankments, or similar structures that may impede water runoff,

the application and depositing of substances hazardous to water on the ground, unless the substances may be used as part of proper agricultural and forestry management,

the storage of substances hazardous to water outside of facilities,

the depositing and the not merely temporary storage of objects that may impede water runoff or be washed away,

the raising or lowering of the ground surface,

the planting of trees and shrubs, insofar as these conflict with the objectives of precautionary flood protection pursuant to § 6 (1) sentence 1 number 6 and § 75 (2),

the conversion of grassland into arable land,

the conversion of alluvial forest into another type of use.
Sentence 1 does not apply to measures of water body development, the construction of dikes and dams, water body and dike maintenance, flood protection, including measures to improve or restore the water inflow or outflow on retention areas, to measurement systems, or to actions that are necessary for the operation of authorized facilities or as part of authorized water body uses.

(2) The competent authority may, in individual cases, permit measures under subsection 1 sentence 1 if

the interests of the public good are not opposed,

the flood runoff and flood retention are not significantly impaired, and

a danger to life or health or significant property damage is not to be feared
or if the adverse effects can be compensated for by ancillary provisions. The permit may, also subsequently, be furnished with ancillary provisions or be revoked. In examining the prerequisites of sentence 1 numbers 2 and 3, the effects on the neighborhood shall also be taken into account.

(3) In the event of an imminent danger of flooding, objects under subsection 1 number 4 must be immediately removed from the danger area by their owner.

(4) In the ordinance under § 76 (2), measures under subsection 1 sentence 1 numbers 1 to 8 may also be generally permitted.

(5) In the ordinance under § 76 (2), further measures may be determined or provisions may be enacted, insofar as this is necessary

for the preservation or improvement of the ecological structures of the water bodies and their floodplains,

for the avoidance or reduction of erosion or of significantly adverse effects on water bodies, which emanate in particular from agriculturally used areas,

for the preservation or recovery, in particular reclamation, of retention areas,

for the regulation of flood runoff,

for the flood-adapted handling of substances hazardous to water,

for the avoidance of disturbances to the water supply and wastewater disposal.
Determinations under sentence 1 may also be made by official decisions in cases of urgency. Sentence 2 does not apply to facilities of the transport infrastructure. If orders are made for the reclamation of retention areas that establish increased requirements for the proper agricultural or forestry use of a property, § 52 (5) applies accordingly.

(6) For areas identified, presented in map form, and provisionally secured under § 76 (3), subsections 1 to 5 apply accordingly.

(7) Further legal provisions of the Länder remain unaffected.

§ 78b Risk Areas outside of Floodplains
(1) Risk areas outside of floodplains are areas for which hazard maps are to be prepared under § 74 (2) and which are not designated or provisionally secured as floodplains under § 76 (2) or (3); this does not apply to areas that are predominantly influenced by tides, unless otherwise provided by Land law. For risk areas outside of floodplains, the following applies:

in the designation of new building areas in the undeveloped area, as well as in the preparation, amendment, or supplementation of land-use plans for areas to be assessed under § 30 (1) and (2) or under § 34 of the Federal Building Code, the protection of life and health and the avoidance of significant property damage shall be particularly taken into account in the balancing of interests under § 1 (7) of the Federal Building Code; this applies accordingly to statutes under § 34 (4) and § 35 (6) of the Federal Building Code;

outside the areas covered by number 1, structural works should only be constructed or significantly extended in a construction method adapted to the respective flood risk in accordance with the generally accepted rules of technology, insofar as such a construction method is technically possible according to the type and function of the facility; in the requirements for the construction method, the location of the affected property and the extent of the possible damage should also be adequately taken into account.

(2) Further legal provisions of the Länder remain unaffected.

(1) The erection of new fuel oil consumer installations in designated and provisionally secured floodplains is prohibited. The competent authority may, upon application, grant exceptions to the prohibition under sentence 1 if no other less water-hazardous energy sources are available at economically justifiable costs and the fuel oil consumer installation is constructed in a flood-proof manner.

(2) The erection of new fuel oil consumer installations in areas under § 78b (1) sentence 1 is prohibited if other less water-hazardous energy sources are available at economically justifiable costs or the installation cannot be constructed in a flood-proof manner. A fuel oil consumer installation under sentence 1 may be erected as planned if the project is notified to the competent authority with the complete documents at least six weeks before construction and the authority, within a period of four weeks after receipt of the notification, neither prohibits the erection nor establishes requirements for the flood-proof construction.

(3) Fuel oil consumer installations that exist on 5 January 2018 in designated or in provisionally secured floodplains must be retrofitted by the operator to be flood-proof in accordance with the generally accepted rules of technology by 5 January 2023. Fuel oil consumer installations that exist on 5 January 2018 in areas under § 78b (1) sentence 1 must be retrofitted to be flood-proof in accordance with the generally accepted rules of technology by 5 January 2033, insofar as this is economically justifiable. If fuel oil consumer installations are significantly modified, they must be retrofitted to be flood-proof at the time of the modification, notwithstanding sentences 1 and 2.

§ 78d Flood Generation Areas
(1) Flood generation areas are areas in which strong surface runoffs can occur in a short time during heavy precipitation events or snowmelt, which can lead to a flood hazard on surface waters and thus to a significant danger for public safety and order.

(2) The Länder may establish criteria for the existence of a flood generation area. In this context, within the framework of the hydrological and topographical conditions, in particular the ratio of precipitation to runoff, the soil properties, the slope inclination, the settlement structure, and the land use shall be taken into account. On the basis of these criteria, the state government may designate flood generation areas by ordinance.

(3) In designated flood generation areas, the natural water infiltration and water retention capacity of the soil shall be maintained or improved, in particular by unsealing soils or by the sustainable afforestation of suitable areas, in order to avoid or reduce dangers from flooding. Sentence 1 does not apply to facilities of the public transport infrastructure.

(4) In designated flood generation areas, the following projects require a permit from the competent authority:

the erection or significant modification of structural works in the undeveloped area, including ancillary facilities and other areas from a total area to be sealed of 1,500 square meters,

the construction of new roads,

the removal of forest or the conversion of forest into another type of use, or

the conversion of grassland into arable land.
The permit under sentence 1 is deemed to have been granted if the competent authority does not reject the application within six months of receipt of the complete application documents. The competent authority may extend the period for an important reason by up to two months. If an authorization procedure is prescribed for the project under other provisions, the authority competent for this shall, notwithstanding sentence 1, decide within the framework of this authorization procedure on the permit prerequisites under subsection 5 in consultation with the competent water authority.

(5) The permit or other authorization under subsection 4 sentence 1 or sentence 4 may only be granted if

the water infiltration or water retention capacity of the soil is not impaired by the project, or

the impairment is adequately compensated for by measures such as the creation of forest or the creation of retention areas in the flood generation area.
For the compensation under sentence 1 number 2, § 77 (1) sentence 3 number 2 applies accordingly. The prerequisites under sentence 1 are considered to be met for the authorization of public transport infrastructure projects for which a procedure under § 17 (1) of the Federal Nature Conservation Act is carried out.

(6) In designated flood generation areas, in the designation of new building areas in the undeveloped area, the following shall be particularly taken into account in the balancing of interests under § 1 (7) of the Federal Building Code:

the avoidance of an impairment of the water infiltration or water retention capacity of the soil, and

the compensation for an impairment by measures such as the creation of forest or the creation of retention areas in the flood generation area.

(7) Further legal provisions of the Länder remain unaffected.

§ 79 Information and active participation
(1) The competent authorities shall publish the assessment under § 73 (1), the hazard maps and risk maps under § 74 (1), and the risk management plans under § 75 (1). They shall promote the active participation of interested parties in the preparation, review, and updating of the risk management plans under § 75 and coordinate these with the measures under § 83 (4) and § 85.

(2) How the competent state authorities and the public in the affected areas are otherwise informed about flood hazards, suitable precautionary measures, and rules of conduct, and are warned in a timely manner of expected floods, is governed by the respective Land law provisions.

§ 80 Coordination
(1) Hazard maps and risk maps shall be prepared in such a way that the information presented therein is compatible with the relevant data submitted under Directive 2000/60/EC, in particular under Article 5 (1) in conjunction with Annex II of that Directive. The information should be coordinated with the reviews provided for in Article 5 (2) of Directive 2000/60/EC; it may be included in them.

(2) The competent authorities shall coordinate the preparation and the updating of the risk management plans required under § 75 (6) sentence 3 with the management plans under § 83. The risk management plans may be included in the management plans.

§ 81 Mediation by the Federal Government
If the Länder cannot agree on a flood protection measure in the course of their cooperation within the framework of this section, the Federal Government shall mediate between the participating Länder upon application by a Land.

The objectives of regional planning shall be observed; the principles and other requirements of regional planning shall be taken into account.

(2) The programme of measures shall include basic and, where necessary, supplementary measures; in this context, a cost-effective combination of measures in relation to water use shall be provided for. The programme of measures also contains measures under Articles 4 to 10 of Directive (EU) 2019/904.

(3) Basic measures are all measures referred to in Article 11 (3) of Directive 2000/60/EC which serve to achieve the management objectives in accordance with §§ 27 to 31, 44, and 47 or contribute to the achievement of these objectives.

(4) Supplementary measures, in particular within the meaning of Article 11 (4) in conjunction with Annex VI Part B of Directive 2000/60/EC, shall be included in the programme of measures in addition to the basic measures, insofar as this is necessary to achieve the management objectives in accordance with §§ 27 to 31, 44, and 47. Supplementary measures may also be taken to achieve a greater level of protection for the water bodies.

(5) If it emerges from monitoring or from other findings that the management objectives in accordance with §§ 27 to 31, 44, and 47 cannot be achieved, the causes for this shall be investigated, the authorizations for water body uses and the monitoring programmes shall be reviewed and, if necessary, adapted, and any necessary additional measures shall be included in the programme of measures.

(6) Basic measures under subsection 3 may not lead to additional pollution of the surface waters, coastal waters, or the sea, unless their implementation would be more beneficial to the environment as a whole. The competent authority may also, within the framework of §§ 47 and 48, permit the discharges into the groundwater mentioned in Article 11 (3) letter j of Directive 2000/60/EC.

Section 8
Liability for Water Body Alterations

§ 89 Liability for alterations of water quality
(1) Anyone who introduces or discharges substances into a water body or who affects a water body in any other way and thereby adversely alters the water quality is liable to compensate for the damage thereby caused to another. If several persons have affected the water body, they are liable as joint and several debtors.

(2) If substances from a facility intended for the production, processing, storage, deposition, transport, or conveyance of such substances enter a water body without being introduced or discharged into it, and the water quality is thereby adversely altered, the operator of the facility is liable to compensate for the damage thereby caused to another. Subsection 1 sentence 2 applies accordingly. The obligation to compensate does not arise if the damage is caused by force majeure.

§ 90 Remediation of water body damage
(1) Damage to a water body within the meaning of the Environmental Damage Act is any damage with significant adverse effects on

the ecological or chemical status of a surface water body or coastal water body,

the ecological potential or the chemical status of an artificial or heavily modified surface water body or coastal water body,

the chemical or quantitative status of groundwater, or

the status of a marine water body;
excluded are adverse effects for which § 31 (2), also in conjunction with § 44 or § 47 (3) sentence 1, applies.

(2) If a responsible person under the Environmental Damage Act has caused damage to a water body, they shall take the necessary remediation measures in accordance with Annex II number 1 of Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (OJ L 143 of 30.4.2004, p. 56), which was amended by Directive 2006/21/EC (OJ L 102 of 11.4.2006, p. 15).

(3) The competent authority for the enforcement of this provision and the provisions of the Environmental Damage Act is, unless otherwise provided, with regard to damage to marine waters outside the coastal waters and the imminent threat of such damage in the area of the German exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf,

insofar as there is a connection with activities under the Federal Mining Act, the authority specified under § 136 of the Federal Mining Act in conjunction with § 142 of the Federal Mining Act, and

otherwise the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation; it shall avail itself, where appropriate, of the assistance of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency and the Federal Environment Agency; it may avail itself of the assistance of other bodies, provided they agree.

(4) Further provisions on damage or other impairments of water bodies and their remediation remain unaffected.

Section 9
Obligations of Toleration and Permission

§ 91 Hydrological measures
The competent authority may oblige owners and persons entitled to use properties to tolerate the construction and operation of measuring facilities as well as the carrying out of test drillings and pumping tests, insofar as this serves the determination of hydrological bases that are necessary for water management. If damage to the property arises from a measure under sentence 1, the owner has a claim for damages against the proponent of the hydrological measure. Sentence 2 applies accordingly to the person entitled to use if the use of the property is impaired due to the damage to the property.

BGBl. I 2010, 275); time limit lifted by Art. 79 (1) of the Bavarian Water Act (BayWG) of 25.2.2010 GVBl 2010, 66, BayRS 753-1-U in the version of § 1 No. 4 of the Act Amending the Bavarian Water Act of 16.2.2012 GVBl 2012, 40 with effect from 29.2.2012 (cf. BGBl. I 2015, 156)

§ 92 Alteration of surface waters
The competent authority may oblige owners and persons entitled to use surface waters and the properties whose use is necessary for the implementation of the project to tolerate water body alterations, in particular deepening and widening, that serve to improve the water runoff and for the drainage of properties, for wastewater disposal, or for the better utilization of a power plant. Sentence 1 applies only if the project cannot be carried out equally effectively in another way or only with considerable additional expense and the benefit to be expected from the project is significantly greater than the detriment to the affected person.

§ 93 Conveyance of water and wastewater
The competent authority may oblige owners and persons entitled to use properties and surface waters to tolerate the conveyance of water and wastewater and the construction and maintenance of the facilities serving this purpose, insofar as this is necessary for the drainage or irrigation of properties, for the water supply, for wastewater disposal, for the operation of an impoundment facility, or for the protection against or compensation for impairments of the natural or water balance due to a lack of water. § 92 sentence 2 applies accordingly.

§ 94 Joint use of facilities
(1) The competent authority may oblige operators of a property drainage, water supply, or wastewater facility to permit its joint use by another person if

this person cannot carry out measures for drainage, water supply, or wastewater disposal otherwise effectively or only with considerable additional expense,

the measures are necessary for water management or for the fulfillment of statutory obligations,

the operation of the facility is not significantly impaired, and

the person entitled to joint use assumes an appropriate share of the costs for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility.
If an agreement on the cost sharing under sentence 1 number 4 cannot be reached, the competent authority shall set an appropriate fee.

(2) If joint use is only effective with a modification of the facility, the operator may be obliged to either carry out the corresponding modification itself at its own discretion or to tolerate it. The costs of the modification shall be borne by the person entitled to joint use.

(3) Subsections 1 and 2 also apply to the joint use of property irrigation facilities by owners of properties who are entitled to use the facility for its construction or operation under § 93.

§ 95 Compensation for obligations of toleration and permission
Insofar as obligations of toleration or permission under §§ 92 to 94 unreasonably restrict ownership, compensation shall be paid.

Chapter 4
Compensation, Indemnification, Right of First Refusal

§ 96 Type and scope of compensation obligations
(1) Compensation to be paid under this Act shall adequately compensate for the financial loss incurred. Insofar as uses are being made at the time of the official order that triggers the compensation obligation, the extent of their impairment shall be taken as a basis. If the person entitled to claim has taken measures to increase the uses, and it is demonstrated that the measures would have sustainably increased the uses, this shall be taken into account. Furthermore, a reduction in the market value of properties that has occurred as a result of the official order shall be taken into account, insofar as it is not already taken into account under sentence 2 or sentence 3.

(2) Insofar as water management or other measures are not permitted as compensation by law, the compensation shall be fixed in money.

(3) If, due to a measure giving rise to a compensation obligation, the hydropower of a power plant can no longer be utilized to the previous extent, the competent authority may determine that the compensation is to be paid wholly or partly by the supply of electrical power, if the person liable for compensation is an energy supply company and insofar as this is economically reasonable for them. The person liable for compensation shall bear the costs of the technical installations required for the supply of the electrical power.

(4) If the use of a property becomes impossible or is made considerably more difficult as a result of the official order giving rise to the compensation obligation, the property owner may demand that the person liable for compensation acquire the property at its market value. If the unaffected part of a property can no longer be used appropriately according to its previous purpose, the property owner may also demand the acquisition of this part. If the property owner is dependent on replacement land to secure their existence and replacement land can be procured under reasonable conditions, they shall, upon request, be provided with ownership of a replacement property instead of compensation in money.

(5) If the beneficiary is liable for compensation under § 97, the person entitled to claim may demand the provision of security.

§ 97 Person liable for compensation
Insofar as this Act does not provide otherwise, compensation shall be paid by whoever is directly benefited by the event that triggers the compensation obligation. If several persons are directly benefited, they are liable as joint and several debtors. If no one is directly benefited, the Land shall pay the compensation. If a benefited person can be identified at a later date, they shall reimburse the Land for the compensation amounts expended.

§ 98 Compensation procedures
(1) Claims for compensation shall be decided upon simultaneously with the order on which the claim is based. The decision may be limited to the obligation to compensate in principle.

(2) Before determining the amount of compensation under subsection 1, the competent authority shall work towards an amicable settlement between the parties if one of the parties so requests. If no agreement is reached, the authority shall determine the compensation.

§ 99 Indemnification
Indemnification under § 52 (5) and § 78a (5) sentence 4 shall be paid in money. In all other respects, § 96 (1) and (5) and § 97 apply accordingly to indemnification under sentence 1.

§ 99a Right of first refusal
(1) The Länder have a right of first refusal for properties that are needed for flood or coastal protection measures. If the characteristics of sentence 1 apply only to a part of the property, the right of first refusal extends only to this part of the property. The owner may demand that the pre-emption extend to the entire property if the continued retention of the other part of the property in their ownership is not economically reasonable for them.

(2) The right of first refusal does not apply to the Länder in the case of a purchase of rights under the Condominium Act.

(3) The right of first refusal may only be exercised if this is necessary for reasons of flood protection or coastal protection.

(4) The right of first refusal does not require entry in the land register. It takes precedence over rights of first refusal established by legal transaction and by Land law, with the exception of those in the field of agricultural and forestry land transactions and settlement. Upon acquisition of ownership based on the exercise of the right of first refusal, rights of first refusal established by legal transaction shall expire. The right of first refusal does not extend to a sale to a spouse, a registered civil partner, or a first-degree relative. §§ 463 to 469, 471, 1098 (2), and §§ 1099 to 1102 of the German Civil Code are to be applied.

(5) The Länder may also exercise the right of first refusal upon application in favor of public corporations and foundations.

(6) Deviating legal provisions of the Länder remain unaffected.

Chapter 5
Water Body Supervision

§ 100 Tasks of water body supervision
(1) The task of water body supervision is to supervise the water bodies as well as the fulfillment of public-law obligations that exist under or on the basis of provisions of this Act, of ordinances based on this Act, or of Land law provisions. The competent authority shall order, at its due discretion, the measures that are necessary in individual cases to avoid or eliminate impairments of the water balance or to ensure the fulfillment of obligations under sentence 1.

(2) Authorizations granted on the basis of this Act and Land law provisions shall be reviewed regularly and on special occasions and, where necessary, adapted.

§ 101 Powers of water body supervision
(1) Officials and agents of the competent authority are authorized, within the scope of water body supervision, to

navigate water bodies,

carry out technical investigations and tests,

demand that information be provided, documents be submitted, and workers, tools, and other technical aids be made available,

enter business premises and rooms during business hours,

enter residential premises as well as business premises and rooms outside of business hours, provided that the inspection is necessary to prevent imminent dangers to public safety and order, and

enter at any time properties and facilities that do not belong to the immediately adjoining enclosed property of rooms under numbers 4 and 5.
The fundamental right to the inviolability of the home (Article 13 of the Basic Law) is restricted by sentence 1 number 5. If Water Protection Officers are appointed, they shall be called in for measures of water body supervision under sentence 1 at the request of the officials and agents of the competent authority.

(2) If facilities under § 62 (1) are constructed, maintained, operated, or decommissioned, the owners and possessors of the properties on which these activities are carried out must also permit entry to the properties, provide information upon request, and facilitate technical investigations and tests.

(3) For the person obliged to provide information, § 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applies accordingly.

(4) For the authorities competent for supervision under subsections 1 and 2 and their officials, §§ 93, 97, 105 (1), § 111 (5) in conjunction with § 105 (1), and § 116 (1) of the Fiscal Code do not apply. This does not apply if the tax authorities require the information for the conduct of proceedings for a tax offense and a related taxation procedure, for the prosecution of which there is a compelling public interest, or if it concerns intentionally false statements by the person obliged to provide information or by the persons acting for them.

§ 102 Water body supervision for defense facilities and installations
The Federal Government is authorized to determine by ordinance with the consent of the Bundesrat that water body supervision within the meaning of this chapter for facilities and installations that serve defense purposes shall be transferred to bodies belonging to the business area of the Federal Ministry of Defence.

§ 104a Exceptions to the permit requirement for existing installations for the underground storage of formation water
(1) The use of an installation for the underground storage of formation water, which arises from measures under § 9 (2) number 3 or from other measures for the exploration or extraction of natural gas or crude oil, does not require a permit under § 8 (1), notwithstanding subsection 2, if the installation was constructed before 11 February 2017 in accordance with a finally approved operation plan under § 52 of the Federal Mining Act or if a finally approved operation plan for the installation exists at that time. In these cases, the obligations arising from § 13b (2) and (3) shall be regulated in the respective authorizations of future main operation plans to be drawn up pursuant to § 52 (1) sentence 1 of the Federal Mining Act by 11 February 2019 at the latest. § 13b (4) applies accordingly to the entrepreneur within the meaning of § 4 (5) of the Federal Mining Act in these cases.

(2) The use of an installation under subsection 1 sentence 1, which is no longer permissible under § 22c (1) sentence 3 of the General Federal Mining Ordinance, does not require a permit under § 8 (1) if the installation operator submits, by 11 February 2019 at the latest, applications for authorizations for an alternative disposal of the formation water (disposal concept) that are fundamentally approvable and receives an official confirmation of this under sentence 4. The disposal concept must show how the formation water is to be disposed of in the future, so that in particular the following requirements are met:

the requirements under § 22c (1) sentence 3 of the General Federal Mining Ordinance and

the requirements under § 13a (1) sentence 1 number 2 letter a and b.
Sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly if the installation under subsection 1 sentence 1 is located in an area under § 13a (1) sentence 1 number 2 letter a or letter b. If the competent authority confirms the fundamental approvability of the applications, the use of the installation in the cases of sentences 1 and 3 must be discontinued by 11 February 2022 at the latest. Otherwise, the use of the installation in the cases of sentences 1 and 3 must be discontinued by 11 February 2020 at the latest. Sentences 3 to 5 do not apply if the storage of the formation water for protection zone III of a designated water protection area or a designated curative spring protection area is exceptionally permitted

in an ordinance under § 51 (1), also in conjunction with § 53 (5), or

by official decision; § 52 (1) sentences 2 and 3, also in conjunction with § 53 (5), apply accordingly.

§ 105 Transition of other existing authorizations
(1) An authorization for the discharge of wastewater into public wastewater facilities that was granted before 1 March 2010 continues to be valid as a permit under § 58. An authorization for the discharge of wastewater into private wastewater facilities that was granted before 1 March 2010 continues to be valid as a permit under § 59. A permit under § 58 or § 59 is not required for discharges of wastewater into public or private wastewater facilities that began before 1 March 2010 if the discharge was permissible without a permit under the Land law applicable on 28 February 2010.

(2) An authorization that was granted before 1 March 2010 under § 18c of the Federal Water Act in the version applicable on 28 February 2010 in conjunction with the Land law provisions continues to be valid as a permit under § 60 (3).

(3) A suitability assessment that was granted before 1 March 2010 under § 19h (1) of the Federal Water Act in the version applicable on 28 February 2010 continues to be valid as a suitability assessment under § 63 (1). If a type approval was granted before 1 March 2010 under § 19h (2) of the Federal Water Act in the version applicable on 28 February 2010, a suitability assessment under § 63 (1) is not required.

(4) A plan that was approved or permitted before 1 March 2010 under § 31 (2) or (3) of the Federal Water Act in the version applicable on 28 February 2010 or under Land law provisions is valid as a plan approval decision or as a plan permission under § 68, respectively.

§ 106 Transition of existing protection area designations
(1) Water protection areas designated before 1 March 2010 are valid as designated water protection areas within the meaning of § 51 (1).

(2) Curative spring protection areas designated before 1 March 2010 are valid as designated curative spring protection areas within the meaning of § 53 (4).

(3) Floodplains designated, deemed to be designated, or provisionally secured before 1 March 2010 are valid as designated or provisionally secured floodplains within the meaning of § 76 (2) or (3).

§ 107 Transitional provision for industrial wastewater treatment plants and wastewater discharges from industrial plants
(1) An authorization that was granted before 2 May 2013 under Land law provisions for wastewater treatment plants within the meaning of § 60 (3) sentence 1 number 2 continues to be valid as a permit under § 60 (3) sentence 1. By 7 July 2015, all plants mentioned in sentence 1 must comply with the requirements of § 60 (1) to (3).

(1a) If a facility within the meaning of § 60 (3) sentence 1 number 3 was not authorized as part of a landfill permit but otherwise under Land law provisions before 28 January 2018, this authorization is valid as a permit under § 60 (3) sentence 1. By 28 January 2020, all plants mentioned in sentence 1 must comply with the requirements of § 60 (1) to (3).

(2) Insofar as new requirements have been established by Article 2 of the Act Implementing the Directive on Industrial Emissions of 8 April 2013 (BGBl. I p. 734), these requirements shall be met by discharges from plants under § 3 of the Ordinance on Installations Requiring a Permit, which were in operation at the time of the entry into force of the said Act, from 7 January 2014, if before this date

a permit for the plant was granted under § 4 of the Federal Immission Control Act, or

a complete permit application was submitted by its operator.
Discharges from existing plants under sentence 1 that were not covered by Annex I of Directive 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (OJ L 24 of 29.1.2008, p. 8), which was amended by Directive 2009/31/EC (OJ L 140 of 5.6.2009, p. 114), shall, notwithstanding sentence 1, meet the requirements specified therein from 7 July 2015.

§ 108 Transitional provision for procedures for the authorization of projects for the generation of energy from renewable sources
If an authorization or exemption procedure was initiated before 31 August 2021, to which the provisions of § 11a, also in conjunction with § 38 (5) sentence 3, § 52 (1) sentence 4, § 70 (1) sentence 2, or § 78 (5) sentence 3 would apply, the competent authority shall continue this procedure under the law applicable before 31 August 2021.
