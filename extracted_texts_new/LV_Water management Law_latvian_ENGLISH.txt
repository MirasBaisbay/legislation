**Chapter III**
**Environmental Quality Objectives**

**Article 11. Environmental Quality Objectives for Water Bodies**

(1) The following environmental quality objectives shall be set for water bodies in the management plan:
1) to prevent the deterioration of the status of all bodies of surface water and to protect them by improving water quality and, where necessary, carrying out remediation, in order to achieve good surface water status in all bodies of surface water;
2) to protect and enhance water quality in all heavily modified and artificial water bodies, in order to achieve good ecological potential and good chemical status of surface waters;
3) to progressively reduce pollution from priority substances and to cease or phase out emissions and discharges of substances particularly hazardous to the aquatic environment;
4) to prevent or limit the input of pollutants into groundwater and to prevent the deterioration of the status of all bodies of groundwater;
5) to protect bodies of groundwater, to enhance or restore the status of waters therein, and to ensure a balance between abstraction and replenishment of water resources, in order to achieve good groundwater status in all bodies of groundwater;
6) to reverse any significant and sustained upward trend in the concentration of any pollutant resulting from the impact of human activity in groundwater, in order to progressively reduce pollution;
7) to comply with the conditions and objectives set in the management plan for specially protected areas.
(2) Environmental quality objectives shall be achieved by implementing the management plans and programmes specified in this Law. When determining measures to achieve environmental quality objectives, the status of the specific water body and the status of waters in the other water bodies located in the same catchment basin shall be taken into account.
(3) The environmental quality standards necessary for the achievement of the objectives referred to in paragraph one of this Article shall be determined in accordance with the Law "On Pollution".
(4) Where more than one environmental quality objective applies to a single water body, the most stringent objective shall apply.

(As amended by the Laws of 31.05.2007 and 23.04.2009, which shall enter into force on 27.05.2009.)

**Article 12. Exemptions in Determining Environmental Quality Objectives and Deadlines for their Achievement for Individual Water Bodies**

(1) The management plan may provide for environmental quality objectives for individual water bodies that differ from those specified in Article 11, paragraph one of this Law, if, taking into account the impact of human activity or the natural condition of these water bodies, it is not possible to achieve the objectives referred to in Article 11, paragraph one of this Law, or their achievement would be disproportionately expensive, and also if:
1) the environmental and socio-economic needs served by such anthropogenic activity cannot be met by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option not entailing disproportionate costs;
2) for surface waters, the highest possible ecological and chemical status is aimed for, and for groundwaters, the smallest possible deviation from good groundwater status is ensured, taking into account the impacts of human activity or pollution that cannot be avoided;
3) the status of the water body does not further deteriorate;
4) the setting of different environmental quality objectives and the reasons for it are justified in the management plan, and the said objectives are reviewed at least every six years.
(2) The deadline set in this Law for achieving the environmental quality objectives in individual water bodies may be extended if the status of the respective water body does not deteriorate during this time and if its status cannot be fully improved within the deadline set in this Law, due to one of the following reasons:
1) for technical reasons, the required level of improvement can only be achieved over a longer period than the deadline set by the Law;
2) the cost of completing the improvements within the deadline set by the Law is disproportionately high;
3) natural conditions do not permit improvement of the status of the water body within the deadline set by the Law.
(3) The reasons for extending the deadline shall be stated in the management plan. The extension of the deadline shall not exceed 12 years, except in cases where natural conditions prevent the achievement of the environmental quality objectives within that time.
(4) The management plan shall briefly describe the mandatory and supplementary measures to be taken to progressively achieve the desired status of the water body by the end of the extended deadline, and shall include a timetable for the implementation of the measures and, in the event of non-compliance, an explanation of the causes that have significantly hindered the implementation of these measures. A review of the implementation of the said measures and a summary of other measures taken shall be included in the updated management plan.

(As amended by the Law of 23.04.2009, which shall enter into force on 27.05.2009.)

**Article 13. Temporary Exemptions for the Achievement of Environmental Quality Objectives**

(1) A temporary deterioration in the status of water bodies caused by *force majeure*, including severe floods, prolonged drought or an accident which could not reasonably have been foreseen (hereinafter—exceptional circumstances), shall not be in breach of the requirements of this Law, provided that:
1) all practicable steps are taken to prevent further deterioration in status and not to compromise the achievement of the environmental quality objectives in other water bodies not affected by the said circumstances;
2) the management plan includes the conditions and parameters under which the regional environmental board may apply the provisions of this Article;
3) the programme of measures includes measures to be taken in exceptional circumstances, and these do not compromise the restoration of water quality once the situation has normalised;
4) all practicable steps are taken to restore the status of the water body to that which existed prior to the impact of the exceptional circumstances as soon as reasonably practicable;
5) a summary of the effects of the exceptional circumstances and of the measures taken or to be taken is included in the next update of the management plan.

2) failure to prevent deterioration from high status to good status of a body of surface water is the result of new sustainable human development activities;
3) failure to achieve good status of a body of surface water is due to transboundary pollution.
(2) The exemptions specified in paragraph one of this Article may be authorised by the relevant regional environmental board only if the following conditions are met:
1) all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the water body and not to compromise the achievement of the environmental quality objectives in other water bodies not affected by the said circumstances;
2) the reasons for such exemptions are justified in the management plan, and the said objectives are reviewed at least every six years;
3) the need for such exemptions for the water body is of overriding public interest, and/or the benefits to the environment and to society of achieving the environmental quality objectives are outweighed by the benefits of the modifications or alterations to human health, to the maintenance of human safety or to sustainable development;
4) the beneficial objectives served by these exemptions cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option;
5) the co-operation and coordination measures specified in Article 10 of this Law have been carried out and the requirements specified in Articles 12 and 13 of this Law have been complied with in respect of bodies of surface water affected by transboundary pollution, as a result of which it has not been possible to take effective measures to ensure that surface waters comply with environmental quality standards.
