**Article 16. Installation and Use of Non-flowing Artificial Water Bodies**

1. Non-flowing artificial water bodies shall be installed and used after assessing the environmental conditions and ensuring that such activity will be carried out without violating the environmental and land drainage and irrigation system protection requirements specified in paragraph 2 of this Article.
2. The environmental and land drainage and irrigation system protection requirements for the installation and use of non-flowing artificial water bodies shall be established by the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Agriculture, based on the following main provisions:
1) environmental requirements, taking into account the size of the non-flowing artificial water bodies planned to be installed, must restrict or prohibit the installation of such surface water bodies in conservation priority (preservation) areas and complex protected areas, in the bank protection zones of surface water bodies, on forest land, in areas of mineral deposits, bogs and springs, natural meadows and stony grounds, and in areas flooded during high water. When preparing environmental requirements, the potential negative impact of the installation of non-flowing artificial water bodies on the landscape, groundwater bodies, soil and subsoil, protected species, valuable tree species and other environmental components shall be assessed, and corresponding requirements for the preservation of these environmental components shall be established;
2) when planning to install a non-flowing artificial water body on drained land, its location must be coordinated with the administration of the municipality in whose territory this body is being installed;
3) for the installation of non-flowing artificial water bodies larger than 0.1 ha, requirements shall be established to provide information to the state environmental protection control authorities about the parameters of the planned non-flowing artificial water body (area, depth, profile), its location (land plot plan with the marked location and coordinates of the non-flowing artificial water body) and its compliance with the established environmental requirements. Approval requirements and/or other special requirements or prohibitions for the installation of non-flowing artificial water bodies of this size may be established only in protected areas, in the karst region and/or on forest land;
4) the requirements for the installation and use of non-flowing artificial water bodies up to 0.1 ha in area shall regulate general provisions for the protection of the environment and land drainage and irrigation systems (felling of protected trees, alteration of protected landforms, damage to land drainage and irrigation systems, and others). The information submission requirements set out in point 3 of this paragraph, approval requirements and/or other special requirements or prohibitions for the installation of non-flowing artificial water bodies of this size may be established only in protected areas, in the karst region and/or on forest land.

1) the quantity of wastewater discharged (planned to be discharged) (excluding surface runoff) is 5 m³ or more per day. The quantity of wastewater shall be calculated by dividing the quantity of wastewater discharged (planned to be discharged) per year by the number of discharge days;
2) surface runoff is discharged (planned to be discharged), which is collected from potentially contaminated areas of 1 ha or more (excluding vehicle parking lots);
3) surface runoff is discharged (planned to be discharged), which is collected from areas of 10 ha or more intended for transport (streets, access roads, parking lots);
4) surface runoff is discharged (planned to be discharged) into whose collection system surface runoff from potentially contaminated areas enters, where the total surface runoff collection area is greater than 1 ha;
5) wastewater containing priority substances whose discharge must be progressively phased out is discharged (planned to be discharged) into the natural environment (regardless of the quantity of priority substances discharged);
6) wastewater is discharged (planned to be discharged) into the natural environment (regardless of the quantity/flow of wastewater discharged) in which the concentration of priority substances whose discharge must be reduced is equal to or greater than the limit value for concentration in the natural environment established by the Minister of Environment;
7) wastewater generated from the treatment of flue gases from waste incineration or co-incineration plants is discharged (planned to be discharged);
8) water is discharged (planned to be discharged) from aquaculture ponds, the quantity of which is 5 m³ or more per day. The quantity of water shall be calculated by dividing the quantity of water discharged (planned to be discharged) per year by the number of discharge days.
3. It shall be prohibited to discharge wastewater directly into groundwater bodies, subsurface cavities, karstic sinkholes, or underground land drainage systems. Wastewater may be discharged to the ground in accordance with the procedure established by the Minister of Environment.
4. It shall be prohibited to discharge wastewater directly into lakes and into rivers flowing into them at a distance of less than 500 m from the lake.
