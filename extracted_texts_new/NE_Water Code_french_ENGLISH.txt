*   modifications to water flows;
*   water withdrawals, whether returned or not;
*   discharges, emissions, or direct or indirect, permanent or periodic deposits, even if non-polluting, and more generally any act likely to cause or increase the degradation of water by modifying its physical characteristics, including thermal, chemical, microbiological, and bacteriological characteristics;
*   temporary or permanent occupation of the public water domain or its exploitation for economic and social purposes;
*   risks related to the presence or proximity of water that are likely to affect persons or property.

Public services for the supply of drinking water to populations and livestock are also subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.

Hydro-agricultural developments are also subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.

The developments, works, installations, and activities referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, carried out within the framework of projects benefiting from specific financing, particularly in cooperation with one or more foreign States, an international organization, a non-governmental organization (NGO), or by private individuals, are also subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.

- to meet water needs in a just and equitable manner for:
    *   human consumption;
    *   agriculture and livestock farming;
    *   aquaculture, fishing, and fish farming;
    *   silviculture and forestry;
    *   the environment (ecological and aquatic needs);

    *   navigation;
    *   transport and communications;
    *   tourism and leisure;
    *   any other needs that the authority deems necessary.

    *   the preservation of aquatic ecosystems;
    *   the fight against waste and overexploitation.

**Article 8:** In meeting needs, no use has priority over others, but in the event of competition between several uses, special attention shall be given to essential human needs.

**Article 9:** Water management shall strive to guarantee the sustainable, equitable, and coordinated use of water resources. It is guided by the following principles:
- a comprehensive and integrated approach to water resources by Water Management Unit or aquifer system, known as Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), which includes:
    *   the need to involve users, planners, and decision-makers at all levels in the management and development of water resources;
    *   the recognition of the essential role of women in the development and preservation of water resources;
    *   the recognition of the economic value of water;

- the no-harm principle, according to which the State shall ensure that activities carried out in one part of its territory do not cause damage to another part of its territory or to the territory of a neighboring State;
- the precautionary principle, by virtue of which the State shall defer the implementation of measures in order to avoid any situation likely to have a transboundary impact or an impact on another part of its territory, even if scientific research has not demonstrated a causal link between that situation and a possible impact.

**Article 10:** The ministry in charge of water resources, in conjunction with the other ministries concerned, shall ensure that the public, particularly the populations and users concerned by a water development project, measure, or water management plan, participates in the development and implementation of decisions and receives appropriate information from the competent authorities.

**Article 13:** When the activity of natural or legal persons is likely to cause or aggravate water pollution or the degradation of the aquatic environment, the proponents of said activity shall bear and/or contribute to the financing of the measures that the State and territorial authorities must take against this pollution, in order to offset the effects, and to ensure the conservation of the water resource, according to the "polluter-pays" principle.

**Article 14:** The Republic of Niger shall cooperate with other States and shall endeavor to implement international treaties, conventions, and agreements relating to the knowledge, governance, preservation, protection, mobilization, and use of water resources of a transboundary nature.
The competent Nigerien authorities shall notify other States, through basin organizations, of measures planned by Niger that are likely to have significant negative effects on other States.
