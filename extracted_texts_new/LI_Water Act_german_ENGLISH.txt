If this area can only be determined with disproportionate effort, the inflow area Zu comprises the entire catchment area of the groundwater catchment. 114 Inflow Area Zo The inflow area Zo comprises the catchment area from which the majority of the pollution of the surface water body originates. 12 Water Protection Zones Version: 01.02.2021 51 814.201 WPO 1) Water protection zones comprise large areas with water resources that are suitable for drinking water supply. 2) Water protection zones are to be delimited where the groundwater resource is particularly well suited for drinking water supply and is not endangered by settlement influences. 13 Protection Zones 131 General 1) Protection zones consist of the catchment area (Zone S 1), the inner protection zone (Zone S 2), and the outer protection zone (Zone S 3). In the case of karst and fractured rock groundwater, an inflow area Zu is to be delimited instead of Zone S 3. 2) For the dimensioning of groundwater protection zones for abstraction wells, the maximum quantity of water that may be abstracted must be used as a basis. 132 Catchment Area (Zone S 1) 1) Zone S 1 is intended to prevent groundwater catchments and recharge facilities and their immediate surroundings from being damaged or polluted. 2) It comprises the groundwater catchment or recharge facility, the area loosened by the drilling or construction process, and, where appropriate, the immediate surroundings of the facilities. 133 Inner Protection Zone (Zone S 2) 1) Zone S 2 is intended to prevent: a) germs and viruses from entering the groundwater catchment or recharge facility; b) the groundwater from being polluted by excavations and underground works; and c) the groundwater inflow from being obstructed by underground facilities. 2) In the case of unconsolidated rock groundwater, it is dimensioned in such a way that: a) the flow time of the groundwater from the outer edge of Zone S 2 to the groundwater catchment or recharge facility is at least ten days; and b) the distance from Zone S 1 to the outer edge of Zone S 2 in the direction of inflow is at least 100 m; it may be smaller if it is proven by hydrogeological investigations that the 52 Version: 01.02.2021 WPO 814.201 groundwater catchment or recharge facility is equally protected by low-permeability and intact covering layers. 134 Outer Protection Zone (Zone S 3) 1) Zone S 3 is intended to ensure that, in the event of imminent dangers (e.g., accidents involving substances that can pollute water), sufficient time and space are available for the necessary measures. 2) In the case of unconsolidated rock groundwater, the distance from the outer edge of Zone S 2 to the outer edge of Zone S 3 is generally at least as great as the distance from Zone S 1 to the outer edge of Zone S 2. 14 Protection Areas Protection areas are delimited in such a way that the locations of the groundwater catchments and recharge facilities can be appropriately determined and the protection zones can be delimited accordingly. 2 Measures for the Protection of Water Bodies 21 Particularly Vulnerable Water Protection Areas 211 Water Protection Areas Au and Ao 1) In water protection areas Au and Ao, no facilities may be constructed that pose a special risk to a water body; in particular, the construction of storage tanks with a useful volume of more than 250,000 l and with liquids that can pollute water in small quantities is not permitted. The Office of Environment may grant exceptions for important reasons. 2) In water protection area Au, no facilities may be constructed that are more than 3 m below the original ground level and below the mean groundwater level. The Office of Environment may grant exceptions insofar as the flow capacity of the groundwater is reduced by a maximum of 10% compared to the unaffected state. 3) The extraction of gravel, sand, and other material is governed by Art. 41 WPA. In water protection area Au: a) a protective material layer of at least 2 m above the natural, ten-year maximum groundwater level must be left in place; if the groundwater level is higher due to groundwater recharge, this level is decisive; b) the extraction area must be limited in such a way that natural groundwater recharge is guaranteed; Version: 01.02.2021 53 814.201 WPO c) the soil must be restored after extraction in such a way that its protective effect corresponds to the original one. 212 Inflow Areas Zu and Zo If water bodies are polluted during soil cultivation in the inflow areas Zu and Zo due to the runoff and leaching of substances such as plant protection products or fertilizers, the Office of Environment shall specify the measures necessary for the protection of the water. Such measures include, for example: a) use restrictions for plant protection products and for fertilizers, which the Office of Environment specifies in accordance with Annexes 2.5 no. 1.1 para. 4 and 2.6 no. 3.3.1 para. 3 of the Swiss Chemical Risk Reduction Ordinance (SR 814.81); b) restriction of arable and vegetable production areas; c) restrictions on crop selection, crop rotation, and cultivation methods; d) renunciation of ploughing up meadows in autumn; e) renunciation of converting permanent grassland into arable land; f) obligation for permanent soil cover; g) obligation to use particularly suitable technical aids, procedures, equipment, or operating methods. 22 Water Protection Zones For water protection zones, the measures and use restrictions according to the Ordinance on the Protection of Groundwater apply. 23 Protection Zones and Protection Areas For the outer protection zone (Zone S 3), the inner protection zone (Zone S 2), the catchment area (Zone S 1), and the protection areas, the measures and use restrictions of the corresponding ordinances on the protection of groundwater pumping stations or spring catchments and the corresponding ordinances on protection areas apply. 54 Version: 01.02.2021 WPO 814.201 ¹ www.eur-lex.europa.eu ² Art. 4 para. 1 amended by LGBl. 2020 No. 466. ³ Source: Swiss Association for Standardization (SNV), Bürglistrasse 29, 8400 Winterthur; www.snv.ch ⁴ Map removed for text-based translation. ⁵ Annex 2 amended by LGBl. 2020 No. 264. ⁶ Annex 3 amended by LGBl. 2020 No. 264. ⁷ One PE corresponds to an organic-biologically degradable load with a biochemical oxygen demand in 5 days of 60 g of oxygen per day.
