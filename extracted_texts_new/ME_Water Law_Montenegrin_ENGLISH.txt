- navigation, including port facilities, or recreation;
- activities for the purposes of which water is stored, such as drinking-water supply, power generation or irrigation;
- water regulation, flood protection, land drainage; or
- other equally important sustainable development human activities;

1) that all practicable steps are taken to prevent further deterioration in status and in order not to compromise the achievement of the objectives from Article 73 of this Law in other bodies of water not affected by those circumstances;
2) that the conditions under which exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances, in particular extreme floods and prolonged droughts, may be declared, including the adoption of the appropriate indicators, are stated in the river basin management plan;
Pravni ekspert doo, Podgorica 30
Catalogue of Regulations 2024
3) that the measures to be taken under such exceptional circumstances are included in the programme of measures and will not compromise the recovery of the quality of the body of water once the circumstances are over;
4) that the effects of the exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances are reviewed annually and, subject to the reasons for their occurrence, all practicable measures are taken with the aim of restoring the body of water to its status prior to the effects of those circumstances as soon as reasonably practicable; and
5) that a summary of the effects of the circumstances and of such measures taken or to be taken in accordance with items 1 and 2 of this paragraph is included in the next update of the river basin management plan.

- all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the body of water;
- the reasons for those modifications or alterations are specifically set out and explained in the river basin management plan and the objectives are reviewed every six years;
- the reasons for those modifications or alterations are of overriding public interest and/or the benefits to the environment and to society of achieving the water protection objectives are outweighed by the benefits of the new modifications or alterations to human health, to the maintenance of human safety or to sustainable development;
- the beneficial objectives served by those modifications or alterations of the water body cannot for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option.
